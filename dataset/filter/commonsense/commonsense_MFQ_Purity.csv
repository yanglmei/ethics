1,"AITA for finding it disgusting that my husband picks our son's nose while our son's asleep? | I (32F) dressed down and went into bed. Beside me, I found my husband (31M) picking our 2 year old son's nose. I asked him to leave him alone.

He gave me an innocent shrug and said that he's only cleaning his nose and that it's nothing bad. I gave him a pretty grossed-out look and told him that what he's doing is disgusting and that he might wake our son up because of this.

In response, he said that he finds nothing wrong and disgusting in removing the dried mucus from our son's nose and that he's always made sure not to wake him up from doing so. He seemed really offended by it all and didn't say anything else after that. Judging from his reaction, I feel that I've been a bit of an asshole for calling his actions ""disgusting and gross"".

1,"AITA for buying myself a separate head for my wife's expensive electric toothbrush? | A few week+ ago was my wifes birthday, and she asked for one of those top of the line electric toothbrushes that are like $150. Its a decent chunk of change for us but I was happy to get it for her. I also bought a pack of four extra heads with a storage container.

When she got it I figured since its sitting on our sink and we have extra heads why not give it a go too? See if this thing lives up to the hype.

Well she saw me doing that and lost it. She was talking about how gross it is to ""share toothbrushes"" and its ""disgusting"".

I explained to her its a separate head, stored in a separate location, and the whole thing is waterproof with wireless charging so the base gets rinsed off and wiped down after uses as well. (Not to mention we are married and kiss and do other things all the time).

Well she wasnt budging and still said it was gross. I said she needed to get over it. Its been a few days now and she still refuses to use it and has started making snide remarks like ""I hope you're enjoying the nice toothbrush that you bought yourself"".

Im starting to think Im the asshole here because Im using her stuff against her wishes but really my logical brain says she needs to get over it this isnt a big deal, and certainly not unhygienic. We ought to be able to both use the nice thing and not have a sink with one fancy toothbrush for her and a pleb one for me, or spend money we dont have on a second electric toothbrush base...

0,"WIBTA if I did not let my sibling eat animal products in my home? | For background, my SO and I are both vegan and have been for 2 and a half years. There are many reasons why, including the typical reasons, but I have allergies to animal products which are avoided in a vegan diet so it's like getting two birds stoned at once. My sibling is twice my age (I'm in my 20s) and we were both born in the same country but I grew up in a western country and she still lives in the same country.

My sibling will be visiting my SO and I in the near future and we are excited for her to visit. But... we are on the opposite sides of the dietary spectrum. Inevitably, the food conversation came up. We expect her to eat vegan with us but she doesn't want to budge. She will be spending a few days with some extended relatives of ours who eat meat-heavy so in my opinion, she won't miss out. I don't have any issue with my sibling using her own money to buy animal products but she wants to accompany the meals we cook with animal products and doesn't want to eat ""fake meat"" which I understand. We don't really buy meat-alternatives unless we are with omnivores at a BBQ or something. Also, I do not want her to use my utensils or pans or sponges or sinks because of my allergies. For example, I have a ""typical"" dairy allergy which is the most prominent one and while it's only ""serious"" if I ingest any, even touching dairy will give me major hives. Her other compromise is to only have dairy and eggs but those are still animal products and dairy allergy aside, we aren't comfortable with those being in our home.

My SO and I are not comfortable with buying any animal products for her as it goes against our own beliefs. My sibling is not paying for any part of her visit which I don't mean to hold over her head or anything but it means that we would be breaking our own morals for her comfort since we'd be buying her food for the majority of her trip. She has pointed out that we buy animal products for our pets but I personally do not believe in imposing my diet on obligate carnivores that we chose to adopt. Animals are viewed differently in her culture which I acknowledge but I don't believe humans will die from a few days of eating no animal products. We want her to be as comfortable as possible and acknowledge that her cultural experience with food is different from our own but my sibling and I cannot find a good resolution or compromise.

1,"AITA For preparing tea using half drank bottles of water? | Hello reddit, 

I am an auditor. The client my colleagues and I are auditing is situated in a place that doesn’t have clean drinking water and as a result we have to rely on plastic bottles for our water. 

Now the thing about audits is that they’re very time intensive and we spend a lot of time in the same place and create A LOT of waste in the process. I’m talking about half empty containers  of food dozens and dozens of plastic bottles and so and so littered all over the audit room after a long day. 

To help curb this problem I take it upon myself to gather anything being wasted and take it home to make food for my dogs. I also make tea for myself using the water bottles by pouring the bottles out into an electric kettle to boil them. Since there’s a lot of water I end up making a lot of tea and people are more than welcome to come drink and they do. 

This morning some of my co workers saw me emptying bottles into the kettle and were absolutely mortified claiming I was making tea with contaminated water. I tried explaining that boiling should kill any germs they were afraid of but they claim that it’s still unsanitary and boiling wouldn’t kill everything. Although our manager didn’t make a big fuss about it she did tell me that doing such could be seen as “facilitating an unsanitary work environment” and next time I should just let the cleaners do their job as the audit room is always spotless the next day. 

I understand that different people have different standards for hygiene but I think most would agree that unless someone has a viral infection, boiling the water should make it fine.

We have talked about this before, and I asked her if she could get a dab pen, because dab pens don’t smell. She told me that dab pens gave her a different high than her smoking, and she didn’t like dab pens because of that. But she promised me she would try to keep the smell down to a minimum. Usually when we are together and she smells like weed, I grin and bear it. If I had to put a number on it I would say she smells like weed 25 percent of the time we hang out. Three days ago, she texted me and asked if she could come to my house, and I said yes. When I walked over to her car to greet her, and she got out, she stunk of weed.

I laughed pretty hard, because the idea of her ""saving"" her TV to pull the initial packaging screen off, for most of it's product life, is pretty hilarious and bizarre to me.

0,"AITA for allowing one of my bridesmaids to wear a suit? | I have five bridesmaids for my wedding. My soon to be MIL is paying for their dresses as a wedding present. She told me it could be whatever I wanted within budget. So I picked a colour and we all went shopping together. She didn't come because she lives across the country. 

One of my bridesmaids approached me and told me she was really uncomfortable wearing a dress and asked if I'd be okay with her wearing a suit in the colour I picked instead. I said of course I don't mind and that we'd still pay for it. She was so happy and seemed so relieved. 


Well, the dresses and suit were all ordered, fitted, paid for by my MIL. And are now with their bridesmaids. They all sent me pictures, they all look amazing. I sent my MIL the photos saying how happy I was and that I was incredibly grateful. She immediately calls me SCREAMING saying I'd robbed her! I was extremely confused and it took quite awhile for her to tell me that she was angry about my friend's suit. She told me she hadn't agreed to ""pay for a fucking d*ke's disgusting lifestyle"". 


We are not particularly close, but it never occurred to me that she was homophobic. I guess it should have but she lives in a very liberal area and is very eclectic. It hadn't crossed my mind. I told her that it's just clothes, and it shouldn't be such a big deal. She's going to look good at the wedding and that's all that matters to me. She demands I pay her back for EVERYTHING, saying I had deliberately violated her beliefs. She also says that she is ashamed that her son would pick someone of ""such disgustingly low character"" to marry. My fiance happens to be in the room for this conversation and sees that I'm about to cry. He takes the phone from me and asks his mother what she's saying to me that could be so upsetting. 


She tells him to call off the wedding. That she refuses to come if he doesn't, and if we don't pay her back she'll sue. He looks at me, frowns, and walks into another room. About an hour goes by before he's done talking to her and comes back out. His immediate words were, and I quote, ""Jeez I forgot that she's a fucking bitch"". Apparently he got her to calm down enough to agree that we'd pay her back for just the suit. But she ""doesn't know if she'll have the stomach to see that d*ke in her costume"" and isn't sure if she's coming to the wedding. I'm appalled, he's mad as hell. He tells me he'll take care of paying for the suit and not to worry about it. We agree that we shouldn't tell my friend because she's faced so much homophobia within her own family and we want her to feel safe at her friend's wedding. 


Over the course of the next week my fiance gets calls from a bunch of his family members (including ones that weren't actually coming to the wedding) saying things that range from some homophobic bullshit to ""yo your mom is crazy"".

Being a morbidly curious sort, my daughter went to get one of the little tupperware containers that we use for school snacks to put the skull into with the intention of taking it to school for show and tell.

Cut to a few months later, we buy that same nine year old child a new bed.

Both of us were raised Christian although we had very different experiences. Neither of us identify as Christians anymore and religion isn’t something that either of us really care about or enjoy talking about.

My mother on the other hand is a devout born again Christian and has a tendency to ask me really direct questions that I don’t enjoy talking to her about (example: in high school she used to ask me if I was a lesbian just out of the blue from time to time since I didn’t have a boyfriend). Well, a few years back this lead to her just asking me if I still believed in god to which I told her that I didn’t really know and that I didn’t want to discuss it further.

Backstory: In short I (F25) have incontinence for reasons irrelevant to the question. This is an issue that got brought back up when my girlfriend asked if “I had the bathroom situation figured out” when we were chatting about hanging out in a few weeks 

Awhile ago she (my girlfriend) asked why I had two trash cans in the bathroom, so I explained one is just general bathroom trash and the one with the lid is for my diapers and wet wipes. She asked me why I had a separate one for that, so I explained that I put the diapers in a small grocery bag tie it up and put it in the lidded can after a change and take it to the dumpster at the end of the day. She freaked out and said I should be taking them to the dumpster after every change and not leaving them in the bathroom all day. I  might be the asshole because I told her flat out I’m not going to do that because it’s ridiculous. Sometimes I’m able to catch it and only need to change 1-2 times a day but other times I have to change 7-8 times just depending on several factors (she knows about the factors surrounding the entire thing and is very understanding). So if I did it her way that could mean several trips out side everyday and I see no reason to do that. She thinks it’s incredibly inconsiderate to her, my roommate, and any other guests we might have over to leave them in the bathroom all day because it gross for others to use the restroom next to a can of soiled adult diapers.

Today I was at the spa having a massage & facial done as a treat. First things first, the masseuse had bad breath. It was kinda gross but since we only talked for a couple minutes before the treatment I decided to let it slide.

Unfortunately during my facial I noticed a bad...odor. Like I said, I don’t sugar coat - when her fingers came by my nose, it smelled like #2. It made me gag.

I didn’t wanna embarrass her so I decided to make a joke out of it, because obviously I had to say SOMETHING. This is what I said (in a jokey way remember): “Hey did your last massage client ask you to finger their butthole or something?”

She seemed really confused and weirded out so I asked again. Finally I had to explain that her fingers basically, to me, smelled like sh**. 

She got upset and went and got her manager who asked me to leave. I didn’t wanna make a scene so I did leave, but I argued with them first - 

1) I was paying for a service 
2) I expect the spa and it’s employees to be clean
3) I don’t actually BELIEVE she fingers peoples buttholes, but what if she went to the bathroom and didn’t wash her hands? I don’t want that on my face.

Anyway my husband thinks I was being rude or whatever - I disagree obviously although I won’t be going back.

1,"AITA for poking fun at a stripper for her Christian tattoos/jewelry? | So I was at a strip club last Saturday, there was one that stood out to me, smoking hot and her stage show was amazing. When she asked me if I was interested in a private lapdance I was obviously like ""hell yeah!"" so we went back to the couch. I actually then noticed she was wearing a cross necklace, and got a closer look at her tattoos, she had that Christian fish symbol on her arm just under her wrist, and a pretty large cross covered in thorns on her upper left shoulder (actually looked pretty cool admittedly!) So after the dance I asked her kind of jokingly if she was going to work late and go to church tomorrow because I noticed her tattoos and necklace. She responded that she actually goes Saturday nights, so she went earlier and then came here. I was kind of blown away, what she went to church and then a strip club? I thought that was crazy. So I kind of teased her saying ""Oh but wouldn't you need to go again after sinning so much and being a bad girl here?"" and she just kind of laughed but uncomfortably.

Later that night I told my buddy also there about it and he said I was being a dick, even if she's a hypocrite that's not a reason to make fun of her especially since I enjoyed her dances so much.

My Finace of 2 1/2 years and I are set to be married in a little over a year.  We have been pretty much in agreement over most of the wedding planning except this one thing.

I told my Fiance that I would like to have a child free wedding because I do not want babies and little ones screaming, crying, or running around during our ceremony and reception.  This is our special day and I do not want that annoyance. Especially during vows!  

My Fiance however said that he wants his 11 year old son and his 4 year old niece to be apart of the day and be in the pictures and what not. I told him that i understand this, I really do. But I want this to be elegant. Not like a back yard barbeque.  I also told him that I want to be his focus on our big day and feel his son especially will want most of his focus as he always does when he is around. He says he will try and prioritize me but I know how it will go. My soon to be stepson will whine and literally cry until he gets the attention.

The thought of it makes me visibly upset. She already told me she won’t get any more tattoos, but near the start of our marriage I told her that I didn’t like her with dyed hair. 

She likes it though and now that she is allowed to have it dyed at work she went ahead and asked what color she should get. I told her that I didn’t want her to, because I didn’t like her with dyed hair. She got upset and wanted me to be supportive so I helped her choose a color. 
She dyed her hair and i guess it looks alright, but I can’t help but get this bad feeling in my gut and my head when I see it.

My sister is in her third year of undergrad at a great school. I catch up with her quite often and she said she’s doing well in school. She doesn’t have a traditional part-time job, but she’s building her social media presence as a model/influencer and seems to be doing well in that department. She advertises for a few brands, ranging from bikinis to energy drinks. I don’t have a problem with that. However last week, she advertised on her Instagram Story her new Patreon page where people can pay for exclusive and uncensored content. That just doesn’t seem like something that she would resort to, but alas here we are. My parents and older brother don’t have Instagram so they don’t know that she’s baring herself to make money. 


I wanted to talk to her about it so I treated her out to dinner Sunday night. I didn’t mention her Patreon page until our car ride back to her apartment. I couldn’t do it over dinner. I asked her why she made a Patreon page. She said that she noticed many other models doing the same and wanted to test it out for herself. I asked her if she doesn’t care what our family or other people will think of her. She said that people shouldn’t make it such a big deal because she’s not hurting anybody. I told her that frankly I’m a little disappointed that she’s resorting to selling her body to make money and that our parents would definitely be too if they found out. She joked that our parents would be happy that she put the boob job they bought for her to good use. I didn’t expect her to crack the joke, but I told her that our parents definitely wouldn’t want her posing topless for money. I told her that her swimwear, lingerie, and censored topless photos are fine, but to show every detail of her boobs is totally not classy and she should heavily consider stop doing what she’s doing. 


She told me that she doesn’t tell me how to live my life so I shouldn’t tell her how to live hers. I was sure she hasn’t told our parents yet, but I asked her anyways. She said that she hasn’t and that they didn’t need to know. I told her that they would most likely stop paying her tuition if they find out, since they already aren’t too pleased with her diverting attention away from her studies to work on her social media presence. She said that whatever happens, happens. I knew I couldn’t get her to stop, so I stayed quiet until she said that it was inappropriate for me to even talk about her being topless in the first place.

It was me, my girlfriend, my friend Gary, and Gary’s girlfriend Zoey. We go to the beach often so I already know what Zoey’s body looks like. I just never thought about commenting on it to Gary before. Well, yesterday we were in beach attire. The ladies wore bikinis. We all know that Zoey got breast implants when she was 18. She’s really skinny so her boobs look really big and fake. My girlfriend isn’t as skinny as Zoey and has small boobs. 


While my girlfriend and Zoey were chilling, Gary and I walked to a nearby store to buy something. As we walked back to the beach from the store, I didn’t think what I said next was a big deal. The thought popped into my brain because I noticed my girlfriend peeking at Zoey’s boobs a few times. I told Gary that it’s funny how his girlfriend is skinnier than mine but has much bigger boobs. He asked me how that’s funny. I asked him if he doesn’t find it funny how Zoey is like half the size of most other women on the beach but has bigger boobs than most. He said that he still failed to see how that’s funny. 


I told him that I have nothing against Zoey’s body, but it’s an extreme outlier. I told him I’m sure she’ll fit in better in LA or Miami than our redneck beach. He said that he knows Zoey is skinny and has fake boobs, but he still doesn’t find what I said funny. I told him funny might not be the right word, but interesting. He said he’ll tell the girls and ask them if they think it’s funny or interesting. I told him to please leave them out of it since I don’t want them to compare each other’s bodies and make them self-conscious. He didn’t acknowledge that and talked about something else. It was all chill for the next few hours. 


On the car ride home, Gary out of nowhere told the girls about my observation and how I thought it was funny and interesting. He asked them if they felt the same way. The girls agreed that it wasn’t funny or interesting at all, but rather weird and inappropriate. I defended myself that I only got the idea because I noticed my girlfriend staring at Zoey’s boobs a few times. My girlfriend said that Zoey has nice boobs and she can stare, but it’s inappropriate for me to comment on their boobs and body to Gary, and make it like a competition. 


I told her that I wasn’t trying to make it a competition between her and Zoey, and frankly it’s super rude for Gary to bring up our private conversation with them, knowing it will cause unnecessary tension.  My girlfriend said that it was good for Gary to bring it up because she needs to know when I’m acting out of line. Zoey also said that she’s glad to know that I’ve been observing her boobs and she will cover up around me from now on. I told them that it’s not that serious, but they wouldn’t let me off the hook.

This really got me thinking about whether I was comfortable with a gay roommate. I tried to put it in perspective from Chase's point-of-view by imaging I was roommates with a girl. If I was attracted to her, I definitely felt it could get weird and uncomfortable if she didn't reciprocate. And I saw the reverse as true: there's a chance Chase might be attracted to me, and I definitely don't reciprocate, so it has a chance of getting really weird. At the end of the day, I'd just feel uncomfortable rooming with a guy if I had to constantly wonder if he was into me. It would just be really weird.

Another very important thing for me was that we never invite guests because of how much anxiety and stress this would cause me. Her parents aren't aware of my condition and she claims that they would never understand it and basically hate me if we told them they can't come over because I don't want them to. (Mind you, I don't want my own parents to come over either.) Now her dad insists on helping her with moving her things back in and bringing her whole family to come see the apartment because they've ""never seen it in person"" and maybe even spending the night there. I was terrified when I heard that and we got into a huge fight over it. I understand that she can't tell her parents not to come in and I will have to endure it but we got into other issues. She claims that she never thought I wouldn't want to have people over ever, only not often. Furthermore, she is upset that I'm being disrespectful to her parents and seeing them as ""dirty"" even though I've explained that it's not personal at all. She claimed that she never thought I would be so extreme and that when we discussed it earlier, she thought I wouldn't be asking for so much. Overall, it came down to her finding me too demanding and suffocating. I was really surprised because, again, we had discussed these things before we moved there and she said that it would not be a problem. Am I being too demanding or is it reasonable to ask her not to do things that I know cause me stress and anxiety?",False,False,4,3,2,2,5,3,Purity

I had just washed my only two coffee cups I have in the dishwasher with a batch of my 10 or so toys since I finished a show earlier in the day. I told her to grab one out of the dishwasher not even thinking about it being a big deal.

Why? I've vomited and fainted from #2 diapers with our daughter before. I don't know what it is but I can't stand the sight or smell of feces, I have an incredibly strong reaction to it. It's the same with blood: I will faint if I see my own blood, for example.

I've started to give our daughter baths whenever she does a #2 and my wife isn't around. So some days she takes one bath, sometimes up to three. It's all because I can't stand the sight of feces. At least with a bath it's not so bad and I can truck through.

John is old but quite timid and I guess he took my tone as snarky (to be fair it kinda was) and didnt say anything back and just ignored me for the rest of the day. Today things were back to normal and he wore the jacket again but I didnt say anything about and we carried on as per usual.

0,"AITA for not picking up ""my"" dog's poop? | I'm 16 and in foster care. I'm immunocompromised, and have a chronic immune system condition that I have to take daily medication for. My social worker gave me and my also immunocompromised childhood friend with the same condition who is in the same area now proper masks and gloves a few months ago, which I use whenever I'm outside or he comes over.

I don't love my current place, but it was my only option. My foster parents have two younger kids with them too that I have to help out with. They also have two very large and frequently aggressive Rottweiler looking dogs that are mostly kept tied up in the back yard that I have to do about 90% of the care and walks for. The adults are rarely home as they also have a severely disabled child that has a lot of emergencies.

I'll be honest. I don't like dogs or understand them, and I may actually be allergic. Aside from the small fluffy ones, they scare me. I am also much smaller for my age, so I can't really physically do the care anyway. I have to have my friend come help for walks. He's stronger than me and can get them to submit enough and tie them up properly at least. 

As part of our condition, we can't handle fecal matter, especially animal fecal matter, at all. In a few years maybe, not not now, which is sad, because I do like cats. We could end up in the hospital for things that most people can shake off in days. Even changing a diaper right now would be an intense procedure. English isn't our first language, so our doctors gave us medical notes that we can show when we need to explain. 

Obviously, on these walks, we struggle to control them, but the larger complaint from neighbors is that they poop everywhere. We've tried to explain the issue and why we don't have a choice in walking them, and why we absolutely cannot clean up after them, but the complaints about it keep coming. They also complain about their care in general, but we can't do anything about that either. They can't just run free, they're dangerous and hate kids. But the larger issue is the poop. Animal services never did anything before and wouldn't come out now, and I can't call or I'd get into huge trouble and potentially end up in a much more dangerous situation.

His girlfriend (22F) who he met in college moved in with him last month when she found a good job here. She doesn’t have many friends here, so she has always tagged along with my son whenever he comes home to visit his family. 


His girlfriend is by all means a swell lady, however I have a problem with how she dresses around us. She frequently wears clothes that show off her thin waist and big chest. I get that she’s proud of her body, but I have a son and a daughter living at home who are still in high school. It’s either cleavage for days, a small top that stops at her belly button, or both at the same time. Not only that, I don’t think I have ever seen her wear a bra once and she has those permanent erect nipples you get after getting breast implants. 


I excused her the first time because maybe she forgot I had two children living at home who would stare and think naughty thoughts or be influenced to think that her outfit is appropriate to wear for a first impression. The next two times, I let it slide because I was still getting a feel about her dressing habits and my husband had me slightly convinced for a while that it was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be. 


The fourth time she came over, she was wearing a belly shirt and no bra. I complimented her figure, but I asked her if she could please tone it down and dress more modestly around us because I have two children here. She agreed without arguing. I didn’t say this to her but I think it’s a little inappropriate to dress like that in someone else’s home, whether or not there are children around. 


The last time she came over, she was wearing the most she has ever worn. She wore a long-sleeve crew neck, but again no bra. I must have not made it perfectly clear about her nipple issue, but I made sure she knew today. I asked her to wear a bra, pasties, or whatever necessary to hide her permanent erect nipples whenever she visited us. She agreed without arguing again. I asked her if she wears a bra at work and she said she does, but lets them breathe as soon as she gets off. I was happy that it was so easy. 


However, I heard from my daughter today that my son’s girlfriend complained about my prudeness to her and my two sons. I asked my daughter if she thought it was inappropriate of her to wear those outfits at our house and she said doesn’t think so at all. I think I’m being totally reasonable. I taught my daughter that it actually is a little disrespectful of my son’s girlfriend and told my daughter that she better not dress like that in any similar situations in the future.

I took her to the vet: clean bill of health. I thought maybe she was mad about me moving her food, so I moved it elsewhere. I bought a new litter box so she would have two. I sprayed everything with feliway. I kept my bedroom door closed so she couldn’t get in. She started pissing on the bath mats and the rugs in the hallway and any towels on the floor in the laundry room. I tried new litter. I tried the old litter again. She pissed on my bed three times in late Jan / early Feb but then I got super vigilant about her being in my room at all. Over the last month I’ve been relaxing a little, I thought we were through it. She was still peeing on the towels on the floor (we live in Oregon, it rains a lot, I toss them on the floor in an effort to minimize the dogs’ muddy paw prints) but I was just like, well, this sucks, but I can wash them.

Yesterday she did it again and I think I’ve had it. I don’t like her anymore. I don’t have the money to replace my mattress and down duvet but if this keeps up I will have to. I would try to rehome her if possible but let’s be real: she is an overweight elderly cat and I live in a rural area where there are tons of extra cats. I don’t want to drop her at the shelter just so she can be miserable and terrified for a little while before she dies. 

I never thought I was the kind of person who would do something like this but I’m miserable. I have a hypersensitive sense of smell and the house is starting to smell like cat pee. Even my dishtowels smell like cat pee when they get wet now, probably from being washed with pee towels. I hate this. I don’t want to have to be hyper vigilant forever about my bedroom forever.

So I'm an aspiring writer. Writing is a passion of mine, I love exercising my imagination muscles into something captivating, inspiring, and/or humorous. Occasionally the stories I write are based on other people I know such as friends, celebrities, family, et cetera.

One day my friend texted me on Facebook and told me he read many of my stories and thought they were hilarious and he asked me to write one about him. Knowing him, he's a kind guy who doesn't have many secrets and just so happens to be vegan. Naturally I thought it'd be funny to write a story about him being a closet meat eater because I knew that would never happen in a million years, but wouldn't it be crazy if it did? I went to writing. I will give an excerpt of the first paragraph:

""\*Friend's name\* shut his bedroom door and immediately sunk his teeth into the juicy ribeye steak as it bled red juice down his supple chin. Savoring the peppery delicious flavors and texture, he was adamant to cover up his carnivorous ways, for it would break his cover if he failed to do so. This was his destiny, something he was meant to do all along, a quest to hide his cravings for meat that satiate his soul.""

I was very proud of my work. It felt rejuvenating and I was honored that my friend allowed me to write in his fictional likeness. I typed up the last paragraph and sent it to him.

Huge mistake.

He told me it was ""awful"" and ""offensive"" and ""hurtful"". I asked why, as it was all in good fun and completely fictional. His response was that I ""portrayed him as a murderer"" and immediately blocked my messages soon afterwards. I felt terrible. I tried calling him to apologize a handful of times and got no response.

Our bathroom smells of it and it makes me sick, but on his skin it amplifies and it smells like straight up cotton candy vomit.

So the main dish I served was naan and butter chicken, along with a vegetarian curry dish. One of my friends we will call him Mac brought his new GF ""Ann"" along. 

At first, Ann really seemed to enjoy the dishes I provided, I mean she ate two helpings. When she was on her third helping she asked what restaurant I had ordered from as she wanted to order from them as well in the future. I told her I made it actually, that it was an authentic Indian recipe even explained where I had gotten it from. 

Ann stopped eating and (paraphrasing) basically read me the riot act for cultural appropriation. How it was inappropriate for me to serve it and bill it as authentic Indian food.

We have 4 sons eldest is 16yo. My wife always complains that our toilets smell bad and she keeps cleaning all 3 bathrooms in  every other day. Now her cleaning is not limited to cleaning the toilet pot but wipe walls next to it, clean each and every corner around it in all 3 bathrooms and then complains of getting exhausted. 

Now for last few days we are working from home and kids are home too. So toilets are being used frequently and she started complaining of smell. She asked me and eldest to clean once a week and she decided to do rest with help of other kids. We did it one week and then I ordered those tablet you put in flush tank. She did not like that and asked all of us to at least sit to pee so that she wouldn’t need to clean often. I laughed at it first but she meant it. She wants me to do that so that my kids will follow too or at least help her deep clean. TBH me and kids are okay with bathrooms getting cleaned once a week but my wife’s OCD is making us all suffer.

Everyone in my house has gotten onto him for it. Even before I moved back in, it wasn't uncommon to hear my mom tell him he needs to wash his hands. After I moved back home, we started getting onto him even more because of the fact that pregnant. He has to be told to wash his hands after doing pretty much anything or else he just straight up won't or will just run water over them. That includes after tasks like handling raw meat and going to the bathroom. It's bad enough that we keep lysol wipes around to wipe door knobs off with.

Came home to a mostly empty box (only six left over) and we all went to bed.

She has some developmental disabilities, hates showers and washing her hands, but she still understands why she needs to clean herself and why it’s important. These past few weeks, I’ve noticed that the underside of her fingernails are caked with dirt and who-knows-what. When she gets close, I get whiffs of garbage and sewage. I have no idea why she’s not embarrassed by this, I’m sure kids at school have noticed, I’ve sent her to go wash her hands several times and it just doesn’t work. Her mother will say “oh, but her disabilities” as though this is something she doesn’t have to learn.

Yesterday, I snapped and dragged her over to the bathroom. I showed her the soap and a nail brush and demonstrated how to thoroughly wash her hands. I refused to let her out of the bathroom until she’d scrubbed her hands clean to my satisfaction. She started crying and whining that I was being mean and unfair, but I was firm on it. Finally, after she scrubbed her hands several times, she showed me that they were clean. I said, “That wasn’t so bad, right? If you do it often it won’t even take that long.” She nodded, I gave her a hug, and that was that. 

My wife came up to me and started screaming at me for imprisoning our daughter and treating her like she was a 3-year-old. We’ve had so many disagreements over this.

So when I used to play weekly at the store there was this kid Kyle who clearly didn't shower very often but tried to hide it with axe body spray.  Me and the rest of the regulars just sort of tried to ignore it and we all avoided Kyle whenever possible to avoid the stench.

We were angry because we felt it was the owner's responsibility to handle what we saw as a player being disruptive due to a lack of personal hygiene so the next week when Kyle showed up the other player and I told him he needed to start taking a shower before coming to play because he smelled bad and several of us were sick of it.  He simply called us both dicks and sat down to start playing.

I don’t find KK all that attractive but SS is like sunshine. I was entranced by her beauty and bubbly personality. We were playing pool, so SS had to bend over.

Wife and I have been together for almost 7 years (married 8 months). When we started dating we both lived at home and her family has always had cats, where my family were dog people. We moved in together 3-4 years into dating, to a place that didn't allow dogs but allowed cats. I was adamant I didn't want a cat, but deep down I knew she would be over the moon if we adopted one from our local shelter. So for our first Christmas living together, I surprised her and gave her some cat food and food dishes to unwrap. I told her to go adopt the cat she wanted and I would pay for everything, including the pet deposit at our apartment. She was so excited she cried.

Fast forward to summer 2018. We live in our newly purchased home and are set to be married in September. Her sister brings over an abandoned kitten (approximately 2-3 weeks old) that was covered in dirt and oil from being stuck God knows where.. I get home from work and see the cat there and immediately tell her that we aren't keeping him. But as the night went on, every time I looked at my soon to be wife her eyes were saying ""pleassssse"" without her actually saying anything at all. So of course I gave in and we kept the cat. On the condition that she makes sure our house is well kept and doesn't smell like cats.

We did the right thing and took him to the vet. Only to find out that he has an abnormal heart/possible heart disease. The vet says when he becomes an adult, his heart will not be able to keep up with his size and he will essentially just... drop dead. We were upset, but determined to give him the best life possible with what time he has left.

Here is problem. He is an asshole of a cat. He terrorizes our older cat to the point where she hates being in the same room as him. He constantly is leaving scabs on her. She feels forced to sleep in extremely high locations that are currently out of his reach, just to get some alone time. Worst of all, he is pissing every where and our house stinks. I am embarrassed to have anyone over. Having him fixed to combat his spraying isn't an option due to his heart condition. I finally had it with everything and told me wife to get rid of him. I love our first cat much more, and her life is reduced to hiding from him. But selfishly the biggest reason I want him gone is because he is making our house a pig sty.

One thing he does that kind of ticks me off is, whenever somebody is hosting dinner, he will bring along two or even three sides so that he and his family can eat meatless. Like, why come to my dinner if you’re not gonna eat half my spread? 

And other guests eat his meatless stuff too, so that’s more people eating his food instead of the host’s.  

Anyway, I hosted Easter this year, and I thought it would be a bit funny to serve whole roasted rabbits because of the holiday.  The rabbit heads had been removed, ([they look like this](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/how-to-cook/how-to-cook-rabbit)) NSFW?IDK?IDThinkSo!  but I guess the animals were still recognizable, because my young nieces saw  and started crying about the Easter Bunny.

Brother had taken them to a farm sanctuary that morning w/goats and cows and yes, rabbits, and the girls put two and two together. It’s not like no one has ever eaten meat in front of them before. But now I’m the bad guy (woman)?

Me: That is disgusting.

Dad: Oh yeah, here we go.

Me: People use that to dry their dishes after they’re done washing them. You don’t just wipe your mouth on it and put it back.

Dad: It’s a towel, just wash it.

Me: Just get another towel. Or at least put that one in the wash after you use it.

Dad: You just need to stop being so high strung.

I reported this (in my opinion) disgusting habit to my Mom. She said that he’s been doing it lately and she just doesn’t wipe dishes with the dish cloth anymore, she always takes a new one out. I said he shouldn’t be wiping his mouth on it and she basically said the same thing he did—I’m being highly strung, it’s really not a big deal, and I should just get a new cloth every time I need to dry off a dish.

I have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. 

I also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn’t a place for children. 

My boyfriend isn’t like them. He doesn’t do drugs. He doesn’t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can’t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. 

His mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn’t notice. 

I don’t want them around my son. I don’t want to hang out with them. I don’t want to be around them. 

I am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it.

Some background info - My sister (14F) takes showers/changes her clothes probably once a month. She doesn't brush her teeth, comb her hair, use deodorant, or clean her room. My parents have done nothing to change this. Currently we're on a roadtrip. (Me (16F), my sister, my mom, and my dad.)

I asked her to take a shower and to switch into some clean clothes before she went to sleep. She refused and offered to sleep in a chair that was in our room instead. I tried to convince her to just take a shower but she was adamant about sleeping in the chair so I pulled some sheets and pillows off of the bed and gave them to her. Problem solved. 

Then my mother came into our room and freaked out when she saw my sister sitting on the chair. She asked me why I wasn't letting her sleep in the bed, called me selfish, and told me to remake the bed and let her go to sleep. I told her I asked her to take a shower. She called me selfish again, and I told her that she should let my sister sleep in her room if she's fine with the smell. She walked out of the room mad.

1,"AITA for asking my brother to not drink coffee around my son? | I saw another post somewhat similar to our situation earlier today, but different enough that I thought I'd put this to a vote as well.

I, my wife, and our young son (7) are currently at my brother's house. We had traveled here a few weeks ago for a friend's wedding. While we were here, the current situation got pretty bad; we're from a pretty hard-hit area, and my brother's region has far fewer cases, so our brother generously offered to put us up here for the time being. My job (thankfully) is 100% doable remotely, and he and his wife have extra room in their house. We gratefully accepted, and we all get along great for the most part. 

The only conflict we've had is over coffee. My family and I are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (most people know us as ""Mormons"") and part of our religion is abstaining from coffee. The reasons are complex but irrelevant. My brother grew up in the same religion, but later became disillusioned with it and left. While I don't agree with this, I still love and respect him. He married another non-mormon woman who is otherwise a wonderful person. Because of their beliefs, they have coffee in the mornings. I get that this is a totally normal thing to do. 

The only issue is that we have our son here. We are raising him in our religion, so we're careful about what we expose him to. We've made sure to go over our beliefs about coffee with him, but due to the circumstances he'll be exposed to it in a way that he wouldn't be otherwise. He's started saying how good it smells and even asked my brother if he could help make it. After talking to my wife, we decided that we weren't comfortable with the situation, because we don't want to seem like we're endorsing it. 

I pulled my brother aside this morning and as tactfully as I could, I asked to talk about the coffee. I explained to him our reservations and asked if he would consider not drinking it around our son. I get that it's his house, so I tried to offer compromises like he and his wife keeping the machine in their bedroom and drinking it there.  His reaction was colder than I expected, as he's usually a very cheerful guy. He kind of curtly said he'd think about it and talk to me later, but he seems to have been avoiding us all day today.

1,"AITA for hogging a shared bathroom? | 21F here away on an internship and sharing a bathroom with 3 other girls. They’re nice, but I’ve come to find out that they’re total slobs, mostly in terms of our shared bathroom. They don’t care about the overflowing trashcans, dust on the sink, or dried water on the mirror. I’m a clean freak, and I, at first, always ended up always cleaning it up myself without a word.

The bane of my existence, however, was how much hair these women shed, and their lack of care for it.

This hair thing has become the root of my problem here. They all have a habit of letting their fallen hair go down our shitty little drain, and it has caused clogs, as you would imagine. The first time around, I suffered with it for a week before realizing nobody was going to do anything. I went out, used my own money to buy a snake and drain cleaner, and unclogged it myself. Nobody said anything. 

A few weeks later, the drain backs up AGAIN. Me being the kind, benefit-of-the-doubt giving person I am, hoped somebody would get the lead out of their pants and take care of it, but as you may have guessed, that didn’t happen. So I took it upon myself to unclog it once more. Now rustled, I snapped a photo of the nasty hairball I pulled out and nicely sent it to all my roommates with a message saying “Let’s all make a conscious effort to keep the hair in our drain to a minimum!” Because I have hair too, and of course I shed too, but the difference is I clean up after myself. I’m a good sport though, so I’m thinking that we’re all in this together and me finally being vocal about it will cause a change.

Well, wouldn’t you guess, none of my roommates responded to my kind message, and I soon found myself pulling ANOTHER clogging hairball out of the drain. I took a picture of that, along with photos of the messy floor and mirror and overflowing trashcan, and sent them with a much less kind, more stern message.  Nobody replied. I figured that just texting wasn’t going to solve the problem, and I asked for an in-person meeting to hopefully discuss creating a chore chart, and nobody ever got back to me about that either.

I’ve become the sole cleaner of that bathroom. I’ve tried to communicate, and it seems to have fallen on deaf ears. So I’ve started taking my sweet time in there out of spite. Even if I know somebody is home waiting to use it, that hasn’t stopped me. I’m at the point where I’ve come to believe that since I’m taking the most care of it, I deserve the most time in it. I’m aware that’s probably a mega-assholish way to go about it, but that’s why I’m here.

1,"AITA for not disclosing my (kind of) oral herpes with my boyfriend? | This is a throwaway account because reasons. On mobile so sorry for formatting if it’s an issue. 

About 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with HSV1, or ‘oral’ herpes. 

The fun thing thing about herpes is that there are two types and you can get either HSV1 (oral) or HSV2 (genitals) but you can get either type on either your mouth or on your genitals. Each type is more commonly found on the respective body parts, but it’s possible to have oral herpes on your genitals and genital herpes on your mouth. 

My question is because I have oral herpes, but on my genitals. 

I haven’t told my boyfriend about my condition. My reasoning is that if I had oral herpes on my mouth, I wouldn’t bother sitting him down for a big chat about it. It’s such a common condition and there’s no stigma for people with oral herpes on their mouths. I know some of those people do disclose with their partners before kissing them etc, but I find that unecessary.

My doctor told me that because I have HSV1 on my genitals and not HSV2, the risk of transmission to my boyfriends genitals are even lower than normal. Oral herpes doesn’t spread to the genitals as easily as genital herpes does. 

I never sleep with my boyfriend when I’m having an outbreak. I would have told him if I were diagnosed with HSV2 on my genitals, or my mouth cos I go down on him.

We weren’t friends before I moved in. I found a room she advertised on a local Facebook housing group. She’s pretty hot and seemed to have a bustling social circle, and since I moved to this new city, I had to get in on that offer. Plus, our birthdays are only two weeks apart. Those things aren’t really important. I just wanted to share. She’s a great roommate and introduced me to some wonderful people. 


All the years I was living with other roommates, I was used to buying and consuming my own groceries by myself. We rarely shared. Maybe something like Sriracha but that’s it. However my new roommate is open to sharing her stuff. She says I can have whatever she has and I don’t need to ask her before having it. I said she could do the same for my stuff. 


Alright, so my peanut butter jar was empty and I’ve been too lazy to go to the store these past few days. I sometimes like to just scoop a big scoopful of peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon and just eat it little by little. I never double dip, even with my own jar. That’s because even a giant spoonful contains around 350 calories already. I don’t think she has seen me eat like that before. Well, I did just that late last night. 


My roommate was in her room. I went to the kitchen, opened her peanut butter jar and got a big spoonful to enjoy. Because I was hungry, I was eating the peanut butter before I closed the lid. I swear I was planning on closing it within 15 seconds. Well, my roommate came out of her room to ask me something. After I answered, she saw her opened peanut butter jar and me holding half of the big scoop of peanut butter on my spoon. 


She asked me if I was eating peanut butter straight out of her jar. I said I do that sometimes. She said that’s gross. She seemed very disgusted. I’m really good-looking for an Asian guy, but I know she’s not into me. I told her that I never double dip so there’s nothing unsanitary about what I’m doing. She said she can’t trust me and told me to stop using her foodstuff. I have no history of being unsanitary.

Whenever she’s at my apartment she has to thoroughly inspect every glass she uses and if there is a smudge, or calcium buildup, or any “goo” as she puts it, she has to wash the cup herself or she won’t drink out of it. I’ve asked her to see a therapist about it before but she always says no and suggests that I wash my dishes better, even though I know they’re clean and she’s just insanely picky. 

Anyway, on the weekend it was our anniversary and I picked out a crazy expensive bottle of wine to go with dinner because I know she loves her wine. She came over all done up, looking amazing. We had a wonderful dinner together and she loved the wine. 

Now here’s where the trouble comes. After dinner she asked me if I could go get her another glass of wine. I took her wine glass, went to the kitchen, put it down on the counter, then filled it up and brought it back. 

She immediately asked if I had washed the glass. Which I said no to because why would I need to wash a glass she’s currently using? Then she asked if I got her a new glass, to which I also said no, mentally rolling my eyes at her weird OCD. Then she says she’s asking because her glass had a lipstick mark on it from the red lipstick she was wearing, and if I didn’t wipe it off the glass or get a new one then where did it go?

At this point she goes full Nancy Drew and heads to the kitchen where she finds her empty glass with the lipstick stain sitting on the counter. I guess what happened was that when I put her glass down and turned around to get the bottle of wine, I must have mixed up which glass she was using and poured the wine in a used glass that was sitting on the counter.

Right away she’s saying that she can’t drink out of this glass, that’s disgusting, etc.

I pointed out to her that she’s the only one who uses the wine glasses so it was obviously her own glass from a previous night so it’s really no different than using the other one. She still kept insisting that is was gross and she wouldn’t drink it, so I finally suggested she just pour the wine into the other glass. She also said no to this and insisted she wants fresh wine from the bottle in her proper glass. 

I told her there’s no way I’m pouring her a new glass of wine unless she drinks the one she already has, it’s wasteful and the wine was very expensive, and she needed to get over her phobia as it was ruining the nice night we were having. 

Then she just straight up left. She said if she can’t have a glass of wine the way she likes it here, then she’s going to go home and have one herself at her apartment.

1,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to shave her mustache? | This was with my now ex-girlfriend sometime last year, but I've been talking about it with friends and I'm eager for an honest opinion. Last year, I (M/24) dated this girl (F/24) who was very cute, sweet, nice etc. but very very sheltered. As the title indicates, she had a bit of a mustache; it wasn't Mario stache by any means, but it wasn't just a few lip hairs either. Think of a 7th grade boy going through puberty. I know that sounds harsh and people are going to call me TA just for that, but its the truth. It was that noticeable, even from a meter or so away. 

I saw the potential for a future with her, but the mustache was a pretty big hurdle to overcome; we all have our blemishes (I have acne for instance) but I also do my best to keep it contained and look presentable. Eventually, I was honest with her, telling her that I thought she was beautiful, adorable etc. but that she would look better if she did something with her lip, that lip hair was a personal pet peeve of mine, and that we all make concessions in a relationship. Shave, wax, trim... doesn't matter, just something to make it less painfully obvious. Not a fun subject to broach, but please believe me when I say that I was as gentle as possible when talking about it. She got a little upset at the time, but went through with using a trimmer to cut down the whiskers. Eventually, she stopped trimming and I stopped bringing it up, and sooner or later we ended the relationship for mostly unrelated reasons.

I know I'm a jerk for asking her to shave a mustache, but beyond the selfish reasons, I genuinely was really trying to help her. She wants to get into the business world, and I do not think she will be taken seriously having a dark brown mustache on her lip. I'm not saying its right, it's just how it is. Her parents are very aware of it, and have told her its fine and that she doesn't need to do anything about it. She is no longer in my life, but I sincerely hope she listens for her own sake.

It started as a terrible rash which could only be described as sleeping in a bag of fleas and fire ants. It was hell for around two weeks because doctors had no idea what was happening to me. It was all over my body and I was scratching so bad my skin was opening and bleeding everywhere. Medications werent working. Basically, i was extremely miserable. So after doing my own research I decided to try to cut out gluten. After a week the rash went down and I felt drastically better, not just rash wise but mentally. I finally went to the doctors with my findings and they agreed that it was celiac. Now I cant eat any sort of gluten, not even anything that may have been cross contaminated. 

So I told my husband (21M) and my roommate (21M) that they were allowed to have gluten containing food outside the house and some regular things in the house, like pizza rolls and bread, stuff I dont really eat.

We were all having a good time, just talking about who in the family would be on the apocalypse team, who would be the weak link, etc.

My wife’s sister was making fun of her brother, saying that she wouldn’t want him on her team and he’s useless! And if they were the last people on Earth humanity was obviously done for.

I know this was a mistake, the chat went dead silent, I know I shouldn’t have said it. I apologized immediately and said it was just a joke but I knew it was uncool. I thought that this was enough, I didn’t mean anything harmful by it. 

My wife stormed into the room and started yelling about how much of an idiot I am and how embarrassing I am. She yelled at me for so long, brought up so much stuff and not just this. It went on so long that she took a break to have a snack and take a nap, got up, and started yelling and screaming at me again. I know I made a mistake making the comment but I feel she’s being the asshole too for totally overreacting to the comment.

1,"AITA for telling my husband and his friends that they're not funny and their jokes were disgusting? | Apparently everyone who knows me in real life thinks I overreacted. Looking for some outside opinions.

&#x200B;

So husband and I were over at his parents for Christmas. The day after Christmas he has a tradition of going for a morning hike with his childhood best friends and their respected SOs/wives. In the past, none of their SOs would go  but this year I went along with another one of their gfs. So it was us plus my husband and his 3 other friends.

&#x200B;

During the hike, they started making really crude/vulgar jokes about poop and pee and literally 3rd grade humor stuff. I was tired and sweaty and a bit nauseous and asked them to stop or else I was going to vomit. They did... for a while until they started up again when they thought I couldn't hear but I was only like 10 feet ahead of them. I kind of snapped and told them that they weren't funny and their jokes were lame and immature. They shut up after that but kept snickering, I'm assuming at me. It pissed me off more and I kind of stomped off ahead of them for a while.

&#x200B;

After like 30 min the other girl caught up to me and told me that I should calm down and that my eruption was really embarassing...for me. I don't think she was telling me this in good faith since she seemed fully on the boys' side, but I said fine and let it go. That night my husband and I fought because he told me I was out of line for calling him and his friends immature and pathetic and that if I didn't like their jokes I could've just walked on further ahead. I agree and disagree. Yes I could've put more distance between us BUT the whole point was for us to hike together, not for him and his boys to act like toddlers. I don't think it's a huge ask for people to watch their language when others are around, especially if its making them uncomfortable.

The other three were girls: Haley, Kayla, and Mindy. I’m straight but I don’t have a girlfriend. We picked each other and we’re all pretty much friends by now because we already had several classes together. We had dinner together before heading to Haley’s house to work on the project. Mindy couldn’t make it to the dinner and had to come a bit later. 


While at Haley’s house, we waited for Mindy to come before starting the project. So Haley, Kayla, and I just talked about random stuff. We got to discuss Kayla’s lactose intolerance and how she finds milk to be absolutely disgusting. Right when we were talking about that, Mindy walked through the door. I’m a shy guy and always had a slight crush on Mindy, but I didn’t know how to express that. To be honest, when we were talking about the milk thing, I already thought about Mindy because she has big boobs and fit women with big boobs makes me think of milk lol. 


I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to loudly say the meme “milk truk just arrive” when Mindy walked in, but that’s what I did and didn’t think much of it immediately after I said it. I thought it was humorous and would make Mindy notice my smoldering sense of humor. However, I faced a tough crowd. Mindy asked me what I said. I said it was just a dumb meme from years ago. She asked me what it meant. I didn’t want to make it any more awkward, so I said it’s pretty self-explanatory. 


Haley said that was an extremely weird thing to say. Kayla said ditto to that. I said that I thought they would find it funny. Haley said she didn’t find that funny at all. Kayla said ditto to that again. I said that we should get cracking on the project. Mindy asked me if the joke was directed at her boobs. I said she already knew the answer to that and let’s not waste any more time since it’s already late. Mindy said she didn’t feel comfortable working with me anymore. I told her to stop being a drama queen and I apologized for making the dumb joke around girls. 


Mindy asked Haley if she could borrow a jacket to prevent me from ogling her. Haley said sure and went to her room to grab one. I told Mindy to stop making it awkward for me. She said I made it awkward for everyone. Alright, I was a quite sad the girl I had a little crush on turned sour on me. We worked on the project for four hours and called it a night.

0,"AITA for yelling at my stepmother? | This happened a few months back, I just wanted to get the opinion of others on this matter since I still think about this moment quite a lot.

Some backstory: in 2016 my brother passed away because of a stomach sickness. Ever since then, we’ve laid his ashes to rest in the cemetery of our hometown. My biological mother adorned the grave with little fences, plants, pretty gravel and such. It looks darling, and it makes her feel good to have something to keep neat as she visits.

My stepmother this she's spiritual. She claims she can commune with spirits, though only does this when she’s drunk. Sometimes, she brought up my brother, which I personally doubt since my brother did not like her at all.

Cut to a few months into me living with my father and my stepmother. In the weekends, they would go out and come back drunk. Sometimes, they’d argue with one another, getting pretty loud when it was around 1am already. I had gotten used to this behaviour to a certain degree and usually tried to sleep through it. This night, however, they were being particularly loud.

When I woke up, I heard my father telling my stepmother that she had no business at ‘his grave’. Still being groggy, I opened my door (first floor, they were on ground level) to listen in on their fight. The fight proceeded with my stepmother lecturing my father about what he does at my brother’s grave, which was supposedly reminisce about the past, and how it would keep his spirit here. My father told her that even if that was the case, she had no business with touching his grave.

I listened in for a bit more and heard more about my stepmother telling my father for only thinking about the past with my brother and not ‘telling him’ about the future. And because she felt like my mother has ‘trapped his spirit’ by putting the little fences around his grave, she removed them and threw them away.

This is when I snapped. What manner of thinking allows her to mess with the grave of my brother, who didn’t even like her to begin with? I did not go to directly confront her, but I yelled at her as loud as I could from the first floor, how she was to disrespect and chastise our family, my brother, like that. 

I slammed my door shut. Immediately, everything went quiet. Shortly afterwards, my stepmother went into the car and drove off. It wasn’t until two weeks after that we were on speaking terms again. According to my father, my outrage had hurt her quite a bit. I told him that I like there is a certain line you can’t step over, no matter intentions.

Even if she thought that the decorations she assumed were ‘trapping the spirit of my brother’, the least she could have done was to bring her concerns up with both my father and my mother, who have the most right to worry over his grave. Yet, in a drunken fit, she simply drove up there, took the fences away and drove off again.

0,"AITA for being embarrassed my boyfriend called out a wedding party at a 9/11 memorial? | So off the bat, I agree with his sentiments but disagree on the way he handled it. My SO and I, along with my sister and her SO, were out for my birthday, walking around a park.  At this park there’s a large 9/11 memorial that lists all the names of the people who died and has a somber feel to it, however it’s also in a sunny spot in a beautiful public park.

My SO mentioned how some people have started taking their wedding photos in front of the memorial, and how it’s becoming an issue because it’s disrespectful; people have posted wedding photos at the memorial with all the names photoshopped out. My sister and her SO agreed and noted that the memorial in their city also has lots of people taking silly selfies and stuff that’s not appropriate for what it is.As we walked back, we noticed a wedding party (including the bride in her wedding dress, groom, kids, parents, the full party) in front of the memorial, taking photos. We couldn't walk through the memorial because of the photo-taking, so we went around. 

As we were about to come up on them, my sister’s SO and mine started joking (so we thought) about confronting the party or making them feel bad for using the site. My sister and both begged them not to, but in a slightly joking tone (we were laughing and smiling) because we didn't think they were serious. Then as we passed, my sister’s SO stayed quiet but mine went up to them and yelled out “It’s a 9/11 memorial, you shouldn’t be taking those pictures here!” or something along those lines. I couldn’t remember clearly  as I felt so embarrassed and kept walking. He didn’t linger or confront anyone directly, and by the time I glanced back he was already walking away from them.  I’m not sure how much the wedding party understood what was going on, but they definitely looked confused/concerned momentarily and stared at us as we passed. Luckily there was no further confrontation. My sister and I basically power walked away from them.

Afterwards, my sister and I basically felt it was rude and didn’t accomplish anything besides put a damper on someone’s special day, but my SO disagreed and seemed happy with what he did (and my sister’s SO agreed with him). I’ve never been embarrassed like that at something my SO’s done and I feel kind of bad I wasn’t able to be supportive - instead I just disagreed with him while not even directly facing him and then abruptly stopped talking about it. So, was my boyfriend rude, or did he do the right thing and I should support it? Did the wedding party deserve to be berated or are they free to take pictures wherever?

However, my girlfriend objected citing her belief that it would be disrespectful for me to pee on this sacred building. I respected her wishes and found a large tree to do my business instead.
Afterwards, she told me she couldn't believe I would even consider doing something so disrespectful because many people (her included) see it as desecration. I conceded that I definitely would not do this with other people around, or with her in my presence because she feels strongly about the sanctity of the church, but if I were alone I would have no qualms about taking a leak on a pile of bricks, especially since it would have no impact on anybody in any way. She maintained that it is disrespectful to do regardless, even if nobody is watching and at that point we just agreed to disagree, but she said that she thinks I'm closed minded now, and she sees me in a slightly more negative light because of this conversation.

So it happened that it became my turn to provide food for our group of five. I decided to make a quiche, and instead of the beef, as the recipe suggested, I just used mealworms. My friends came over and had dinner with me, and enjoyed the evening and the food I had prepared. Neither of them seemed to notice something out of the ordinary or commented on any of the individual components of my quiche. 

Important notice: I did not pretend that the quiche contained beef/pork/chicken/whatever -- actually, I didn´t comment on the ""meat"" at all. Maybe it is also vital to know that I had never prepared a quiche for my friends before, so it is not like they expected it to contain conventional meat when they ate it. If one of them had asked about it, I would have absolutely told them. Also, I know that none of them has an allergy against mealworms.

We usually have a great relationship but recently we've been at each other's throats over this. I can't tell if this is a real problem or if it's just because we're cooped up.

The problem is that I eat a lot of foods my boyfriend considers gross. Some of these are foods everybody considers gross, and others are things just he does. 

Things he thinks are gross: melted cheese, shredded cheese, hummus, chickpeas, fries in milkshakes, this Indian yogurt I eat, and peanut butter with nothing else.

Things probably everyone thinks are gross: pickles in milkshakes, ketchup in rice, capers and their juice, and mangoes and cheese. There are probably others I'm forgetting.

For some context, our bedroom window faces directly out onto the communal yard of our flatblock, with the back door to the building being right next to our window at a right-angle.

We were both chilling in our room, I was laying on the bed in a t-shirt and knickers, when we heard a knock at our window. Our blind was closed, but we assumed it was someone trying to get into the building so we ignored it, but they knocked a couple more times until my husband suddenly, to my shock and embarresmet, lifted the blind up to talk to whoever it was.

As we'd expected it was some man we didn't know asking for us to let him in.

I Was shocked and embarrassed, because as I said, was lying there with no pants on, and now there's some strange guys face peering in through the window, only about 4 metres tops away from me.

As my husband lifted the blind I tried to tell him not to, and was able to quickly pull the duvet over myself. I Hope I did it in time that the man didn't see anything, but even with the duvet covering me I still felt kinda vulnerable and embarrassed to have a stranger staring in at me in my bedroom like this. It's a pretty small room with a proportionately large window, (The window takes up just over half th wall space) so I felt a bit like a goldfish on display.

My husband had a short exchange with the guy of about 20-30 seconds, throughout which I was whispering through clenched teeth for him to close the blind. When he was finally done and the man had gone I started asking, 'Why did you do that?' At which point he suddenly burst into anger at me, and started ranting in an almost yell, asking why I have to always over-react/
Throw a fuss about things that don't matter (I Can't recall his exact wording)

At this point I felt a bit guilty and started questioning myself. I Am a very private, easily embarrassed, and somewhat prudish person. I Wonder if maybe this wssn't something I should've felt embarrassed or gotton annoyed about.

Now I look back, I wonder if it's really as bad as a thought in the moment. For one, I was able to lift the duvet over myself in time so I was covered, plus I was positioned behind my husband in a way that the man may not have even had a clear view of me, and also my husband was aswell himself just in a t-shirt and boxers, so was in the same postion as I was and if anything was exposing himself  even more than he was me.

They are extremely close, talk everyday, video chat every weekend etc. It was her moms birthday a few weeks ago and as a surprise, she flew her mom up here and had her stay with us a couple of days. We all hung out and had a wonderful time; I really get along well with my MIL and it's great. On the last night of my wife's mom being here before her flight in the morning, as we were getting ready for bed, I notice my wife gathering a bunch of blankets and pillows. I ask her what she's doing and she said ""oh I'm gonna sleep with my mom tonight"". I'll admit I didn't react well because that concept is so weird to me. My family and I are not close at all, my sister and mom have never slept in the same bed, and I find it weird that a woman in her 30s wants to sleep in the same bed as a woman in her 50s. It's...creepy to me. I told her so, and said it icked me out. She got pissed and told me to stop being gross, and that I can fuck off because she is going to hang out with her mom before she leaves. We got kinda heated, and she stomped off to go spend the night with her mom IN THE SAME BED. The next day, she is still pretty annoyed with me and told me that I'm making a sweet thing so disgusting and weird. I don't feel that I'm wrong, I think it's creepy. She thinks it's normal.

1,"AITA for advising my wife to wear less revealing clothing when my son’s friends are over? | My wife is 48, we have been married for nearly 20 years. We have a 18 year old son, as well as 4 younger kids.

Our son is in his last year of high school. He is a very popular guy and has many friends. His friends often come over to hang out and occasionally to sleep over. Our house is large so they like coming here. 

Last year, my son’s best friend Tom (also 18) came with us on a family vacation at our beach house. During that time I noticed that he would always be staring at my wife and checking her out. Once, he walked in on her changing in a bathroom, and claimed that he “didnt know it was occupied”. He would also say borderline inappropriate comments like “you look lovely today” and “you have to tell me your workout routine”. For this reason I am a bit wary of Tom, in particular.

On Saturday, my son and his 4 friends,including Tom, were over at our house for a sleepover. In the morning, my wife made them breakfast. She was wearing only a silk camisole and shorts. I walked in and noticed that many of the guys were not so subtly “checking her out”. Don’t get me wrong, my wife looks amazing for her age, but it just seemed uncomfortable and awkward for her to be dressed like that in front of her son’s friends.

After breakfast, I mentioned this to her, and told her that she should consider wearing something less revealing next time, or simply just get dressed in her everyday clothes. She said its “no big deal” and that I’m being too overbearing, that “they’re just kids”. I said they’re not just kids, they’re young men, and I’m just looking out for her. Besides, I told her that our son would no doubt agree with me, that he’d prefer it if his friends didn’t check out his mother.

0,"WIBTA to tell my MIL to stop giving tithings in my daughter’s name, and not read or buy her religious books and items? | Okay so my MIL is a Christian. I was raised Christian, but left the religion once I was older and honestly don’t think I ever believed in it anyway. If I’m being honest, I’ve got some trauma due to being raised in the religion, and have a slight dislike/disdain for it, but I don’t bash others for believing. You do you boo boo, idc. My mil also knows I’m not religious, neither is her son (my husband), and nor will we be raising our daughter religiously. We’re of the mindset that once she’s old enough to understand and want to learn about a religion of her choosing, we’ll support her in that endeavor, whatever the religion may be. Having said that, it’s recently come to my attention that when we’d drop DD(9mo) off with MIL, she’s been taking her to church. Honestly, I wasn’t a fan of it, but I figured she’s young, so it’s not like she understands anything/is having anything imposed on her, so whatever, I guess. Plus I understand my MIL truly loves her religion and her grand daughter, so I’m not going to make a fuss and make her have to choose between her god and her grandchild. But *then* I found out my MIL has been buying and reading her religious children’s material, like a my first bible, having her watch Veggie Tales, buying her clothes that say “god loves me” etc. I also found out that she’d been taking away the $1 bills her uncles would give her, and give them to her church in tithing envelopes with DDs name on it, and have her drop it in the bucket. I do NOT like this, and want to tell her so. She knows our plans as far as our daughters upbringing and our own values and something about the situation just feels gross to me. My husband, on the other hand, thinks it’s nbd and I should leave it alone, bc it’s just her trying to bond with her and it’s not like DD knows what’s going on or is old enough to have anything ingrained in her.

So, long story short, I am pro-life. 

When we learned that she was pregnant(around two weeks ago), I immediately resolved to be there for her and support her through every stage of the pregnancy. 

Then, two weeks later, she tells me she wants an abortion, because she doesn't want the responsibility of having a child in her life just yet.

As it goes against my beliefs, I don't want her to have an abortion. But, I want to respect my girlfriend's right to choose. 

I want to propose an ultimatum. The abortion or me. I am willing and wanting to sacrifice everything for this child, but if she isn't willing, then I don't want to impede her.

1,"AITA for telling my OCD friend to “get over it”? | As the title says, I have a friend who has OCD. When out in public she never forces anyone to follow her rules, but her house is another story.

Whenever I go over to her house, I always see rule pages all OVER the place. Specifically on every door leading into another room. These rules are in place to prevent her from having an ‘OCD attack’. She’s said they’re not just for others to follow, but just as a reminder to herself. It’s ridiculous. 

These rules are like; don’t sit down anywhere without telling where. Wash your hands after coming inside. Wash your hands after eating before touching anything. Don’t sit down anywhere without permission, etc etc. It’s really annoying.

Of course I always tend to forget about the rule pages around, I’m used to them there so I pay no mind. Because of this I had forgotten some of the rules, and sat down on the couch (which had her clean laundry on it so I just moved it to the side)  while she was in the bathroom.

Needless to say, she was panicked when she saw. Apparently she didn’t know if my hands were safe or not, and since I had moved her laundry it is now “infected” and “unsafe” which gave her a TOTAL breakdown.

She started crying, asking me why I would do such a horrible thing. I find her behaviour absolutely ridiculous, overdramatic, so I tell her to just get over it! This pissed her off even more. She told me to please leave and that I was an asshole because she can’t help it.

1,"WIBTA if I told my friend that her attire is inappropriate? | My friend is turning 29 this year, and just got married. I've never been one to judge her (or anyone) based on her appearance, but recently I've started to notice that she cares less and less about the way she dresses. 

&#x200B;

For example, we used to be roommates before she married... and when I would have people over she would walk around in barely there boy shorts, and a silk spaghetti strap top... no bra. Now, in private, I had no issue with this as everyone is allowed their freedom at home, but my parents noticed that she would wear no bra... and would bring it up in conversation sometimes. They even dubbed her ""low hanger"". She's a busty girl.

&#x200B;

Today,  she sends me  pictures of her honeymoon where she went to a safari and fed animals... her entire top of her bra is spilling out of her top.

&#x200B;

I understand that women sometimes like to show off their bodies... but tbqh she's on the heavier side... so it just looks plain bad. I have a feeling she might be completely unaware of how ""out of place"" it looks. The only reason why I want to make her aware of this is bc she's having a tough time finding employment, and people often judge her for her appearance (I've had people, one of them being an ex-boss whom I recommended her for the job to, flat out tell me that she dresses like a hooker).

For some background, we have been married for 6 years and have a six month old baby. We have a great marriage but my wife is particular when it comes to cleanliness to say the least (she cleans the tracks on the sliding glass door with a vinegar soaked qtip once a month as an example). To me: eh, the dishes will done, wearing underwear twice and clothes a few times is not a big deal and maybe those beer bottles will throw themselves away (I'm kidding but I've heard ""Aaron those beer bottles aren't going to walk themselves to the recycling bin!""  many times). 

She made plans to take our son to visit her family over 4th of July and the about a week before and after. I couldn't get off work (cop) so I decided to stay here. It took me about less than 6 hours to ""trash"" the house. Or at least what my wife would consider trashed but it really was just fast food wrappers and beer bottles. But of course over the weeks it got worse and worse because laundry and more trash  and dog hair got added to the pile. I didn't mind it one bit but I did make a plan to make sure the day before she came home I would basically get out the push broom and snow shovel and throw everything away. 

Well she decided to come home a day early to surprise me while I was on shift. I have never, ever seen her this mad at me. She is beyond furious and I've heard asshole among many other things.  It truly didn't help that one of the dogs brought a scorpion in clinging to his fur so my wife is blaming that on the mess too. 

To me, I should have the absolute right to keep the house however I like if I'm only affecting myself. I don't mind the mess, maybe after our house being so sterile all the time, I actually kind of enjoyed the mess a bit. To her, the house has to be clean and sanitized at all times for our health, cleanliness and image. She is mortified at the thought that one of her friends might have popped over and seen the mess.

TL:DR- I was about to have 2nd oophorectomy (removal of ovary) on Fri but on Mon I found out I’m pregnant. Turns out the father is married. Wants me to have an abortion. AITA if I don’t?                         


The background is I (32f) met this man (33m)after I moved back to my home town when I left my abusive husband. We have been dating for 6 months.   

This man was charming and persistent. I told him I wasn’t ready for a relationship bc my marriage was so damaging but he swore up and down that I would never feel like that again and he would always be there for me. We spent weekend trips together, every night we are together. When we met he said he had a roommate who didn’t allow guests. Then that roommate suddenly wasn’t paying rent and he (bf) couldn’t pay his ex’s rent and his so he “had no choice” but to move her in. After that when she wasn’t home I was allowed to come over to his house. They had separate rooms, I believed that it was just temporary in order to save money. His lease is up in Aug, we were talking about moving in.  

Last month my period was 5d late. I told him I didn’t know what I would do, I would probably want an abortion. He told me he would never want that, we would make it work and he loves me. As I was waiting for the results I was sick thinking about an abortion. How could I do that? Thankfully the test was negative. My period was late due to a large cyst that was discovered shortly after.   

My surgery to remove the cyst is scheduled. He’s promised to be here every day to help me with my son. I found out I am pregnant on Mon. He said he was happy, excited. The next day he told me I had to have an abortion. This is where the sh*t hits the fan. I told my sister about what was going on and she decided to do the truth finder search. Turns out they are married. And a few other lies he told me were discovered from the same search.   

I drove to his house knowing she was home and he was asleep. I talked to her, she was shocked. We confronted him together. We’re both leaving him. I was devastated to hear they were taking my remaining ovary. I want this baby. I can’t fathom terminating. He has a 3 year old and a 9 month old with her. He told me he wasn’t sure the infant was even his...obviously he is.   

He says I’m having the baby out of spite. That I shouldn’t have the baby because I hate him. I’m forcing him to have a baby he doesn’t want. It’s so confusing because all he did was talk to me about how sad he was that the test last month was neg & how he would have taken care of me, he said he was sad about that bc he wanted kids with me. This baby is a miracle.

Warning: this post may be gross.

 I'm a licensed massage therapist. I currently work at a spa, and I pay ""rent"" for my massage room.  Before treatment I ask what areas they want focus on. This client,(F30s?), expressed she was having some pain in her lower back and glute(butt) muscles.
I leave the room, and and I told her to dress down to her comfort level.

This client booked for 1 hour massage. About 15 minutes into the massage, I tell her that I'm going to pull back the sheet and start work on her lower back.

Now the gross part. The client wasn't wearing underwear, and when I pulled back the sheet there was brown liquid mush around her butt crack. This wasnt just a skid mark or not wiping very well, but the sheet now had what appeared to be poop on it. Runny yet sticky at the same time. The sheet was gross.

I've never been in this situation before, and I didn't want to embarrass her. I couldn't continue the massage, it would be a health hazard and it was smeared all over the sheet and some of her lower back. I said to her oh I'm really sorry I think you might need to go to the washroom and clean up a little. I'll give you a few minutes and let me know when you're ready. I left the room and heard her go into the washroom. 15 minutes have gone by and she hasn't come back out, so I knock on the door and ask if she's okay. She responded Yes I'll be out in a minute. But that minute turned into another 15 minutes, so she was in there for a half hour! She came back out and I continued for 15 mins. When I finished, I left the room for her to get dressed and met her up at the counter to pay.

This where I'm wondering if IATA. I charged her the full amount for the massage, because she books the one hour time slot, and I had another client after her so I couldn't exactly run late. She got really mad saying she should pay half the price! I explain that I was sorry, but the hour was booked for her and it would be the same if somebody was late, they would still have to pay the full price of the time slot that they booked. She started yelling at me at the front desk saying how unprofessional I was. She eventually did pay, and later that day there was a review that she posted saying how I ripped her off and charged her more money than the actual massage.
My partner said that I should have given the poor girl a break, she obviously was ill and I should have charged her half of the amount even if it meant I was losing money.

Can you not get dressed? It’s 5pm.” I told her it was warm in the house. And she said sure but not THAT warm. I told her I was free to walk around the house however I wanted and it was none of her business. She said it was her business because it’s weird and she can tell I need to shower. I told her she was fucking rude and went back to my room. When I came up later for dinner, my mom said my sister had a point and I should at least put some shorts and socks on.

A few weeks ago a mutual friend who I don’t know really well hosted a dinner party and invited me and a couple of our mutual friends. I’m just going to throw it out there but I don’t eat vegetables, yes I’m an adult. I’ve never liked them and growing up my parents never forced me to eat any so I never developed the appetite. 

Fast forward to the dinner party we are all at the table enjoying the meal and I am eating around the vegetables and admiring my hosts garden and she tells me that she grows all her own vegetables and I tell her how cool that is and she looks me in my eyes and says the following “I use my bath water to water the plants” and then she giggles. Everyone at the table look uncomfortable and I asked her if she was joking and she looked puzzled and said no and went on a little rant about not wasting water. Anyway to cut a long story short I called her disgusting and that I didn’t appreciate being fed her bath water veggies (okay I didn’t eat it but she put them on my plate) and that she’s a unhygienic inconsiderate person and that she can’t be trusted to prepare food for people and then I walked out

Whenever he meets any couple he then talks behind their backs about how he bets he could bang that guy's girlfriend and make him watch because he's so ""alpha."" I also know from other friends that he's had that same conversation with them about my GF and I. I'm not exaggerating at all, he actually finds a way to make this weird cuckoldry thing a topic of conversation every time I see him and with everyone else he hangs out with. I've never seen anything like it

We're all in university and he mentioned asking on the university subreddit if anyone wanted to hang out one night when we were all drunk. I wake up the next morning hungover and browsing the sub and then see a post matching his description of his post the night before. I click on it and see people in the comments calling him a weirdo for his post history, so naturally I looked and what I found was just too fucking good I honestly started laughing out loud reading through his post history. He claims to have cucked people before in conversation, but his reddit post history is full of nothing but him asking for bulls to come plow his gf (now ex gf) over months and him making fantasy posts (hopefully) about being cucked in weird subreddits. 


Everyone is pretty weirded out by him constantly bringing up wanting to cuck people and I think this is just too poetic to not share with a few close friends. If I found out he was into this shit just through his post on the college subreddit I would not share with anyone, but this guy makes him being ""the bull"" such a huge part of his public persona that I find it really hard to sit through him talking about this knowing the truth.

1,"AITA for telling my SIL that fed is not best. | 

I’m an avid breastfeeder. I’m been breastfeeding my son for 6 months. My goal is 2 years. We had a little trouble In the beginning but we overcame the issues. I tried so hard because I firmly believe that Breast is best. That doesn’t mean I think formula feeding moms are less I just believe breastmilk is better for baby because it’s specifically made for baby.

I’ve never really had any issues with anyone making rude remarks about me breastfeeding and my in-laws have all been very supportive except for my SIL T. She’s never said anything but she will roll her eyes or walk away while I’m feeding. T has a daughter a month younger than my son and she formula feeds. She said she wasn’t able to breastfeed because she didn’t make enough but she only tried for about week and then started formula feeding. I don’t think she gave it enough time but I have never said that to her because I know it can be a touchy subject.

The other day we were at my in-laws house. My MIL was feeding T’s daughter a bottle whole I was feeding my son the boob. T made a remark that she thought her mother would really like to be able to feed my son but since I didn’t pump she wouldn’t have that opportunity. She was making remarks about how formula gave other people a chance to bond with the baby. I said there were plenty of other opportunities for my MIL and other people to bond with baby that doesn’t involve feeding and right now I’m providing him with what he needs. 

I don’t think she liked that answer because she said “well fed is best.” I said to her that I have no problem with formula but fed is not best. Breast is. At this point she just lost it and told me how I was being inconsiderate of her feelings because she couldn’t breastfeed so that means she isn’t providing her baby with what’s best so she must be a terrible mother. 
I never said anything of that nature. I was just stating that breastmilk is better. Science even says so.

1,"AITA for breaking up with girlfriend for getting plastic surgery? | This happened 2 weeks ago, but I just discovered this sub.

I was with my girlfriend for 6 months and everything was great.  We didn't fight much since it was pretty early on into the relationship, and I'm not really a contentious guy.  Then, she told me that she got plastic surgery...  We're both Korean and Koreans are known for their plastic surgery.  I've always been completely against any type of procedure that changes your appearance.  Her surgery wasn't anything major, it was just double eyelid surgery.  For those not in the know, double eyelid surgery is very popular, especially for asians.  I'm not sure about the numbers, but I'm pretty sure a large amount of asians do get them and they're not really seen as a big deal.  However, to me it is.  I became distant with her and could not get rid of the negative thoughts that started to form in my head.

The part that really bothered me was the fact that she would spend money to change her appearance, albeit slightly, because she wasn't satisfied with the way she looks.  I know some might say what's the difference between that and makeup, but just the idea of permanently changing your appearance does not sit well with me.

So I decided to end the relationship with her.  I met with her and ended the relationship but I did not tell her the reason was because of her surgery.  I just assumed that it might be best not to tell her because she might start to hate herself for getting the surgery or become self conscious about her appearance.  I was really flustered and just told her it's because of personal reasons and did not get into details at all.

She texted me a few times throughout the week asking me what the problem was and what she did wrong, but I just kept telling her I didn't wanna talk about it and eventually ignored her (or responded very late) to her messages.  We live in the same town and whenever I see her friends, they all try to ignore me now.  I'm sure they all think i'm an asshole.

1,"AITA for making fun of my girlfriend during her worst menstrual cycle? |   

The events of mentioned in this post took place yesterday; however, my girlfriend still isn’t conversing with me.

I have been with my girlfriend for about 4 years now, and we have been on several vacations and dates, as any other couple would do so. With her moving in, we are having a blast and we’re making the best of quarantine together to make memories. Prior to such transition, the talks of moving in had been on the table; nonetheless, we preferred to nurture our relationship before making a decision.

She comes from a wealthy family, and she has a French background that makes her inclined towards a “proper lady” persona. Naturally, she was taught to use cutlery from a fairly young age, and I have learned a couple of table manners, all thanks to her. I think it’s wonderful to know how to use knife and fork to relish a meal, she hasn’t steered from her ways—even when she lets loose while she is drunk or partying. 

Anyway, my girlfriend’s cycle is sort of out of loop. She normally doesn’t experience cramps but when she does, she stays in bed all day, going as far as taking a day off from her work. As a result, she starts demanding for chocolates (strictly gourmet, not the cheap ones), hot chocolate drinks, junk food. 

While she is at it, she sorts of steer away from her proper lady persona and succumbs to munching on edibles. It’s extremely unlikely of her to engage in such activities but, whatever makes her happy and relaxed. 

She started with her periods yesterday and was unable to move from our bed. I volunteered to prepare a mix of fruits, oats, and yogurt for her, which is something that she really enjoys. Unable to move her arm and back, I had to help her sit down, straighten her back, and put thermal cushions behind her lower back to help ease the pain. She was demanding for an ibuprofen to help with the cramps but, I urged that she shouldn’t take a pill with an empty stomach. 

As soon as she lifted the spoon to feed herself, she dropped some of the edibles on her plush blanket that she was seeking comfort in. I had never seen her in such improper state, so I resorted to laughing to express my hilarity of the situation. Yogurt was dripping from her mouth, and she dropped a blueberry or two on the blanket and top. 

I shouldn’t have laughed at her situation but, I couldn’t help it—since I had never seen her in such improper state, as she is so perfect and sophisticated at all times. I thought it was a comical moment that I should have recorded. I saw tears brimming in her eyes, and she demanded me to get out of our bedroom, which I retorted, obviously. 

I discussed the matter with my close friends, and they called me a moronic asshole for making fun for her in such vulnerable state. I don’t think that I was in the wrong to laugh at her.

They do not clean up after themselves and they completely neglect things like dishes, cleaning up after parties, etc. It's only for the semester that I live here, thank the lord.

Recently, I was in the shower and I notice a used tampon on the side of the shower. It's totally bloody and engorged from the shower water, and the blood is dripping down into the shower. Gross.

So, after getting out of the shower I realize no one is home. I thought a lot about how I want to address it, and I decided to text this exactly in the house group chat: ""Hi, someone left something in the shower. They should clean it up as soon as possible.""

Fast forward to later, people had presumably come home and whoever it was took care of it. 

The next day, one of the girls asked to talk to me. She basically told me that all 3 of them had separately looked in the shower trying to figure out if it was them that 'left something,' and that, through process of elimination, it was figured out who the culprit was. She kind of condescendingly told me that she understands where I was coming from but that I really embarrassed the girl that did it (even though I still don't know who did it, I suppose it's now a secret between them). In return, I told her that my intention was not to embarrass anyone, that it was unsanitary, and if she was suggesting I clean it up instead. She told me she's not quite suggesting that but that I really shouldn't have addressed everyone about it.

I didn't apologize and told her that I did what I thought was appropriate. However, I'm now wondering if I was in the wrong for how I handled it. I asked my mother and she said I should have just cleaned it up, but my mom has relatively poor judgment and will avoid confrontation at all costs.

At the end of the road is a small local parish church.

When I'm training intervals I usually jog the 1km to the road to warm up, stop and do some dynamic stretching, and then start my intervals (normally 400 or 800m long). In-between intervals I have short recovery sessions, where I'll sometimes jog slowly, walk, or stretch.

The other day I was doing some stretching between reps on the bench at the end of the road, which is opposite the church.

I apologised and moved onto another street to finish my intervals and stretching, but it wasn't really an ideal place to do speed sets because it's a lot busier and I often end up having to stop for cars during the intervals.

One of my good female friends, who always calls me out on my bs, smacked the side of my arm and said it was gross how men stare at women when they walk by and that women aren’t pieces of meat. 

I was pretty tipsy by this point and I said that “If she didn’t want people to stare at her like that then why would she wear that outfit? I mean isn’t that the point? If she didn’t want to be stared at then maybe she should wear something else.”

My friend got super pissed at me and said that she thought that “I was better than that” and that I was victim blaming. She said that some women wear those clothes to make themselves feel better and not to get attention. 

I tried to explain that I wasn’t victim blaming at all but why else would she dress like that besides wanting people to look at her? And even if she was dressing like that to feel good about herself, she should still expect people to look. 

We went back and forth like this for a while before I had to go to the bathroom and it didn’t come up again that night. 

My friend is still pissed at me (in a more light hearted way though) and she says that I need to “change my perspective”. 

I really do get some of what she’s saying but I also think that I’m not entirely out of line on this. 

So AITA for staring and saying that she should wear something different if she doesn’t want to get looked at?",False,False,3,2,1,1,4,3,Purity
0,"AITA for requesting my roommate that her daughter use the downstairs bathroom? | So I've lived with my roommate for over a year now, we are very similar and the house was great until her daughter (18f) moved in a couple months ago. Her daughter has very poor hygiene which has caused quite a bit of discomfort for me since I have normal human expectations for cleanliness and she has none.

We have two full bathrooms but the one upstairs is significantly nicer because I updated it when we moved in. Her daughter likes to use the upstairs bathroom but she does not clean up after herself. She leaves fecal matter on the toilet seat, hair covering the tub every time she shaves and throws her clothing in the middle of the floor after she changes. Not to mention she's always sick; she had hand foot and mouth disease, a stomach bug and the flu all within the last month. I'm convinced this is because she doesn't have good hygiene and I'm paranoid I'm going to catch something from her despite my overly cautious frequent sanitizing of the area.

I (26f) want her to use the downstairs bathroom as I'm tired of feeling like I need to wear a hazmat suit in my own living area. Her mother (43f) wants to believe her child can do no wrong and refuses to have a hygiene talk with her.

AITA if I demand she stops using the upstairs bathroom ?  I may request that her mother pay a larger portion of the rent if they don't agree. We're still splitting it two ways even though she now has an extra person living with us. ",False,False,4,3,2,2,5,3,Purity
0,"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend's father to stay with us? | My boyfriend (26m) and I (24f) have been together a year and moved in together a couple months ago. His sister (23f) also lives with us but her moving out has been delayed slightly due to extenuating circumstances.

When I met their dad (55m) he hit on me. Repeatedly. I dismissed it at first as just his sense of humour or me reading too much into it and tried to laugh it off, but he made some really obvious jokes/innuendo and touched my arm/leg/small of my back when he really had no need to do so. It was after he left that the siblings confirmed that he was flirting with me, which... no. No thank you. Ew. I wasn't angry/upset but I was a bit weirded out, joked about it, and then we all moved on.

He and his dad had a phone call earlier. My boyfriend mentioned his cousin (the dad's niece) getting married this autumn. She's pushed all her planned wedding celebrations over the next 6+ months back into the final week, so she's got a hen/stag, 2 brunches, a bridal shower, rehearsals, the actual wedding, and some other stuff all happening over 5 days in mid October.

His dad wants to stay with us as at this point in time his sister will have moved out and her room will be a guest room. I do not want his dad staying with us due to the one time I met him. My boyfriend says that as I was able to laugh it off it shouldn't be a big deal but I'm just not entirely comfortable with it.

1,"AITA for feeding my friends crickets? | For a little context: my group of friends is pretty tight knit and have known each other forever. All of us share a common love of cooking, grow food in our gardens, brew our own beer/kombucha, and like to experiment with ingredients. 

One of my friends recently hosted an end of summer potluck and all of the usual suspects were there. Everyone made something and most people’s dishes included something they had grown themselves or was a new dish they were experimenting with. My partner and I made some granola bars that used berries from our garden, whole nuts, homemade granola, etc... they looked like normal granola bars. But one of the ingredients that was “invisible” was cricket flower that we used for additional protein and binder for all the other ingredients. It’s important to note that cricket flower is literally just dehydrated crickets that have been ground into a fine powder, so it would be impossible to know what it was just by looking at it. 

We put them out on the table with everyone else’s stuff, and later in the day someone asked who brought the bars bc they liked them. We got talking about how we made them, which is pretty common conversation with this group, and I mentioned that one of the ingredients was cricket flower and he made a huge deal about it, saying how gross it is and that is was messed up that I would feed people bugs without telling them what it was. A lot of the other people at the party were pretty grossed out by it too, even tho many of them had already eaten and enjoyed them. I know everyone that was there fairly well and I know their dietary restrictions seeing as we cook for each other all the time. 

I feel bad bc yeah, it is an unusual ingredient and some people might find it gross, but I wouldn’t have mentioned anything ahead of time if I had used some other unusual seed or spice (and neither would anyone else in this group). I guess bc this was an insect a lot of people are telling me that it’s different and I should have told everyone ahead of time what was in the bars.

Anyway she didn’t wanna eat after that and just layed back in bed. I was supposed to take the trash out today but vomit is disgusting honestly so I asked if she can take care of it today. It’s her mess anyway but she just got upset with me and for the past hour 1/2 she has been laying in bed moping and acting like she’s all miserably in pain. I cant go near that trash without gagging and she won’t get out of bed so I guess she’s just gonna let the vomit trash sit there? AITA?",False,False,2,3,1,1,4,3,Purity
1,"AITA for telling my friend he should get a boyfriend closer to his looks match? | Okay I know I sound like a dick but hear me out.

My friend has a boyfriend whos a lot, lets just say less attractive than him.

My friend is always shaven cleanly and puts a lot of work into looking cute.

He has a flat stomach, and long curly hair that he takes care of.

But his boyfriend however, hes fat, and has hair in all the spots he shouldnt, and all the spots he should hes missing it.

My friend says they are dating because they are both into computers and nerd stuff, but still.

His boyfriend is like a 3/10, and hes a 9/10, he should try to date someone on his level.

0,"AITA for leading the prayer in class despite being openly atheist? | I am 25F, grad student. For this story, it is important to disclose that my country is predominantly Roman Catholic, the grad school I currently attend is Catholic, but I am openly atheist and have been one since I was 11 years old. 

Earlier today was my first meeting for this subject, the heaviest major units wise for the semester. My professor (70M, religious, is known to have opening and closing prayer every period) made eye contact with me and asked me to lead the opening prayer. Despite being an atheist, I led the prayer and said a safe Our Father (I memorize the prayers because I studied in Catholic schools and my family is Catholic)

The reason why I did this was because I didn’t want to risk a possible negative reaction, interrogation, or debate with my professor which could ruin his impression of the class. You know how some old religious people view atheism as subversive and wrong especially in a predominantly Catholic country like mine. I wasn’t forced to lead the prayer, but I just sucked it up and did it anyway since I felt that reciting an opening prayer for one minute outweighed the possible consequences to the class if my professor reacted negatively to me declining to lead the prayer due to my atheism.

A few hours after, one of my classmates calls me out and says that they felt offended at what I did because I knowingly disrespected the Catholic faith by reducing solemn and holy prayers into a meaningless vocalization. They say that prayers should always be said with meaning and that I shouldn’t have led the prayer when I am not a spiritual person ans don’t even believe in God. They say that only Catholics should lead the prayer as a respect for the faith.

I explained to them why I did what I did (same explanation as above), that I was put on the spot, but they still insist I’m in the wrong and that I still shouldn’t have led the prayer since I’m an atheist.

I shared this story with my friends and have garnered mixed feedback. AITA?

TLDR: Prof asks me to lead the opening prayer, I’m atheist but lead the prayer anyway since I didn’t want to risk having the prof negatively react if I declined. Classmate called me out and said that I disrespected their faith by doing that. AITA?",False,False,2,3,2,4,5,3,Purity
1,"AITA for refusing to let a friend just wear a sports bra in my house? | There's a girl I knew from my first job and we remained friends way after I quit. She's told me many stories about her past pregnancies and all sorts of horrors from her abs separating to loose skin and stretch marks. She's had four kids and makes it very clear it keeps getting worse. She likes to go jogging in just a sports bra and high waist leggings.

She recently found out I live basically right beside where she goes jogging and asked if it would be okay to stop by for lunch on occasion. I told her sure, as long as she has a shirt on trying to brush it off as not wanting my neighbors to see a girl walk out of my house in just a bra.

She froze and outright asked if it was because of her stomach and I said yes. She got super upset and changed her mind saying she'll just drive to subway down the road and is refusing to speak to me.

She knew anything pregnancy related makes me feel super uncomfortable and the stomach is the worst... It's not a case of ""eww it's ugly"" because I understand it's natural. It's some sort of phobia. Seeing loose damaged skin from pregnancies, a big weight loss or anything causes me to shutter but apparently I'm a superficial prick according to her.

I made it clear years ago when biggest loser came on in the break room once that loose skin creeps me out to an irrational level and she made it very clear that she has an extreme case of it. AITA for wanting her to cover up?",False,False,3,2,1,1,4,2,Purity
1,"AITA for telling my kids they're allergic to sugar when they really aren't? | I have 2 kids, both in their 20s.  I've always been a single Dad since they were a toddler/infant.   

&#x200B;

I severely limit my sugar intake.  I rarely even eat fruit.  Rarely eat any carbs that aren't also high in fiber.  Its pretty much just meat and veggies.  I have raised my kids this way, more or less.  I think the sugar industry in the US is disgusting.  I think we're poisoning our kids and ourselves with how we've normalized the amount of sugar we consume.  Thats my stance, and I generally keep it to myself.  I'm not interested in criticizing others on what they put into their bodies as its none of my business.  In situations in which people try to force me to eat something with sugar is simply say, ""Can't.  I'm allergic.""  And they immediately back off.  I learned this tactic after many conversations in which people were personally offended I didn't want to eat their donuts/cookies/cakes simply because I didn't want to eat sugar.  

&#x200B;

If you have ever been a parent of small children, you know that everyone loves to dig in their pockets and give your little kids sweets. 

 This old half-wrapped werther's original that some stranger pulled out of their pocket covered in lint, I'm supposed to let my kid eat?  I always turned them down by saying my kids are allergic to sugar. Worked perfectly.  When the kids first started going trick-or-treating I said the same thing.  I took their bags and told them since we're allergic to sugar, they can only eat 1 candy a day...maybe 2 on days they're really good.  Shit lasted the whole damn year (I always checked expiration dates).  We all have other food allergies too, so it was easy to get them to believe me.  

&#x200B;

I don't even remember specifically telling them they're allergic to sugar since they were like 6.  We just lived our lives relatively sugar free.  But fast forward 20 years.  We're at a holiday get-together and someone offered my daughter, now 25, a slice of cake.  She says, ""I can't.  I'm allergic to sugar.""  Later, I pulled her aside and said, ""Taught you well, young padawan.""  She didn't get it.  I'm like dude, we're not actually allergic to sugar we just say that to people who try to force us to eat the shit, right?  I did it when you were younger, and now you're carrying the torch. 

&#x200B;

Her jaw dropped.  She was not faking it, she honestly thought they were allergic.  She yelled at me, then yelled at her brother to yell at me too.  Son didn't care, he laughed.  But Belle was pissed.  She called me a liar and other bad names.  She asked me if they were even allergic to milk.  I said, ""You tell me.  You drank 2 glasses of egg nog at thanksgiving then shit yourself?""  Its been a week and she's insisting her entire life has been a lie.  Again, my Son doesn't care.  Both of my kids are incredibly healthy.  This wasn't a lie I perpetuated throughout their lives...I honestly forgot about it.  It was just something I said when they were kids so they wouldn't eat too much sugar.",False,False,4,2,1,3,5,3,Purity
1,"AITA for refusing to eat food my sister cooked while wearing a bandaid? | Last weekend we had a small family get-together with maybe ten people eating over at my sister's place. She spent most of the day cooking with her daughter, making appetizers and a large enough dinner to feed everyone, and I didn't really see her until we were settling down to eat in her front yard barbecue-style. We had been eating finger foods all day and dinner was a seafood pasta dish in white sauce with assorted vegetables. I noticed she had a bandaid on one of her fingers and offered sympathy that she cut herself making food for all of us and didn't even get to hang out until now, and she brushed it off saying she had burned herself making dinner the night before for her family and the bandaid was just holding burn cream on the blister until it went down. That got my attention, and I asked if she had worn gloves when she was making food.

Her response? ""No, I washed my hands. This isn't a restaurant"". I immediately told her I wasn't eating food she had made with burn cream and an unsanitary bandaid on, which could have at any point come in contact with the food. She rolled her eyes and said I could do what I want, but she wasn't making me anything else-which is fair, the rule in our family has always been you eat what you're served or you make your own. So I did. Since then, though, many close family members have texted me saying I overreacted and it was rude to dismiss food she prepared for me after she had been cooking all day to the point of not having time to socialize. I explained it was unsanitary and I would rather be safe than sorry, and when I pointed out no one would have said anything if I refused a meal at a restaurant on the same grounds my mom replied that it wasn't a restaurant and it wasn't a stranger, it was a family event with my sister and I should apologize. I don't think I did anything wrong-I didn't demand she make me other food, I just didn't eat what I didn't want.

1,"AITA: Is it rude to fart? | Weirdly I was never given specific etiquette advice about this until my wife and I got into a conversation about it.  I asked her why women never seem to fart, and instead of answering that it is because they are embarrassed, she said it was very rude to do so.  Basically she says it's rude to fart anywhere anyone can smell it.

I don't know if it's a guy thing, but no one ever *specifically* told me that farting in public is considered rude.  So I've always figured, if you have to fart, you fart.  Trains, meetings, elevators, whatever.

The wife is gobsmacked that this is even a conversation - curious if there's a definitive consensus on this.
