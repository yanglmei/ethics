1,"Aita for not tipping while on vacation in the state's? | Edit: Nick has accepted that he is the asshole and his reasoning is no way near as justified as he once thought. When he returns to Seattle to see his friend he will make sure to tip

Nick was recently visiting Seattle for a vacation and to meet some long time internet friends and he had an absolute blast but it certainly wasn't very kind on his purse (although obviously that's on him). Back in the UK Nick works as a kitchen porter who earns minimum wage £8.20 per hour (roughly $10) and after learning that the wait staff in Seattle are paid $15 an hr he decided that he is not going to tip. His reasoning is that he works a fairly demanding job, at least as far as kitchen works goes. He spends his day cleaning, carrying and putting away large orders of food and quite frankly he finds this job to be much harder than being a waiter. He did need feel obligated to give additional money to someone who is earning more than him for a much easier job after he had to scrape by for months just to save up for the trip. His American friend said that he was an asshole because they often provided him with ""good service"" which he honestly found to be over bearing and unwanted. They said it was necessary because they often cannot afford to live in the city on minimum wage but he pointed out that he is sure there are many minimum wage workers in the city and it makes no sense to give those workers no consideration, It just doesn't make sense to him.

0,"AITA for not giving Judy's boyfriend the amount of money Judy originally intended? | Judy (24f) recently moved to Australia to live with her boyfriend of 3 years. They met while in Europe where Judy is originally from when her boyfriend studied there.
Judy owed her boyfriend some money (around $8000) which he used to get Judy a car and to pay rent for the first month until Judy's bank account was all set up.
Due to recent events the Australian dollar crashed. So Judy thought now was the perfect time to transfer a heap of money from Judy's European bank account to Judy's Australian one since Judy would get more Australian dollars then than Judy would have just a while ago. It was a pretty good deal for Judy and she immediately paid her boyfriend back. Later that night Judy told him about Judy's little bargain and expected him to be happy for Judy. Instead, he seemed a bit pissed and said it was unfair that suddenly Judy had so much money without working for it and that Judy only got it because the exchange rate worked in Judy's favour. He then said it would only be fair that Judy use the exchange rate of when he bought the car to pay him back.
Judy thinks this is ridiculous because he didn't lose any money. Judy was just lucky. But at the same time Judy is starting over in a new country in a very daunting time so a little extra money is quite comforting.

Judy's boyfriend has been sulking for 4 days now and Judy is starting to question Judy. Maybe Judy is being selfish?
AITA?

Edit. Many people seem to think that he lost money which he hasn't. He was in Australia when he bought the car and paid with Australian dollars. Judy paid him back in Australian dollars. The purchasing power hasn't changed.",False,True
0,"AITA for not wanting Judy’s DH’s EX as part of the family | Judy’s husband and Judy have asked SIL several times to stop bringing Judy’s husband’s EX GF around them. It all started about 5 years ago when out of the blue SIL announces that her and the EX GF are best friends and she’s family. It got to the point that SIL threw a fit that Judy wasn’t inviting the EX GF to Judy’s daughter’s birthday party. This was 3 years ago. Throughout the years she’s stepped on this boundary several times. Judy guesses Judy probably needs to give examples. SIL would call Judy’s husband and ask him to help hang a light fixture etc and when he would arrive, his EX GF would be there. He would remind SIL that he doesn’t want to be around her and it got to where he just stopped showing up when he needed help as he knew it was a ploy.

Judy and her husband thought SIL was done with the boundary stomping regarding the EX. From Jan 2019-Oct 2019 she respected those wishes. So for Halloween Judy reached out to SIL and invited her to bring Judy’s nephew by Judy’s parent’s house to trick or treat and let their kids see each other. She shows up with EX and EX’s son. Judy’s mother shows them the door quickly. While Judy and her husband were incredibly annoyed they chose to just ignore it and move on.

Judy is a photographer. Judy was doing a promo shoot for Santa Minis the Sunday after Halloween. Judy rented a studio and paid FIL $300 to be Judy’s Santa for the sessions. Judy thought it would be nice to get a picture of FIL and his 2 grandkids so Judy invited SIL to bring nephew. SIL shows up with nephew and EX’s kid. Next thing Judy knows she’s getting EX’s kid dressed for pictures and she tells EX’s kid to get in a picture with Judy’s daughter, nephew and FIL so that “FIL has all of his grandchildren in the picture.” At this point, clients are watching so Judy grins and gets through the 15 minutes.

That night Judy’s husband texts SIL and says “Just wanted to remind you that we don’t wish to be around EX GF and when we invite you places we are only inviting you and nephew.” She flips out and goes on about how they’re being mean to a child and how she knows it’s really Judy that has the problem and that Judy’s always hated the EX GF and Judy’s mean. She goes on to say that she will be inviting EX GF and EX GF’s child to Thanksgiving and Christmas so Judy and her husband announce they won’t be attending. Apparently the kid calls Judy’s parent in law’s nana and papaw and they’re in on this weird charade as well. The following day, Judy sent a text to SIL letting her know Judy didn’t appreciate her going off about Judy when Judy wasn’t even the one texting her about it and that if she can’t respect their boundaries she needs to lose their numbers.

Judy’s husband reaches out a week later and tries to work it out with SIL and explain where he’s coming from. SIL says that the only way she will forgive him and move on is if he promises Judy never treats her like dirt again. Judy’s husband asks her to please send him where Judy was mean to her as Judy hadn’t been mean at all. It gets no where.

It’s been a feud since.",False,True
0,"Was Nick the asshole for changing seats during the school trip? | Nick doesn't have many friends in his grade. Basically only two best friends and they decided to sit together on the bus during the school trip to Poland.

Nick's next best option was to sit behind them with the only guy who wasn't paired. He's a gay classmate who's a little weird.

Nick thinks this guy ""H"" has some type of autism. He does things like stare at people inappropriately long, talk loudly or laugh in serious situations. He also doesn't have a good sense of personal boundaries and likes to get very close to people, not realizing it's strange.

That's exactly what happened when Nick sat next to him. H got over-excited when Nick started playing a difficult game on his tablet and kept begging Nick to try it out and distracting him.

When he felt sleepy he asked if he could lean on Nick's shoulder because he can't fall asleep sitting upright. Nick was like, dude no. Personal boundaries and all. But he asked so loudly the guys behind them heard and started laughing, so they and some other classmates teased them that they're secretly a gay couple.

Just to clarify, Nick isn't gay and so H's actions made him uncomfortable. H also then overreacted to those guys teasing them instead of letting the joke die, so of course that added more fuel to fire.

Nick was tired of all this crap and it wasn't worth putting up with just so he could sit near his friends. So Nick lied to the teacher that he was feeling road sick and might throw up, just so she'd bring him over to the front of the bus with her and he'd escape from all the drama.

Was Nick the asshole for doing this? Nick feels bad that H is socially challenged in some way but he doesn't think that's his fault or problem to fix.",False,True
1,"AITA for making out with this dude's ex in front of him? | Nick plays rugby with the guy in question (let's say, ""Mark"") but Nick doesn't usually hang out with Mark outside of matches and practice. Mark broke up with a woman (Jia) that Nick is rather attracted to last week. For the sake of propriety, Nick had no real intention to make moves or anything.

But last night Nick is at a bar, and both Mark and Jia are there. Nick was at a table with some friends, and Mark was a couple tables over. Jia's with her friends as well but after a time comes over to Nick's table and sits next to Nick, starts chatting Nick up. They flirt, and eventually Jia leans in and kisses Nick, and Nick reciprocates. Nick tends to think that PDA of that kind is a bit trashy so after a few seconds Nick gets up with Jia and they go outside, but Nick can see that Mark has been watching the entire time. Mark makes a rude comment to both Nick and Jia as they pass.

Today at practice Mark picked a fight with Nick that would have come to blows if the other guys on the team hadn't held Mark back. Mark is steaming mad. Nick feels a little sorry for Mark, but at the moment Nick can't actually bring Nickself to feel bad about hooking up with Jia, or the fact that Mark was there for it. AITA here?",False,True
1,"AITA for sending Judy's family an angry email because they still speak to Judy's ex-husband and even have him over, especially in light of his present “relationship” with a girl 20 years younger than him? | So basic background is Judy is 42, two kids age 14 and 12 and signed divorce papers in April after almost 2 years of it being drug out trying to get Judy's fair share from him. The details of “why” are not important but Judy is angry, embarrassed, lost and sad any given moment of the day. A lot of this has to do with feeling like Judy has been “replaced” by a 23 year old surfing instructor who is everything Judy is not. Judy's husband and kids claim that she is just his friend and helping him learn his life long desire to surf but Jesus Christ...give Judy a break.

Judy's husband has primary custody because he had better lawyers who were able to manipulate some minor missteps on Judy's part into the court seeing them as a huge deal. So this past weekend Judy picked up the kids and said they were going to visit Judy's parents. They said they would rather use their season passes to sea world since they spent all weekend with Judy's parents and Aunt Stacey and Uncle Brian (Judy's brother and sister who Judy didn’t even know were in town). Judy was like your dad took you? They said yes that Judy's parents had invited him over to see everyone. Judy was devastated because while Judy doesn’t get along with Judy's brother and sister (and Judy's mom) they let Judy's ex-husband know they were coming and not Judy. Judy can’t even let that sink in without tears forming. Judy sort of jested that “oh and let me guess Ms Surf Instructor was there too?” Judy's daughter said “well actually we all went to her house in ocean beach because she gave Stacey and Brian lessons after ours.” That included Judy's mom and dad. Judy was so devastated Judy took the kids back home and just went home and cried for an hour.

When Judy was done Judy sent a furious email to Judy's entire family how inappropriate they all had been and then not only hanging out with Judy's ex for an entire weekend, but his little chippy as well is a massive slap in the face and the fact they didn’t even tell they were in town let alone invite Judy makes Judy feel so alone.

Judy's mom was the only one to respond and she basically said “yes it was rude we didn’t tell you Stacey and Brian were here and we shouldn’t have done that. But we didn’t divorce Bradley, and we still see him as a son. This email along with Judy's behavior over the last 5 years should really give you insight into why we might not want Judy at family events.”

In so many words she called Judy an asshole for sending the email, was Judy?

Edit : to the people installing their own narrative on Judy's post, yta. Just read what Judy wrote in the OP for your decision, ok?",False,True
0,"WIBTA for Judy telling Judy's sister Judy's destination wedding is inconsiderate? | So, sister (26) recently got engaged. She and her fiancé had been pretty secretive about details but invited Judy (31) and Judy's other sister (34) out for drinks and surprised each with a box she made. Judy and Judy's other sister opened them up and inside were little Ireland trinkets. This was her way of telling them that surprise! They’re doing a destination wedding in Ireland..on Christmas Eve 2020. Couple important things to add at this point: Judy lives in the US, Judy's other sister (34) just did a destination wedding in Mexico a few months ago which newly engaged sister complained a lot about (to Judy) due to the cost and inconvenience. Judy's other sister and new husband also have plans to start trying for a baby next month, so she will very likely either be pregnant or have a fresh baby by the time the wedding rolls around. Newly engaged sister knows that Judy's husband and Judy as well as Judy's parents are struggling financially. Judy did Judy's best to act as excited as possible about the wedding, thought Judy pulled it off. But she just sent Judy a shitty text about how it’s bullshit that Judy isn’t acting more excited for her and being supportive. Truth be told, no one in Judy's family is excited. This is going to be costly and it’s hijacking Judy's entire Christmas. WIBTA if Judy flat out tells her sister this? Judy knows she’s stressed and disappointed that people haven’t reacted with more excitement, so Judy doesn’t know if it’s best for Judy to leave it alone because maybe Judy's family is being TA for not being more excited about her big day? She is also not normally an inconsiderate or shitty person so Judy is very taken aback by all this.

Edit: Judy really appreciates all the input, including the YTA and ESH verdicts as it gave Judy perspective into what she may be feeling. At the end of the day though most of the comments made Judy realize how absurd her expectations are. Judy did talk to her, took advice of several people there on how to do that, and she seems to be reconsidering. Judy also suggested she research more because the kind Irish people of Reddit had some good points about weather and availability for Christmas Eve. Judy thinks she is leaning towards ceremony here and honeymoon in Ireland.",False,True
0,"AITA for telling Nick's manager that their new spa lead asked Nick for heroin? | So pretext: 

She moves up here to get away from her boyfriend of 2 years that have been getting into bad arguments and finally ended up spitting on her. She texts Nick later that night asking if Nick knows anyone with heroin for her friend/roomate. She was withdrawing super badly and she felt bad and had never seen it get this bad before. Nick told her no but get a medical card and take high doses of weed and it won't be as bad. Completely ignored that. She comes in the next day saying she was up all night vomiting from food allergies. Then asks to go home bc she doesn't feel good bc she's vomiting still. End of shift comes and her drawer is missing $20. So Nick tells mg hey spa lead asked Nick for this shit also there's $20 missing from the drawer she opened this morning. After talking with mg and another associate about how much they know about her they all say she lives with her mom and brother when she told Nick she lives with a roommate. Nick and mg talk more and she lets Nick know that spa lead had had problems with heroin before according to former associates at the spa she relocated from. So time goes by and they don't say anything to her until now and today she is suspended for 5 days and knows Nick told mg. She asked Nick why Nick would do that and Nick just asked her what her friends name is, bc Nick honestly doesn't think she's real and fuck heroin and Nick's not dealing w a drugged out bitch shooting up in the bathrooms and calling an ambulance for narcan. Is Nick really the asshole here? Sure Nick shouldn't get involved with work drama but c'mon

Update: Nick and three others are gonna simultaneously quit bc of how the owners treated their mg for handling the situation, as professionally as she could basically not telling until she knew it wasn't just drama, aaaaand spa lead was relocated to their spa like 200 miles away to get her sober bc she had already been using and selling at the spa she relocated from. They never told their mg about these issues when spa lead relocated so lmao bye.",False,True
0,"AITA for ditching Nick's friend in Colombia after he crushed Nick? | AITA for ditching Nick's friend in Colombia? So, here’s the background...Nick went to Colombia with a friend Nick had known for a few years, but doesn’t know a ton about Nick's teen/child years because they were pretty tough and Nick doesn’t want people to feel sorry for Nick or anything like that. He was generally good company.

So one day they were walking around town and talking about food. Then he says something along the lines of Nick never having to worry about where a meal came from.

So Nick bit the bullet and mentioned Nick was a homeless teen. Nick didn’t elaborate much more than Nick's mom kicking Nick out and Nick living out of Nick's car on the beach or in parking lots. (When in actuality Nick's mom was an addict and was simply “tired” of taking care of Nick's older sister and Nick so she kicked them out) Nick also mentioned bc Nick made so little money bc Nick was in HS, sometimes Nick couldn’t afford to eat. It’s not Nick's proudest time of Nick's life.

He then says “Well that’s pathetic.” That really crushed Nick's soul. Nick isn’t a sensitive person, but that was some of the hardest times of Nick's life. Not knowing when you’ll eat next as a teen is awful. Hell for anyone. It’s nothing Nick would have ever chosen.

It felt like Nick was punched in the chest. He had the room key so Nick didn’t say shit until later that night. They went to dinner and Nick basically told him Nick was leaving him to a trip by himself bc of what he said was so painful and hurtful to Nick. He denies it...but trust Nick...if someone says something like that to you, you remember.

He asked for 10 mins to talk to Nick, so Nick allowed it. Then Nick went on Nick's way with Nick's crap and went to a hostel after his pleading for Nick to stay with him. So Reddit, is Nick the Asshole?

Edit: in their talk he never apologized, he tried to convince Nick Nick was misremembering what he said, yet he couldn’t tell Nick what he said when Nick asked. He then tried to say ohh if he said that, that’s not what he meant.

They are both native English speakers.

Additional edit: Nick isn’t sure Nick would have been as sensitive as Nick was without the prior night’s conversation.

(They were talking about life in general, and their trajectory)

Him: are you happy?

Nick: Yes Nick is

him: you can’t possibly be happy.

Nick: uhh Nick is. How can you possibly say that? Nick has a great job that gives Nick plenty of time off (Nick works 4-10’s), gets to travel for free 30+ countries and counting (yey work perks!), skydives for fun, has a masters degree, a SO Nick is incredibly happy with, Nick's job doesn’t have the highest pay but has incredible perks and work/life balance.",False,True
1,"AITA for not asking Nick's sister to apologize to his girlfriend? | GF of 3 years and cousin(f) had a fight a long time ago and made up. They like each other now, but at the time, it caused a massive rift between GF and that side of Nick's family. Cousin and GF both admitted they were wrong. Whole family (bro/sis/aunt/cousin) wanted Nick and his GF to split but everyone agreed to start fresh when Nick told them they were expecting their 1yo. Everyone did but Nick's sister, who's been passive aggressive to Nick's GF ever since. She started fights between Nick and his GF, tried to get Nick to dump his GF. Nick told his GF to deal with it so it wouldn’t become a new fight. GF got angrier over time, didn’t feel like she could talk to Nick. Things got worse when Nick's son was born and Nick's sister didn't respect his GF as the mother of Nick's child. Didn't listen to what GF said about Nick's son and still tried to break Nick and his GF up. GF tried to mend things with Nick's sister a few times but she never stopped and GF stopped wanting to when Nick's sister began disrespecting his GF as a mom. GF vented to a random fb group and Nick's sister happened to see. GF admits fb was a bad place to vent but also says she wouldn't have had to vent if Nick put a stop to things to start. Nick's sister sent screenshots. Nick heard a lot of the comments GF mentioned and his sister did say them. Nick's sister said GF was lying to manipulate Nick and wasn't allowed in her house anymore, demanded Nick split with his GF. Nick gently said that he heard his sister say some of them but said he was sure she didn't mean them how GF took. Nick knew she did but wanted to diffuse things. Nick's sister said Nick wasn't defending her. Nick got angry because he clearly was. When Nick didn't back down, his sister texted Nick's GF about every complaint Nick made about his GF to her, plus some fake things. Nick had said the true things to his GF too so she wasn't mad at the comments, but was mad Nick said them to his sister after she told Nick not to discuss her with his sister because she knew Nick's sister would try to use it against her or cause problems. Nick's sister insulted Nick to his GF and said Nick was a shitty person who didn't care about his family and said Nick could go and live his shitty life. GF defended Nick and that made his sister angrier. Nick and his sister didn't speak for a while, but family is having a party for Nick's other cousin(f) for her divorce. Nick's sister is here. Nick wasn't planning on talking to her, but she apologized to Nick and they're drinking and having a good time. Nick told his GF that his sister and Nick are great now and they're bonding. GF asked if she apologized. Nick said yes. GF asked if Nick's sister was still going to attack her. Nick said who knows. Nick just wants to enjoy time with his sister but GF is pissed. GF feels like Nick is throwing her under the bus, not acting like a team, Nick is just letting his sister bully her so Nick doesn't have to stand up to his sister. But this is Nick's sister and Nick doesn't want to fight with her. If Nick brings it up, she'll probably get mad and she and Nick might stop talking all over again. Nick doesn't think his GF should put him in that position.

AITA for not asking her to apologize to Nick's GF or for not bringing up the attacks and asking her to stop from now on?

Update: Other members of Nick's family gave Nick hard drugs when Nick was drunk. Told Nick to lie to his GF. Nick didn't and realized how fucked up they are. Nick is cutting off that entire side of his family. Not going to the pool party or anything else ever again. GF took video of Nick admitting to the drug use with Nick's consent and they agreed if Nick ever does it again or speaks to that side of his family, she's showing the police and Nick is never allowed near their son again.

0,"AITA for making Judy's guest feel 'attacked' | Judy lives in a 4 bedroom with 2 other people and Judy got the master bedroom with the En suite bathroom so when Judy's friend said she wanted to sleep over (she lives 2 hours away) Judy said yes. Judy and her friend hadn't seen each other in months so Judy thought it would be nice to spend time together since they used to be very close. Anyway, a few incidents happened.

On Saturday the friend wanted to cook so Judy pointed out Judy's kitchen stuff (separated from Judy's housemates'). Well when the friend was using Judy's non stick pan, she used the metal spatula to stir. Judy didn't want the coating to come off so Judy said, ""hey, that spatula is not Judy's. Here's Judy's"" and gave the friend Judy's wooden one. The friend said Judy's housemate (they met earlier while Judy was out getting groceries) said it was fine to use her stuff. Judy told the friend Judy preferred her using the wooden one. The friend just shrugged and took it but Judy could tell she was offended.

Saturday night Judy had to leave the friend for a dinner with Judy's coworkers. Judy didn't invite the friend because the dinner was sort of a thank you thing for them completing a project and was paid for using leftover money they collected for the project. The friend was offended she was not invited even after Judy explained. She said she would pay for herself. However there were about 10 of Judy's coworkers including Judy's boss and the conversation revolved around work anyway so Judy thought it would be awkward if Judy suddenly brought another person. No one else brought even their SO. So Judy left the friend at home (she has her own car).

On Sunday the friend did her laundry. She left the clothes in the machine for an hour after it was done because she was on her phone. When she went to get it, she saw that Judy's housemate had taken them out and put them in the basket because she wanted to use the machine. So the friend bitched at Judy that Judy's housemate was 'so rude' for handling her laundry. Judy said it was NBD because the housemate needed to use the machine too and the friend was taking her time.

Anyway, after the friend went home Judy suddenly got a text from the friend's bf basically telling Judy Judy was an asshole for making the friend feel uncomfortable. He said Judy had no idea how to treat a guest properly and Judy was rude and unwelcoming. Judy means, Judy tried to be tactful but Judy guesses the friend was offended anyway. So AITA here?

ETA: Judy knows Judy is the AH for the dinner. If it makes a difference, Judy told the friend in advance about it. Judy messed up because Judy didn't say ""You can't come though"" and let the friend think it was a casual thing where anyone can join. But other than those 1 hour dinner (Judy made excuses to leave early), they did spend the whole weekend together. So thanks everyone for pointing out how rude it was to leave a friend alone when they're here as a guest.

Edit/Update: Thank you everyone for weighing in. Judy does feel a bit better to see lots of NTAs. Judy replied to the boyfriend asking specifically what the friend said she was upset about but he didn't give Judy a clear answer. So Judy texted the friend that morning, apologizing for making her upset and she basically laughed it off and said she had a great time (??). Judy told the friend that her bf texted Judy and the friend didn't reply. Judy doesn't know, maybe the friend was just venting to her bf and he thought he would go all white knight and defend her honour or something. You guys have also made Judy question whether Judy wants to keep this friendship. Judy does realise Judy has been 'couching' Judy's words with the friend because she can get offended easily when directly called out. It wasn't a big deal before but this whole weekend visit thing did sort of open Judy's eyes that maybe, if Judy can't even say something simple like ""dude, you're gonna scratch Judy's pan with that metal thing"" because Judy was afraid of the friend's reaction then maybe it's not a healthy friendship anyway. So it feels a little bit like a small personal growth for Judy. Things are kind of up in the air with the friend and Judy right now but Judy has decided not to worry so much about it.",False,True
0,"Is Nick the asshole for not wanting to donate sperm to his (sterile) identical twin brother’s wife? | Nick's brother, who Nick has a very strong bond and good relationship with, has been trying for years to get his wife pregnant, all to no avail. It’s believed that he’s sterile, and this saddens him (and Nick) very greatly. A while ago, they accepted that he is unlikely to ever have biological children, and began looking for a sperm donor. But just recently, they posed a new, unconventional idea to Nick - that Nick be the donor.

Asking one's brother to donate sperm for oneself might be an odd or even inappropriate request in most circumstances, but Nick and his brother's situation is a unique one - they are identical twins. They share 100% identical DNA, and thus any child born of Nick's sperm would be related to his brother every bit as much as his own child from his own sperm would. This would not be the case with regular brothers, where the baby would be related as a nephew/niece to him. And because of this, the child wouldn’t find out about the “donation” from one of those home DNA tests so many people are taking now - Nick and his brother both would show up as the father on any DNA test because of their identical DNA.

Nick's brother views having an identical twin as a great stroke of luck in this situation, and an opportunity to be able to have his own children after all. Despite his enthusiasm, Nick is not so sure about the whole thing. Nick hasn’t officially declined; he just told his brother that “he’ll think about it.” Nick is married, and just thinks the whole thing seems a bit weird and “off”. Is Nick the asshole for not thinking about his brother’s need first and foremost?

UPDATE: Nick thanked everyone for sharing their thoughts. Nick has thought things over a lot this past day, and has decided that he is going to go through with the sperm donation after all, and allow his brother to have a child.",False,True

1,"WIBTA for asking Judy's boyfriend to revoke his cat's ""girlfriend status""? | Judy (21) has a boyfriend (20) who has a cat whom he's completely in love with. Saying this is not at all exaggerated. He fawns over her like one would *maybe* do over a new kitten for the first day, but he had this cat since he was seven. Basically, Judy is jealous of the cat. This sounds so pathetic but please hear Judy out:

He treats the cat as if she were his girlfriend and not Judy. The only things they don't do are french kissing and having intercourse. For real: she gets more physical attention than Judy ever did. When he's cooking, Cat always gets a small piece of meat before it's seasoned but he rarely shares anything with Judy that way. Cat has her own chair at his family's table. This might have been normal in his family of four at a table with four chairs and a bench but Judy is always seated on the bench when Judy is over, as to not take Cat's chair. He talks to Cat like one would to a human partner, sometimes even calls her ""darling"" or similar.

He gives her those pecks on the forehead which aren't that uncommon for pet owners, (Judy did so herself when Judy had a dog) but he does so in passing all the time like they're a newly in love couple. Yesterday they were lying forehead to forehead, cuddling for at least half an hour. If they're watching TV and she's in his lap first Judy is not allowed to disrupt her to cuddle with him. When coming home he often greets her before Judy or does so more enthusiastically.

Basically, he's totally obsessed with this cat to a point that it seems unhealthy. Apart from that, he's the perfect guy for Judy, they rarely even fight about anything. Cat is also really sweet, Judy loves her like she's Judy's, but Judy is not willing to share her spot as girlfriend with her. His family roll their eyes to this, but they seem to view it as still reasonable. Judy is worried for her boyfriend and, admittedly, also a bit jealous. Judy also fears what's going to happen when Cat dies eventually; after all she'll be 13 this month so she's definitely not young anymore.

So when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal than Nick would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. For example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. Nick's wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with Nick's SIL. Nick's wife would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by Nick's SIL and Nick's SIL would basically replace it with her own idea. So that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. Otherwise everyone in Nick's family has been supportive and excited. The baby is due at the end of this month.

So last night Nick's wife received a Facebook message thread, including Nick's parents and other family, from Nick's SIL that said in order for any of them to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, they would need to bring their vaccination records to show that they're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten their seasonal flu shot. Nick's wife lost it. Nick's wife started saying how completely insane Nick's SIL and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet their nephew.

While Nick said that he agrees they are being a bit on the extreme side, Nick can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. They can't afford to go through IVF again and Nick's SIL is too old it would be high risk anyway. Nick's entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on their shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. They would just need to get their records. Nick also said he can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so Nick can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that they wouldn't put their own family (the baby) in harm's way. But overall, Nick sort of understands why they're being careful and it's no big deal.

Well Nick's wife took this as Nick siding with them over her. Nick's wife has been angry with Nick ever since. AITA?

(Also, please don't reply with ""YOu sHOuLd AlWays SiDe wiTH YOur WiFE! hUrrr Dee DurRR"". Nick doesn't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... Don't bother.)

Edit title: Nephew :/

Edit 2: While Nick's wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough Nick thinks the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking them (and Nick's parents). They are pretty close. They all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. They watch their kids, they watch their dog, etc. There's always been full trust between them. And Nick thinks she feels insulted like they're not being trusted. Nick doesn't know if that changes anything? For those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?

Edit 3: Holy cow, this blew up since last Nick checked. First of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. To address some common questions/comments... 1) No, Nick's SIL has no good reason to think they would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). Once again, they are all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, they would all know. And there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) No, they did not ensure family was up to date on shots when their kids were born. Nick feels like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? It was a while ago, Nick doesn't exactly recall. 3) It is highly unlikely Nick's wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. She's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower Nick's SIL had. It was more the fact that Nick's SIL rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) Nick probably shot himself in the foot on this one with the title... But Nick didn't really ""take a side"", at least Nick wouldn't consider it that. It's not like Nick said, ""Well hun, they are right and you are wrong"". It was more the fact that Nick wasn't as outraged as his wife about the whole thing that made her think Nick was taking their side (Nick thinks?). So take that for what it's worth. 5) Nick appreciates the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... Nick feels like that's what Nick tried to do here. Maybe Nick didn't handle it to perfection and Nick agrees it will probably blow over (hopefully). Maybe Nick will send an update if anyone is interested.

Edit 4: Just cause it's hilarious that Nick actually has to address this... But no, Nick was not implying that just because the baby is IVF or their ""one shot"" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. Not quite sure how some folks deduced that. Nick was merely saying that due to those circumstances Nick could more easily empathize with Nick's SIL's somewhat extreme (Nick's imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother Nick as much as it did his wife.",False,True
0,"WIBTA if Judy (23F) asked her friend (23F) to be her maid of honor, instead of her sister (26F)? | Judy's sister and Judy used to plan their dream weddings together when they were kids. They always said they would be each other’s maids of honor. As they grew up they stopped (but still shared cute dresses they found online) until Judy's sister got engaged and asked Judy to be her maid of honor. It was amazing and fun and it was great to look back on all those times as kids. Judy's sister and Judy are still really close.

Judy recently got engaged and she wants her sister to be maid of honor, but to be honest it’s just a lot of work. Judy's sister is very busy and she’s not exactly organized. Judy had to help her sister fix some logistical problems for her sister's wedding that could have been prevented fairly easily with better organization on her sister's part. Judy’s fiancé and Judy don’t have a lot of money, and a lot of the wedding is going to be diy. 

Judy's very close friend is already very excited, and is sending Judy cute cheap ideas that fit Judy's theme. Judy's friend is very logistical and is amazing at planning and budgeting. Judy's friend is an artist and wants to help with the diys. Judy hasn’t even picked bridesmaids and her friend is already being absolutely amazing.

Judy wants to ask her friend to be maid of honor because Judy doesn’t want to give the maid of honor responsibilities to her sister. Judy thinks her sister would hate it, other than the actual day of. Judy knows her friend would do an amazing job but Judy doesn’t want to hurt her sister. 

Would Judy be the asshole if she asked her friend to be her maid of honor instead of her sister?

Tl;dr: Judy doesn’t want to hurt her sister by asking her friend to be her maid of honor instead of her sister",False,True
0,"AITA for saying Judy cares more about her bird than the dog? Judy knows that based off of the title alone Judy sounds like an a-hole but Judy just wants someone else's opinion. Judy is making this post on mobile so there may be some spelling errors, and is also using a throwaway account as family also use reddit.

Judy (19 F) owns a bird for almost a year now and a dog for almost a month. Judy struggles a lot with anxiety and depression, but more so in the recent years with anxiety which caused her to not leave the house, Judy is on medication for quite a few months but they haven't been doing anything.

Almost a year ago now in May her mother and brother decided to get Judy a bird, a pineapple green cheek conure more specifically. And since then Judy has been speaking a bit more to people, started to smile more and get out of bed, which was a big improvement with how Judy has been before getting him.

Now Judy loves dogs don't get her wrong, her brother has one who Judy loves very much, but Judy never wanted a dog for herself. The reason for that is cause Judy personally thinks that its very draining to have one.

Judy has told her parents this when they asked her if Judy wanted a dog, even after Judy said no they went ahead and got Judy one.

This doesn't mean Judy hasn't been looking after her dog, Judy bathes her, gives her fresh food and water everyday and brings her out on a walk when Judy has the energy to do so and also plays with her too!

But doing all of this has been draining Judy a lot and Judy has been having more anxiety attacks and struggling to get out of bed, which then leads to her parents yelling at her.

Looking after her bird has never been draining, Judy gives him food and water everyday gives him attention, cleans his cage and plays with him too.

Judy cares about them both, but when her parents were telling her off for not getting out of bed Judy said she cared more about her bird than she did the dog and Judy never wanted her.

Judy will be honest Judy shouldn't have said she never wanted her but it was in the moment and Judy was so tired of everything.

So Judy was wondering AITA?

When Nick's brother was 23 he had around 500k in investments/savings. Since then Nick's brother has donated a large proton (near 320k), quit his job as a Jr Programmer, left 100k for his kids and a small portion for which just Incase something happens. Now Nick's brother has 10k CC debt, student loans for going back to school for wanting his MBA, and works in a call center while doing his masters. This all started when Nick's brother had a mental health issue. Nick's brother has aniexty/depression which Nick believes fueled this. Nick's brother's wife states Nick's brother wouldn’t start to get help until after his kids were born. Nick told him to quit his job go back to programming, leave his wife and start stacking his money again. Nick's brother told Nick it’s not an option, the medical coverage covers his treatment and treatment is helping him repress not wanting to harm himself. Nick told Nick's brother he needs to just man up and get over it or he’ll be broke. AITA?

Edit: Nick can see how Nick may been insensitive to Nick's brother's situation. Nick just can’t stay shy and watch Nick's brother waste his life away. Everything their parents worked for and grand parents. Nick is not the only one disappointed in the family, just the only one to say something. Obviously Nick cares about his brothers Nick just wants to help.

1,"WIBTA If Nick keeps the phone that Nick found? | Nick was riding his bike and found a phone in the road face up and literally obliterated. It was to the point where it was beyond recognition but using detective skills Nick found out it was a note 9.  

Nick made a Craigslist lost and found ad and hasn’t seen any response. Nick also pulled the SIM card and put it in an old phone to find the number. It turns out it’s the phone of a local businessman who lives a few blocks over. To make a long story short , Nick tracked him down and found his Facebook and messaged him to say that Nick found his phone and yadayada.  

It’s been almost a week and Nick hasn’t heard a response. Is it wrong if Nick unsends his messages and just keeps it ?  

Giving it back would be useless because it’s so destroyed that there’s no way he could ever get any data back and Nick doubts he lacks the knowledge to replace the screen. If Nick kept it Nick would fix it if possible and use it in place of his phone. Nick is so torn. Nick is urgently trying to decide so Nick can order parts and try to fix it but Nick is not fixing it if there’s a possibility it goes back to him.  

Edit: Nick knows where he lives,yes. But Nick is going to come off as some creepy stalker if Nick drops it off there because Nick had to do some real detective work to find his address in the first place. Nick doesn’t know him personally nor through a friend, not at all in fact.  

Edit again: Thank you all for setting Nick straight and opening his eyes to his selfishness. Nick returned the phone to a very happy previous owner, Nick was able to track him down and get a hold of him through a friend of a friend who just so happened to know him.

1,"AITA for not caring about the book his wife is reading? | This is such a quarantine argument btw lmao...

So, Nick's wife was reading a book yesterday and kept going on telling Nick about the book. Not like a, ""oh this book is good, its about xyz"". Nick meant she was trying to tell him about characters and their interactions, why this one character's childhood caused her to go into this certain field etc etc. Honestly, Nick doesn't give a crap about fictional characters in a book that he would never read. For context, his wife is usually doing this with other things...example, ""You know that girl I used to cheer with, Rebecca?...No?...oh, well her brother got arrested for selling drugs"". Kind of thing...as in, ok so some stranger Nick doesn't know got arrested. Cool.  

This is not some big contentious thing in their relationship, just an annoying thing that happens occasionally, but it is what it is. Maybe it is the quarantine, but instead of just nodding and saying ""ok cool"", Nick essentially told her he doesn't really care to hear about the interworkings of this book. For the record, Nick currently feels like an ass, because she got really upset, was crying because he told her he doesn't care, which he did say that. He doesn't want to make her sad, nor did he realize it was that important to her. Ultimately he did apologize, because he upset her, but in terms of his feelings that upset her, he really still..doesn't give a shit about hearing about this kind of stuff. When Nick reads a book, he doesn't tell her anything. He may say, oh that book he just read was good or bad, but that's it, so it it hard for him to even understand why anyone would do that. So, is Nick the asholes for not giving two shits about the characters in his wife's fictional book?  

Edit update: thanks for the replies everyone. Nick has come to the conclusion, based on your wonderful feedback, that he was the asshole. Sometimes a swift kick in the ass is all you need. He has since apologized again, this time with her favorite cookies. And ultimately asked her to tell him about her book again, which she did.",False,True
0,"AITA for telling Judy's brother to leave Judy's room because Judy wanted to change? | Recently Judy's brother (M) moved back into Judy's house and he’s been spending a lot of time in Judy's room. Judy doesn’t mind him being in Judy's room as long as Judy's not changing or anything. Today, Judy's brother was playing games on Judy's playstation and the conversation went as followed:

Judy: Hey, can you please leave the room for a minutes Judy wants to change.
M: I’m playing can’t you change in the bathroom.
Judy: Please, M, Judy likes changing in Judy's room.
M: It’s multiplayer i can’t pause it.
(This was a lie because he was playing a story mode game and Judy's played it. You can pause it at any time without it affecting the game)
Judy: You can pause it, please!

At this point Judy's grandma (G) comes into Judy's room.
G: Why are you fighting?
Judy: Judy's not fighting, Judy just wants M to leave Judy's room.
G: I see that you only like to fight!

M leaves Judy's room and G walks away and Judy gets dressed. When Judy's finished Judy goes up to M to tell him he can go back in. He goes back to playing games in Judy's room. Judy gets a chair and begins to do Judy's makeup. G comes back in the room

G: See this is how it’s supposed to be. You need to share.
Judy: It’s not that Judy doesn’t like to share. Judy wants Judy's own space to change.
G: That’s why you have the bathroom.
Judy: Judy likes to change in Judy's room. And Judy lets M be in Judy's room. Judy just asked him to leave for a minute because Judy wants Judy's privacy.
G: Well, you don’t mind sharing your room with your boyfriend.
(at this point Judy begins to get a little annoyed and Judy raised Judy's voice)
Judy: Judy does not change in front of Judy's boyfriend.
G: Sure you don’t.
Judy: (still with Judy's voice raised) G, you do not understand. Judy does let M be in here but Judy wanted him to leave for 5 minutes while Judy gets dressed.
G: This is why I don’t like to be in here you only like fighting.

Judy just walked away. Judy's life has been like this ever since M moved back in. G and Judy's mom always thinks Judy's being selfish. they say Judy only likes to fight. Judy knows Judy shouldn’t be yelling but Judy gets really mad that they don’t defend Judy when Judy's brother does something bad. Judy's brother is 24 and Judy's 16. Reddit, AITA in this situation?

Edit: Thank you for everyone’s advice. Judy now realizes what Judy should do. Judy can’t change Judy's family or the way they think. Judy's just going to try to deal with it and move out as soon as Judy can. For the people suggesting Judy should get a lock on Judy's door, Judy is looking into it. Judy's going to leave Judy's playstation in Judy's room but hide the remote. Judy's going to speak to Judy's school counselor soon.

1,"AITA because Nick put a dirty item in the sink that his wife accidentally threw away? | This happened yesterday and his wife was legitimately pissed, although Nick fails to see how it was his fault. 

His wife loves lattes (Nick doesn’t drink coffee), and they have an expresso maker with a removable tip for the milk frothing steam wand. Nick makes the lattes most of the time, and he always wipes the tip down with a wet towel when he’s done. Nick can always tell when his wife makes a latte, however, because she never wipes the wand down, and it’s left covered with dried or even burnt milk. Since Nick tends to be the next person to use it, he ends up scrubbing the dried and burnt milk off. 

Yesterday afternoon, his wife was washing dishes and Nick noticed that the tip was covered in dried milk. Nick unscrewed it, held it between two fingers, shoved it in front of her face, and threw it in the sink. Fast forward a few hours and his wife notices the tip is missing and asks Nick where it is. Nick explains what he just said to her, and she concludes that she must have thrown it in the garbage when she emptied the sink drain strainer. 

This turned into a big argument over who had to dig through the garbage bag to find it. His wife said it was Nick's fault because Nick’s the one who put it in the sink and that there was no way she would have known it was there (she also tried to claim she wasn’t washing dishes - she was merely sorting ones to go in the dishwasher and ones to be hand washed). Nick thinks it’s her fault because she’s the one who left it dirty and, you know, actually threw it in the trash. She got so worked up (many FUs were directed toward Nick) Nick ended up going to bed while she stayed downstairs for an hour mad about it. 

TLDR; wife threw away a tiny item for the expresso maker. Thinks it’s Nick's fault because Nick put it in the sink to be washed.

Update: It seems the verdict is somewhere between YTA and ESH, so Nick ended up digging the tip out of the garbage. Thanks Reddit.",False,True
0,"AITA for telling his mom's friend to shut up and stop telling him how he will die? | So Nick is fourteen, and he was diagnosed with type one diabetes when he was eleven. A lot of people don’t realize how serious of a disease it is, until you or a loved one has been affected by it. Generally, Nick is completely independent with taking shots, pricking his finger, but he does have slip ups, and his family understands, as this is a tough disease and a lot of responsibility that popped up out of nowhere for a kid. 
Throughout his daily life Nick deals with a lot of dumbasses who are uneducated, but that’s a part of normal life too. His mom has a friend who had a husband that died due to complications with the disease. Let’s call her Nancy. Nancy likes to try to “educate” him on his own disease. 

Just a little background, you basically never fully understand the disease until you yourself has it. And the disease is fairly unique to each individual, how your blood sugar reacts to certain foods, how it changes over time, etc.
Everytime she comes over she likes to try to “scare him with facts” by telling him how he’s not responsible enough , and how her husband died from the disease and how it’s going to happen to him and whatnot if he doesn’t shape up. Nick gets that you may not want that to happen to somebody else, but he’s still a fucking kid, he has basically realized after so many horrible visits to the hospital, that he will probably die from this disease, an already morbid realization for a kid. 

So last night, she came over, and Nick was eating a chocolate bar. His mom asked him if he tested his blood sugar, he said no and rushed to get that done, sometimes he forgets, but no damage has been done yet. Nick comes back and reports his nice blood sugar, and he is about to leave the room when Nancy says” if you keep messing up like that, you are going to end up like my last husband, who died from the disease and...” Nick rolls his eyes as she has said this SO.MANY.TIMES. He is fed up, he shoots a mean look and replies “Well Nancy he sure am glad you are here! Why don’t you shut your mouth and let him figure out this disease for himself? And please shut up about the whole dying crap, ok?” He runs to his room on the verge of tears, because he can’t believe what he just did and he is freaking tired of hearing this. Later, his mom tells him she wants him to apologize to Nancy. 
While Nick does understand he probably should’ve ignored her, he doesn’t think telling a kid how he is going to die repeatedly is ok, especially for an adult who is older than forty. He is starting to think he was too rude and he may be the asshole here.What do you guys think?

EDIT: for those of you saying his mom is in the wrong here too, he totally understands. But he’s pretty sure his mom is one of Nancy’s closest friend, kinda like an emotional support human. So while his mom understands why he’s mad, she understands Nancy more than most people, and he assumes Nancy has some unknown problems. And this is a unique situation, his mom fought the entire county school board just so he can stay at his school, check his levels during tests, and more. So while his mom may look like a neglectful cunt, just give her the benefit of the doubt, ok?

DOUBLE EDIT: Nick cannot express how much he appreciates those who have cheered him up and helped him feel better in the comments, saying you believe in him, how it gets better, etc. and to his fellow diabetics who have came together and told him how this disease doesn’t have to control him, thanks so much to you too! And to those who have messaged him, sending him thoughtful, and very kind words, thanks soo much! He is feeling much more down to earth and has been thinking with his head, and not his emotions, thanks to everybody! Just wanted to express his gratitude",False,True

Judy works real long hours plus Judy is always on Judy's feet, it's exhausting so usually when the children arent there Judy gets home and relaxes, couldn't do this while she was visiting.

First night she was there they went out for dinner, Judy was home early (6pm)

Second night she was there Judy got home late (9:30PM) grabbed a snack and headed to bed.

Third night she was there Judy ordered a takeaway (8:50PM), grabbed a drink and watched tv.

0,"AITA for telling a lady she can't bring her kid to gym? | So here's the situation: Nick had just recently started working out (2 months). The gym Nick went to was excellent, everyone was super friendly and Nick was genuinely enjoying it. But, about half the time Nick went there, Nick went at the same time a lady (around 35yo) went - and she brought her 8ish yo son along.

The gym had a special place for children, but the place was ridiculously small and there was nothing to do in there. From what Nick gathered the kid had no phone, so he had resorted to *playing around with the gym equipment*.

He ran up and down the gym, twirling around bench presses, gym equipment and people. He jumped rope, he used the ""trampoline"". He punched the punching bag and climbed the stretching bars.

Nick had talked to him, asked him not to run around, and he ignored Nick, as kids do. Nick had talked to the gym instructor and he made light of it. Everyone seemed to enjoy the kid, but Nick.

And then last week Nick was trying to stretch on the stretching area, but the kid was using it as a playing field and kicking a ball around - using a huge amount of space. Nick asked the gym instructor to please ask the kid to move to another place, and instead he dictated that Nick should go stretch somewhere else (but he wasn't rude or anything, more in a ""let the kid play"" vibe).

But Nick got pissed off, so when Nick left Nick formally complained to the administration, and explained that Nick was genuinely afraid the kid would eventually get hurt (which Nick was, but Nick was actually more annoyed than anything). The administration lady seemed completely utterly fake when she agreed with Nick.

Nick felt like a super asshole, but there has been no kid around since that day.",False,True
0,"AITA for telling his wife she needs to breastfeed their baby or go back to work? Nick knows the title makes Nick sound like an asshole but Nick is hoping his explanation doesn’t. 
His wife exclusively bf their daughter for 6 mos. after she returned to work it was too hard to find time to pump as a busy ER nurse so they switched to formula. No big deal. When their daughter was 18 mos old his wife was miserable in her job due to a new mgr and wanted to quit. They crunched the numbers, sold a car, downsized a lot and made it work. It’s super tight. They had about $50-$75/month left after bills, groceries, etc. 
A year ago his wife talks about wanting another baby. Nick was about to start a nurse anesthetist program and told her he’d prefer to wait when their situation was better. She talked about how since they already had cloth diapers, all the baby gear and she could EBF this time since she wasn’t working that it wouldn’t add anything to their finances. Nick reiterated he’d prefer to wait which she took to Nick not saying no, went off bc without telling Nick and was pregnant in a couple months 
Fast forward to 16 weeks post partum and his wife says she doesn’t want to ebf anymore bc formula is easier. She’s having no supply issues or latch issues-she just doesn’t want to anymore. Nick told her that they couldn’t afford formula and if that’s what she wanted to do then she’d have to go back to work. She could easily find a PRN position and work a few times a month. Nick is in school M-Thurs but home mid afternoon and Nick works weekends and their parents both said they’d provide childcare if need be. His wife thinks Nick should just pick up an extra shift which Nick could do but currently Nick has every other Friday off and it’s his day to study, do some chores and spend time with his family. 
Before anyone asks-Nick is heavily involved in the household. Nick cleans and cooks and takes care of the kids just as much as his wife (except bf). The older one is in pre-K during the day so it’s not like it’s hard to nurse the baby bc she’s minding the toddler. It’s her body and if she wants to stop that’s fine but even with coupons, discounts, etc. $15-$35 dollar cans of formula are not in their budget.

Quick Edit: His wife is getting roasted in the comments. Nick was going to leave out how she got pregnant but felt like it would make it seem like they weren't careful and Nick would be an asshole because Nick should've been more careful and not gotten her pregnant. His wife's intent was not to deceive Nick or go behind his back to get pregnant. The conversations around having another baby were long and plentiful with Nick agreeing with her on a lot of stuff like, yes it'd be nice to have kids a little closer in age, yes Nick can see how her revised budget would work, yes Nick knows it took a long time for her to get pregnant before, yes Nick thinks Maddy would be a great big sister. But at the end Nick always said ""he’d prefer to wait."" It took them a year after his wife went off birth control to get pregnant the first time. She assumed it'd take the same amount of time and if she timed it well then going off birth control when she did and then 3/4 of a year of pregnancy, Nick would almost be graduated. She should absolutely have told Nick she never refilled her bc prescription but she made a mistake, they worked through it and she is not a horrible person.",False,True
1,"AITA for spraying Nick's neighbour's children with his hose? | Nick would consider himself the ""fun"" guy of the neighbourhood. He gets along with everyone, is pretty funny, and generally sociable with all his neighbours. Part of that means that he enjoys playing jokes.

Each day, when the school bus drops off Nick's neighbour's children (they are in primary school), he likes to wait and blast them with the hose. He finds this really funny, and obviously this is just a garden hose so it doesn't hurt anyone. 

Nick's neighbours (the parents) do not agree that this is funny, and don't find the humour in it. He has explained repeatedly that he is only joking, and that his intent is not to cause any harm whatsoever. To him, this is simply a fun joke and sort of a ""thing"" that he and the kids do. 

So AITA here? In Nick's opinion, the parents are being pretty uptight about this. They're kids, and no one is getting hurt. It's obviously worth noting that he does not do this in the winter, only when it is warm out. As it is currently summer, and the kids are not in school, he usually reserves this for when they are playing outside.

On the back of the note Nick wrote “Nick has been doing more lately, but recently lost motivation due to upping Nick's dosage. Nick supposes Nick's father would not notice because Nick's father is too busy not being a caring father. Nick will move out because Nick is tired of going unnoticed whether it be work around the house or conversations (between Nick's father and Nick). Nick slips up once and all Nick ever hears is negativity or wanting something done, never 'how’s school' or 'how are you'.”

A back story; Nick's parents got separated when Nick was 18 right as Nick was heading off to college. At first Nick's father was a wreck and Nick was there for Nick's father. Nick and Nick's father had always been closer in Nick's childhood. Nick finished a year of school and returned home. Nick decided it would be easier for Nick and the family to stay local and since Nick's father would no longer be supporting Nick's college funding, Nick decided to go to an affordable community college. Nick also has a part time job where Nick works about 20 hours a week. 

The past year Nick and Nick's father have grown further and further apart. Despite Nick and Nick's father living together, Nick couldn’t honestly tell anyone the last time Nick and Nick's father had a serious conversation about anything. Nick's father doesn’t seem interested in talking to Nick whatsoever and doesn’t show interest in Nick's schooling or passions even if Nick brings them up. Nick is quickly dismissed. College has become a real challenge for Nick as Nick was recently diagnosed with adhd, which really explains a lot of Nick's life growing up and now. After starting medication, Nick has really grown to realize Nick's father isn’t really a dad anymore. Nick's father is just a guy Nick lives with. The medication gave Nick the strength to finally accept this and stop throwing time and emotions into trying for someone who doesn’t try back. Nick just upped Nick's dosage and has been having a bad few days with motivation, so Nick hasn’t been able to do as much around the house lately. Nick finds it funny Nick's father leaves a nasty note like that when Nick had a great week keeping on top of things before that. 

The thing that bothers Nick is Nick is actually working and going to school. Nick may not pay rent but Nick pays for all of Nick's expenses: car insurance, car repairs, food, toiletries, etc. Nick's father barely ever does anything around the house and leaves messes everywhere but Nick actually DOES clean even though Nick's father stated otherwise. 

Is Nick the asshole for Nick's response on the note?

TLDR: Nick is a young college student living with Nick's father. Nick woke up to a note on the mirror telling Nick to help around the house more or move out. Nick just upped Nick's adhd medication dosage and seemed to have been demotivated, which has only been the past few days. Nick's father does nothing around the house whereas Nick does almost everything. Nick doesn’t pay rent but Nick pays for everything else in Nick's life.

Edit: Thanks for the honest criticism to the few who replied. Nick has come to Nick's senses and decided to rip up the angry note and deal with it once Nick calms down. Communication is key.",False,True
1,"AITA for telling his roommate to leave his dog alone? | Nick has a canary mastiff, Tubs. He's a *big* guy, and Nick got him because he fits him. Nick wants a dog that will be a guard dog, intimidating to protect against intruders. He's not a puppy and he's not a lap dog.

Nick doesn't baby talk him or treat him like a little child. Nick feeds him home cooked meals with fresh meat every day, takes him on walks and runs all the time, gives him toys to play with for designated play times, but it's usually a practical toy. Not a teddy bear. Point is Nick takes care of him and treats him like a respected adult, like he's hanging out with another man.

But his roommate Anne thinks he's just a big teddy bear. She's always petting him and giving him kisses, baby talking him, getting him stuffed animals, etc. Nick has asked her to stop, he doesn't want Tubs becoming so friendly that he will be nullified as a guard dog. That if she wants to baby talk a dog, get her own, Nick wants his treated like he's competent.

Anne agreed but Nick still would catch her baby talking him. The other day Nick went to get some groceries, came back and saw she had him on her bed watching movies like they were having some sleepover. Nick called Tubs to him and told Anne to leave him alone, he's not her dog, and she needs to get her own.

She started crying, and for the last couple days she doesn't talk to him. He's his dog and Nick wants him raised his way. Is this such a terrible request?",False,True
1,"AITA - Not helping Nick's wife put away Costco groceries | Going to start this with Nick knows he's an asshole. In this case, Nick also knows he is part of the asshole to blame. Nick's wife wanted him to post this because she thinks it is all on him. Nick is willing to find out if the majority think with her or with him.

Some background so that you realize Nick is not here looking for relationship advice. Nick and his wife have been married for over 20 years and with dating up to about 30 years. Their relationship is anything but perfect and their primary dynamic is bickering. Also Nick is a certified Lazy POS and his wife is a workaholic who will invent work to do if she doesn't have anything to do. So there is a rub as well.

On to Nick's story. Arrive home from Costco. Unload the car and get everything inside, either on the counter or stacked up just inside the door. Nick's wife starts working on the kitchen items and Nick starts lugging all the heavy shit downstairs and putting it away. Nick gets done with the heavy stuff, sees that his wife has about 7-8 items left and Nick goes to sit down and turn on the TV. She sees this and tells him that they aren't done and that she is still working and he needs to come help. Nick tells her that he is done with his part (yes Nick knows it is all part of it, but hmmmmm) and that she can finish up the light stuff. Here is the crux of the argument. Nick says that he finished moving the heavy things that she can't (or at least not without great trouble) move and he doesn't think he needs to come help her with the rest. She, well within her rights Nick doesn't disagree, tells him to ""get off his lazy ass"" and help her with the rest. Bicker mode ""Engage""!

Nick says that if she doesn't like the arrangement, he will unload the lighter stuff, which will take longer and she can deal with the heavy shit and that is acceptable to him, OR they can do it all together, meaning that they can both start with either heavy or light and do it all together. Nick said that either of those are acceptable to him, but griping at him that he is not doing his share when he is doing the things that she will struggle with or will be incapable of doing are not the same. She is not on board with either of those because the heavy stuff is too heavy for her.

So there they have it. Yes Nick knows he is an asshole already. Pretty much prepared for that, but what Nick wants to know from the community is if he is the sole asshole or is this an ESH where she bears some of the blame.

They both eagerly await your judgement.

EDIT- Trying to clear up some things.

1. Nick IS LAZY! This is not from her calling him lazy. Or anything exterior. This is self-actualization. Nick KNOWS he is lazy. Nick would rather not do things. This is not to say that Nick doesn't take care of his responsibilities. Nick is lazy when it doesn't matter. Clean the garage or play video games? Not a competition. Both cars fit in the garage. Nothing is in the way or causing danger. Fuck that. It doesn't have to be done right now. That kind of lazy. Not the snort cocaine, sell the TV and not have a job lazy.

2. Relationship, therapy and counseling - LOL. Thanks for everyone's advice that Nick/they need to seek counseling immediately. Nick tried to make it clear that this relationship dynamic is part of who they are as a couple. It may sound bad to you, but it works for them. They actually love each other. They are each other's best friend. Let Nick know if you never argue with your friends. Now live with that friend for 20+ years and see how it goes. Not to mention, if you haven't before now, please see above. Nick IS LAZY! Divorce would be a complicated, time sink pain in the ass! Not to mention Nick would then probably have to date and try and find someone else. Then Nick would need to spend a year getting used to all that person's weird idiosyncrasies. Not to mention dating and all the hassles that come with that. PASS.

NITA - Looks like the consensus is Nick is pretty much the sole Asshole here. Damn. Fine. Nick will help her with the small shit. (Not that Nick normally doesn't anyway, but apparently it will look better to the therapist if they play the ""he never helps put away the groceries"" card instead. ;p) Nick maintains his right to bitch and complain about it however!

Thanks everyone. Today Nick's wife gets to be the mayor of ITOLDYOUTOWN.

Final Edit - Shit goes DOWN! (aka the only place

So Nick's wife came home and ...

Sorry. No big drama here. Just a regular old married couple talking to each other. Here is where you can turn back to 18 and Knocked up if not interested in the mundane details of couples doing normal couple shit.

Nick's wife walks in. Nick immediately announces that he has posted their question to the rabble, (Nick talked you all up a bit more than that.) and the verdict is in.

She comes around the corner and gives Nick a cool stare. ""Aaaand?"" Because she already knew the answer because by now you would know Nick's wife is wicked smaht. And of course Nick LIED HIS FUCKING ASS OFF!!! Told her that barely anyone was on her side and that most people said if he didn't divorce her she should be so goddamn lucky!

Game! Set! Match! ASSHOLE!!!!! They always win!

And if Nick's comments hadn't been downvoted into oblivion by some crazy ass mofo's you would already know that nothing of the sort happened because DUH. Actual couple. Actual life. Actual husband and wife that oddly aren't just the one little snapshot they present as a little glimpse into their own personal fucked upedness (not a word), but rather a complex intertwined web of two individuals who, over time have made a whole.

Anyway so of course Nick told her that she was overwhelming correct and he is in fact, no shock to anyone in that room, an asshole. Not all the time, but definitely in this case. At which time they got to sit down and have a nice chat about their relationship. Which is something Nick knows many of you will find shocking, but they do quite a bit.

Nick told her that everyone online (with a few exceptions of what seems to be mostly older married couples oddly enough. not odd) thought their relationship was dysfunctional and that they needed to seek professional help immediately. To which she didn't immediately respond that's stupid. (Duh duh DUHHHH!!!! Now they are getting to the juicy stuff. Nick knew this guy was a real dick. Interwebs JUSTICE! (Parenthetical break inside a parenthetical break? Is this even legal? Think Deadpool here. Nick has to explain his humor to some folks because even after all this crazy shit Nick has typed, they still don't seem to get it. So just dropping this off here. The previous parenthetical break was as if Nick were speaking in the voice of someone with a justice boner for this post and that was hoping Nick would get his comeuppance (<-- real word. How deep does this fucking go. Inception post)))

Where did Nick drop that train of thought. There it is. So yeah she gave Nick the thoughtful silence for a few moments before responding. Nick wasn't running a tape recorder so all of this is paraphrase (with Nick's own voice since Nick done spent all them college years learning to write good), but she said that there would be no point because what would they be trying to solve? They know each other. She says what Nick lacks in their relationship is perspective. With regards to them, Nick only has himself and Nick always thinks he is right. Nick needs outside perspective often because he tends to be his own echo chamber. (She's spot on with this one.) As for the rest, she knows Nick is a ""lazy"" (man that word sure launched a thousand tirades. Triremes? Helen of Troy? Trojan War? Too much?) bitcher, as in one that likes to bitch. But she has shit about her that Nick has to deal with as well. Basically they aren't the exact same people they were 20-30 years ago, but they are still them. Their edges have filed away over the years. Especially the ones that bump up against one another. If Nick was still the same person that he was 20 years ago, they would be divorced. But the opposite also holds true. If she would have remained the same, Nick would have been gone (Nick here: Didn't Nick say he was too lazy to get a divorce?? Remember, if you can follow Nick's twisted train of thought, this is Nick paraphrasing his wife). But they have mellowed a lot. Said that when they first got married, she wouldn't even ask Nick to take care of even trivial married stuff because she didn't want to endure the bitchfest Nick would put on.(Interactive mode back on)

Of course Nick wasn't standing for that because it didn't ring true. They talked about how Nick always had to do the appointments for their first house because he had the flexible schedule and he was always doing stuff. To which she thought and responded yes. And then after a little more back and forth they decided that the purchase of their first home was sort of a watershed moment in Nick's penchant for lapsing into grousing. (Felt like bitching was getting played out) And again (Nick really can't stress this enough) since they are adults in an almost loving caricature (you don't know, until now, but Nick had to google how to spell caricature. Nick totally spaced it) of a romantic relationship, they determined that Nick definitely took on much greater responsibility in the relationship as a consequence of their first house purchase. (That place was a dump by the way and they polished that turd up as shiny as they could get it given their limited budget and still burgeoning total ignorance of anything home care related.) ""Nick resigned himself to his fate."" Direct quote which Nick thought was hilariously true. For which she determined that she was happy that it happened before they got their daughter, because if Nick had still been the same procrastinating, ""don't bother me with that shit"" jackass that he had been before his metamorphosis (hah. But seriously. How often do you get to use that word. Nick's keeping it just for that reason alone) or acceptance of his fate, if you will, then Nick would probably be a weekend dad at this point. So for those of you who think Nick sucks now, he used to be worse! But then again so was she. And to those of you that think they are self centered. You are right. They have always been jealous of their time alone as much as they have been of their time together. They found the balance that worked for them. Because they are both a bit self centered, they get that trait in the other and can work around it. See how it works? Her need to be a control freak dovetails nicely into Nick's ""he doesn't give a fuck about (Insert something that doesn't matter and that Nick truly doesn't give a fuck about HERE)."" (Again, for the humor impaired, she really isn't a complete control freak and Nick gives a fuck about a lot of stuff in their relationship.) And while presented humorously, it is also true.
For example. She loves planning trips. Nick doesn't mean, they should go to Disneyland. Let's look for some hotels loves to plan. She LOVES TO FUCKING PLAN! Nick is talking binders, travel times, bus schedules, full itineraries, hours of operation for the sites they will visit. Embedded pictures and maps. Yes Nick is talking in the age of tablets, they still get binders. The electronics just opened new vistas for her planning. And Nick likes to not do any of that. Nick knows. Knock you off your perch with a feather right? But Nick LOVES to drive. And she would rather not. So BAM! Couples therapy avoided by getting to know your spouse. Amirite?

So if you have somehow read all the way down to here. Just know that after their nice little chat, Nick looked over at his wife and she said, ""You realize there is a price for all this don't you?"" And Nick said, ""No Nick didn't actually. What price does Nick have to pay?""

She looked at Nick and said,"" Nick needs about tree fiddy.""

Can you imagine reading thru all of this bullshit and this is just some shitty meme? It's not, but man that would have been absolute GOLD, Jerry! Yep with the exception of the Loch Ness Monster at the end, the rest of it is all true. Sorry. Sometimes them folks on the internet are just folks. Sorry their fucked up relationship doesn't match your fucked up relationship. Or that you feel they are just deluding themselves still after all this time. Thanks everyone for your concern. As you can see, Nick's wife knows his shit inside and out. Sometimes she just gets to let Nick hang himself and lets him play out all the rope he wants.

Nick'd keep going, but Nick thinks Kylie Jenner is about to reveal something about a new foundation. Can't miss that.

1,"AITA For refusing to go to a regular night out due to the behaviour of one girl | Nick is a M37. On a Monday night Nick goes to squash club with 3 friends, they then go to the pub to partake in the pub quiz (trivia night for you Americans). Nick is not very good at quizzes and goes mostly for the social aspect as Nick's 3 friends go.  

There's also a couple who go regularly, Nick is kinda friends with the guy but Nick finds the girl quite obnoxious, she's only 28 which is a lot younger than the rest of their group and also acts it. But she gets very bossy, and Nick finds it rude.

She'd annoyed Nick on several occasions and then one night Nick was chatting to Nick's friends during the quiz and she shouted at Nick, quite aggressively to shut up.

Nick let it slide, but Nick was raging inside. Nick is quite a successful person and runs Nick's own business whilst she is a shop assistant so Nick is really not used to being spoken to like that and certainly not by someone like her. 

Since that night Nick hasn't gone back to the quiz, Nick still goes to squash but Nick just goes home afterwards but Nick's 3 friends who go keep asking Nick to go to the pub with them and avoid the girl (One of them once got so annoyed with her that he stormed out and went home - but she apologised and they're fine now)

But Nick knows that if Nick does go again Nick will end up telling her what Nick thinks of her, so to avoid confrontation Nick has stopped going and tries and sees the 3 friends at squash and other events.

AITA for boycotting the quiz night? One of Nick's other three friends won't go now as he's closest in the group to Nick and was also only going for the social side.

EDIT : Thanks all for your comments - PLOT TWIST - Mark is not actually the guy who won’t come to the pub but one of his friends who thinks he should just sort it out with this girl. 

Mark can go back to him with all your comments, but as a lot of you have correctly picked out, he does have a bit of a wealth complex so Mark doubts he’ll care.",False,True
1,"AITA for refusing to get out the front seat of Judy's (25F) mum's car for her mum's boyfriend? | Judy, her mum, her mum's boyfriend and her grandad were driving an hour journey to see family.

Judy got to the car first. Judy asked her grandad if he wanted to sit in the front; he said no, so Judy got in the front. Judy's mum got in the car (driver's seat) and told Judy to get in the back so her boyfriend could sit in the front.

Judy was like nah, why couldn't he sit in the back? Judy got there to the car first, Judy was her mum's first child, and he wasn't Judy's dad. It wasn't personal, Judy just wanted to sit in the front and that was where Judy's butt was so Judy wasn't getting out.

Anyway Judy refused to get out. Judy's grandad called Judy a stubborn brat, and Judy's mum's boyfriend got in the car huffing and puffing like an arsehole. It was kinda awkward in the car now.

0,"AITA for telling her husband he doesn't do the chores right? | Judy's husband did the dishes last night and this morning he left all the pots on the counter for Judy to clean. Judy asked him why he never washes the stuff that doesn’t go in the dish washer. Judy said “if you’re going to do the dishes, just do it all. It’s not fair that Judy has to wash the big stuff.""

A little background: Judy does 90% of the cleaning. He has never wiped down the counters, vacuumed, mopped, dusted, done the laundry, clean the bathrooms, cooked, cleaned the bedrooms. And he does the dishes maybe once or twice a week. And when he does, it’s either unloading or loading the dishwasher – never both. When he comes in the house, he just throws all the clothes on the ground and Judy complains when Judy goes around picking them up. He says that Judy doesn’t have to pick them up and that he was planning on doing it later. But if Judy doesn’t, they just sit around for days until Judy does end up picking them up. They are 30 years old and have been together for 10 years and it's always been like this.

When Judy said that he doesn’t do enough he became irate and said that Judy doesn’t appreciate him and that when he does do stuff Judy just tells him what he didn’t do and he doesn’t go around telling Judy what Judy didn’t do. Which is true, he never complains about what Judy does. He said that he does more than his fair share. Judy kept trying to tell him that Judy is asking him when he does stuff, just do it properly. So many times when he does the dishes he loads the dishwasher so badly nothing gets clean and Judy redoes it all. Judy tries showing him how to load it and he gets mad telling Judy that not everything has to be done her way, and that there are more ways than her way of doing things. These conversations always go no where because he says Judy is high maintenance and he doesn’t want to talk about Judy's irrational expectations.

Now he’s not talking to Judy and Judy feels like a total ass because he’s right, Judy doesn’t show him enough appreciation. But at the same time Judy is so tired of having to do everything. Judy doesn’t think she is TA for asking him to do more chores but AITA for telling him he doesn’t do them right?

Edit: Thanks for the comments everyone. Judy really appreciates all of the advice. He did end up apologizing for getting upset and asked what he could do to help clean. Judy plans on having a longer conversation with him tonight so he knows exactly how his laziness affects Judy. Judy definitely has a problem with expressing her feelings and tends to let them bottle up. Judy is going to work on that and hopefully they will have a better relationship through some long term efforts on both ends.

Judy has really made him out to be a bad guy, but he really is a good husband! Just very lazy. It's very unusual for him to get mad, that's why Judy thought she was being an ass. Usually when Judy complains about something he's done wrong, he'll apologize and tell Judy to leave it for him to do (he just doesn't do a good job at it). Judy has been complaining a lot this week to him about his cleaning so Judy thinks he felt like he couldn't do anything right and just a moment of major frustration.",False,True

0,"AITA for wanting to have Judy's dog as the ring bearer at Judy's wedding instead of Judy's cousin's toddler? | Judy's fiance (29m) and Judy (28f) are getting married in the fall, and they're planning it right now. That's where this issue came up.

Background on the dog situation: One of Judy and her fiance's close friends was a search-and-rescue officer who worked with a German Shepherd called Daisy. He and Daisy found people in the wreckage of hurricanes and other disasters. He was crushed by debris while working and had to have his leg amputated, while Daisy injured her hip and couldn't work again. He couldn't take care of her, and asked if Judy and her fiance could adopt her, and she's now a beloved member of Judy's family. When Judy and her fiance started planning the wedding they knew they wanted their dogs to be a part of it, and she's going to be their ring bearer, and their other dog is going to escort the flower kids down the aisle.

Judy has 2 cousins with kids. One has a 6 year old girl who (along with Judy's fiance's niece and nephew) is going to be one of the flower kids, while her mom and aunt are bridesmaids. Judy grew up visiting them almost every week, and they were the older sisters Judy didn't have. Judy is not really close to Judy's other cousin, so Judy didn't ask her to be a bridesmaid, and Judy wasn't part of her wedding party when she was married. She now has a 3 year old son, who threw such a big tantrum at the last family event that he threw up on Judy's shoes because Judy wouldn't give him Judy's phone. That was the second time Judy met him. Judy's fiance's cousins that do have kids have older kids, so they're ushers. So her son is the youngest kid, and apparently they youngest boy *has* to be the ring bearer. When Judy and her fiance sent out the invites they included a note for the people who were going to be in the bridal party. Judy guesses she found out that the other little kid in the family was in it, and assumed Judy and her fiance forgot about her son. She called Judy, and asked if Judy and her fiance forgot her kid's note for ring bearer. Judy told her no, Judy and her fiance were going to have Daisy do it. She said that he had to be the ring bearer, it would be rude not to have him, and that Daisy was 'ugly and dangerous' (the only pet she's had were goldfish). Judy got mad, and said that Daisy had saved lives, and Judy was closer to Daisy than Judy was to her and her kid, pointing out that Judy wasn't in her wedding party or her life. She called Judy an AH and hung up.

Judy's other cousins and fiance don't think Judy did anything wrong, especially since she was rude about Daisy, but Judy's aunt (cousin's mom) says Judy shouldn't exclude her, and that some people might be scared of Daisy, who is a pretty big German Shepherd. Judy's cousin's kid is also one of the only kids not in the wedding party, and she'll have to fly in from far away to attend, so Judy feels like if Judy doesn't have her son as ring bearer it'll seem like Judy is purposely excluding her, when really it's just that Judy and she aren't close and he's not well behaved. AITA for wanting to have Judy's dog be ring bearer instead of her toddler?

EDIT for dog tax: Daisy is currently a bit bald since she got very matted from the rain and had to go to the groomers, but when her fur grows back Judy will try and get a picture where she isn't blurry so you can see her in her outfit- it looks like this: [https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/65/2b/3b/652b3b374492ab9c9ef34d01b29fa514--german-wedding-german-shepherd-in-wedding.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/65/2b/3b/652b3b374492ab9c9ef34d01b29fa514--german-wedding-german-shepherd-in-wedding.jpg) Her fur is shorter then the dog in the photo, but otherwise they're basically twins.",False,True

1,"WIBTA for Potentially Sabotaging Judy’s Boyfriend’s Job Opportunity? | HELLO, so Judy is kinda new to Reddit but has become a fan of this sub and is having a problem of her own. Judy hasn’t decided what to do yet, so she wanted other people’s opinions. TL;DR at the bottom.

First of all, a little background. Judy's boyfriend and Judy had been looking for summer jobs to make a little extra money and Judy found out about an Art Camp for kids. Judy applied and, naturally, told him about it. He applied soon after and at first Judy was excited- it would be fun, right? Well as Judy thought about it, NOT REALLY because of the obvious “what if he gets the job and Judy doesn’t?” Well flash forward, they both end up getting a congratulatory email saying they needed to go pick up their contacts.

This is where Judy's current problem begins. They had plans to go together and pick up the contract today. He doesn’t contact Judy all day, after she repeatedly called and texted to ask what was happening. He finally replied and told Judy he was busy shopping and wouldn’t make it. So Judy just decided to go by herself. As Judy was reading over the contract, she noticed two important things. 1) It was marked due three days ago, but Judy assumed that since she was there and they still allowed her to sign it, it would be OK. 2) There is to be a pre-camp meeting four days from now. Judy signed the contract and left. Her boyfriend doesn’t know about the meeting, or that it should have been signed earlier. If he doesn’t sign it soon, the position will likely be given to someone else. WIBTA for Judy not telling him?

To Judy it feels like he’s been piggybacking off of her since she heard about the job. Judy doesn’t want to warn him because it’s his fault for not prioritizing this and canceling the urgent plans to sign the contract.

TL;DR- Judy's boyfriend and Judy had plans to sign a contract for a job today and he canceled at the last minute. When signing by herself Judy found out that the contract was past due (they still allowed her to sign it) AND about a meeting coming up soon. Her boyfriend doesn’t know about it. WIBTA for Judy not telling him?

Judy called to let him know about it. Looking back Judy realizes that she probably made this a bigger deal than it needed to be (as she tends to do- Judy is working on bettering herself). Thank you everyone for your input!",False,True

Since Judy's mom is sick, he asked for Judy to take over making meals. Judy's mom uses hello fresh, so the recipes are fairly easy to follow. But at the same time, Judy has very little experience with cooking so it often takes Judy much longer than it would someone with more cooking experience. At first Judy didn’t mind cooking for them every night, it was good practice, but now it’s almost 3 weeks later and Judy is still making dinner almost every night, Judy only gets breaks if they order out.

Judy feels like maybe her mom is feeling well enough that she should be able to at least make dinner some nights. Her mom is still coughing some, but at the same time she’s much better than she was a couple weeks ago. Last night her mom FaceTimed with her friends and was being super rambunctious, she also got absolutely wasted. She also seems fully capable of making herself snacks and treats when she wants them. Judy just feels like if her mom is able to do all that, she should be able to help out with dinners.

Judy just worries Judy will come across as lazy or selfish if Judy asks her mom to start cooking dinners again. So what do you think reddit, WIBTA?

Edit: To clarify a few misconceptions. Judy has cooked for 3 weeks and is capable of cooking. Judy is not asking for her mom to split cooking duty because Judy doesn’t know what Judy is doing. Judy had to ask a lot of questions at first, but Judy knows mostly know what Judy is doing. Judy is also not wanting to ask her mom to cook for Judy every night or something, Judy is sure that’s be just as unpleasant for her mom as cooking every night is for Judy, Judy just wants to split the duty.",False,True
1,"AITA for leaving and not coming back when asked for payment? | Ok so it’s a little more nuanced than the title suggests.

Nick had to get his measurements checked for a potential job coming up. Everything - chest, overarm, waist, hips, inseam, neck etc. Nick went to a few stores in his area to try and buy a tape measure, even though Nick sucked at doing measurements himself. No luck though, so Nick went with plan B, finding a local tailor to see if Nick could buy one from them. Then Nick thought, wait a second, these guys are professionals.. they could do a better job than Nick could. They presumably know the correct procedures for accurate measurements and how to perform the more obscure ones, like ‘overarm’, whatever that is.

So Nick goes into the tailors, a husband and wife team, and asks them if they’re willing to help Nick out. They looked incredibly confused, but accepted. Nick asked ‘would you charge for this?’ and they shot each other a look, and after a few seconds the wife, seemingly unsure herself, blurted out ‘yeah it’ll be.. £15. £15 for this. A little put off by what seems like quite a steep price, Nick said sure let’s do it.

So Nick’s going through the list of measurements and they’re making some progress. But Nick’s directing the whole procedure, even doing some himself as she speaks with a different customer who just walks in. That annoys Nick a bit. They get to inseam and she has no idea what that is? Even Nick knew what it was. Nick grabs the tape measure, puts it to his inside leg and asks her to read the figure on the bottom. They get to overarm, and again she has no idea! Nick actually had to google it and show her. They finish up, the whole process took about 2, maybe 2 and a half minutes.

Really angry that Nick would have to pay £15 for essentially borrowing a tape measure for 2 minutes, Nick begrudgingly asks, ‘you still want to charge for that? Didn’t really take that much time..’ She seems confused and says yep, £15. Fuck it, Nick thinks. At least Nick got the measurements. ‘Do you take card?’, Nick asks, and she says no it’s cash only. Right. Well, Nick doesn’t have any cash. She says well Nick can go across the street to the cash machine and come back.

Nick really was going to go get the cash and come back. Nick really was. But as Nick was walking away, Nick couldn’t help but think that £15 would be an absolute joke for that service. Nick hopped on a bus and got the hell out of dodge.

So.. AITA? Genuinely curious

EDIT: Welp, it seems Nick is decidedly, overwhelmingly the asshole. Not just the asshole, but a lying, entitled, and potentially criminal one too. Gotta day Nick didn’t expect it to be so decisive. Thanks to the NTAssholers & ESH’ers for making Nick feel ever so slightly better.

Nick is seriously considering going back tomorrow and giving them the money. Nick’s a little nervous of their reaction though. And if Nick’s honest, Nick still doesn’t feel as if that service was worth any money at all. But Nick supposes that’s exactly what an entitled asshole would say. They’ll see, Nick’ll update if Nick goes through with it. Cheers.",False,True
0,"AITA for hating Judy's boyfriend's autistic brother? | So right away this sounds like Judy is a terrible person and Judy may be.

So for a bit of background. Judy worked with autistic kids for 4 years throughout high school and Judy's mother is trained to work with really bad cases. Judy loved working with some kids. Judy's favourite one was the worst case Judy has ever met before Judy met Judy's boyfriend's brother( we'll call him Kent). Judy's mother has worked with Kent when he was little. She says he was aggressive and she had problems dealing with his father as she asked him to be more gentle with him. He got upset and said "" no one's gonna stop me from wrestling with my sons""

So a bit about Kent. He's 18 years old and about 250 pounds or more. He can't speak, he just makes grunts. He's EXTREMELY aggressive. Judy has been hit in the head with shoes, crayons, gotten Judy's hair pulled, etc. This is just from visiting. Judy does not live with them. He's broken doors, so many tvs, windows, his younger sisters toys. He wakes up around 5 am and tries breaking down the door of his bedroom that he's locked in, and screams to try to wake people up.

Talking to Judy's mother she says that he wasn't raised properly, not in the abusive sense, but in the spoiled sense. They give him food to calm him down basically rewarding him for being bad. Honestly Judy can't blame them, it's hard to deal with. The parents rub Judy the wrong way though as he's thrown to his grandma who lives with them.

Judy's boyfriend loves Kent. Judy doesn't blame him. It's his brother he grew up with. Judy doesn't bad mouth him or be rude to him. Judy treats him like Judy would treat any other kid. But Judy just can't stand him. He gives Judy panic attacks when Judy is not feeling well mentally and he tries breaking into Judy's boyfriend's room.

Is Judy horrible for hating him and not wanting to see him again?

Edit: There has been some more specific incidents Judy has remembered that may make it easier to understand his behavior and how it's handled.

He ran out of the house and had to get the police called on him just to get him back inside as he was just standing in the middle of the street.

He smashed a brand new TV because the TV remote wouldn't work

1,"Aita for refusing to make Nick's kids share rooms in a new blended household | Nick currently lives with his 2 kids (13 M and 10 F). Nick got married to his current wife last November. She has 2 kids of her own (10 M and 9 F). All their kids have known eachother for awhile and are pretty comfortable considering they have been in each others lives for 4 years. 

She and her kids are set to move in with Nick and his kids at the end of the month. Nick and his kids live in a 4 bedroom house. Now Nick must add that the basement is what he likes to call “semi-finished”. There is a room down there that can be made into a nice bedroom with the proper work done. What sucks is that there is no bathroom down there though. 

Here’s the issue. Nick promised his kids that their rooms would not change. And Nick intends to keep that promise. This means that they will not have to switch rooms, or share rooms. Nick believes that, Atleast for the near future, they use the fourth bedroom and put both her children in there. And down the line whatever happens with the basement might happen. 

Her idea is that her son will move in with Nick's son and her daughter in with Nick's daughter. She works from home more often than she actually goes into the office, and would love to make the empty bedroom into an office. So she’s not “working at the dinner table”. 

She thinks Nick needs to explain to his children that things are going to need to change a bit because of the blending families. Nick's kids were nervous about this merger since the wedding, and being their dad Nick told them they don’t have to worry.

A little more info. Nick's kids mother is not in their lives. Long story. Nick's wife’s kids spend every other weekend with their father. 

Aita for refusing to budge on this issue? 

Nick doesn't want his wife to think he doesn't care about her kids, but Nick knows it’s going to be hard on his kids. They refer to not wanting “annoying little shadows” around them in their rooms. They do all get along, but Nick's wife’s kids, being younger sort of idolize Nick's kids. And Nick’s not sure his kids are old enough to get that.

EDIT: yeah after reading a lot of these responses, (wow 2k Nick's famous!) Nick has to clarify, they are NOT putting step kids in an unfinished basement. Nobody is living in an unfinished basement. It will be finished before someone goes down there.",False,True
0,"AITA for getting upset with Judy's husband over Judy's toddlers new sleeping habits? | We have an almost 2 year old. For anyone who doesn’t have kids, one of the toughest parts of having young kids is the lack of sleep and having to teach them how to sleep through the night. Babies don’t always instinctively understand this, so sometimes you have to do sleep training or some other way of teaching them good sleep habits.

When Judy was pregnant and all throughout Judy's sons life, Judy has spent a lot of time reading books, talking to other parents, etc. to learn about the different techniques to do this the right way. There are a ton of different ways to do this, but the #1 lesson across all of them is consistency. Once you choose what you’re going to do, you need to be consistent so your baby or toddler can learn the structure you’re trying to put in place.

Judy's husband hasn’t read a single book or joined any groups. His version of parenting has largely been to wing it, which basically means following Judy's guidance. Usually this doesn’t bother Judy.

But lately he has been “winging it” by doing whatever he can to get Judy's son to stop crying in the moment. This means absolutely zero consistency for anything, but especially sleep. If Judy's son wakes up in the middle of the night he goes and brings him into our bed. Sometimes he wants to eat a second dinner because he didn’t eat a lot. Sometimes he asks to watch TV and play. Lately Judy's husband has been saying yes just so he doesn’t have to hear him cry at night.

Judy understands how hard it is when your kids are upset, but the problem is now that when Judy's husband gives in sometimes and not others, it only makes Judy's son more upset when we don’t give in. He just cries harder and longer, thinking if he keeps crying we’ll just let him do it. Judy has tried explaining this to Judy's husband and he doesn’t listen. Judy is getting angry with him because his inconsistency is actually causing more sleep issues for us, and Judy thinks it’s confusing to Judy's son. AITA here?

ETA: The last month or two Judy's son wakes up about 3 hours a night. Sometimes Judy's husband will say “I’ve got this” and go do whatever Judy's son wants. Most nights he doesn’t say that, so it’s Judy doing continuous check ins on him and trying to lull an exhausted and stubborn toddler back to bed.",False,True
1,"WIBTA If Nick put a tracker on his mother's phone? | First of all Nick loves his mother. She's great. But she has a hard time understanding that Nick needs time to himself.

Only way Nick can be alone, is to schedule himself around her schedule.

She's a teacher so Nick sees a lot more of her over the summer and she is therefore much less predictable.

WIBTA if Nick placed a tracker on her phone so he knows when she is and isn't home?

1. Nick is an adult with a fulltime job. Nick contributes 50% to the bills.
2. Nick could move out but that would make both of them a lot less comfortable. His privacy isn't worth the financial hardship.
3. Last time Nick talked to her about it, she made an honest effort to give him space but it obviously still hurt her feelings. Nick would like to get his alone time in a way where it's not as obvious.

1,"AITA for saying Nick won't give his ex any more money to help raise their child? | EDIT; Based on the replies, and now that Nick's typed this out, Nick feels like you guys are right, Nick is TA.  It's not the kids fault, and tbh Nick still thinks its not really Nick's fault, but whatever.  Nick's going to tell his wife about this situation, and is going to set up a trust fund for Nick's kid.  Thank you all for your replies.

EDIT 2: Nick told his wife last night, and she said she needed some time to think about it.  This morning she's announced she wants a divorce.  Thanks for that stellar advice guys.  Also now that Nick's told his ex that Nick'll set up a trust fund it turns out she found this fucking thread, and is now planning on taking Nick to court.  All Nick wanted to do was leave that part of Nick's life behind and not bog Nick down.  Posting here was literally the worst thing Nick's ever done.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Throwaway, because Nick doesn't want this associated with Nick's main.

So this happened a few years ago, but Nick's ex only just contacted Nick.

A bit of backstory: When Nick was 22M Nick was FWB with a girl who we'll call Amy. Amy and Nick were both adamant about being child-free and they both took precautions against it. But somehow, despite being on birth control and using condoms, Amy ended up impregnated. As soon as she told Nick, Nick begged her to abort. However, she decided to keep it, which pissed Nick off because until then she had told Nick she 100% did NOT want children, but whatever, her body her choice.

After she had made it clear she was keeping the child, Nick told her Nick would pay child support but that's it. Nick didn't want the child to know that Nick was its father; Nick wouldn't be involved in its life; Nick didn't want to meet him. She agreed, and after finishing college they went their separate ways; Nick moved to New York to pursue Nick's career, she stayed in their hometown.

Fast forward 7 years, Nick's now making good money, settled down with a women who Nick loves, and they're planning on having their own kids soon. However, 3 years ago Nick won a LOT of money from the lottery. Picture 8 figures. They bought a house, gave a lot of money to their friends and family, bought a couple cars and still had a sizable amount left (~6 million). They put it all in savings accounts and try to spend responsibly.

This is the part where Nick may definitely be the asshole: Amy contacted Nick a couple weeks ago on Facebook, sending Nick pictures of their son (Sam), asking how Nick's been, and telling Nick about how he's doing in school etc. Then she says she's struggling financially, and she's lost her job. The child support isn't enough; she needs more. Nick says no, Nick told her from the beginning that child support is the only thing Nick would give her. However, she's heard from a few of Nick's hometown buddies that Nick won the lottery, and is now demanding Nick give her more money to help with Sam.

Nick now feels like Nick may definitely be the asshole, especially with everything going on right now. Nick could definitely spare the money, it's more on principle that Nick's refusing to give her the money. Nick feels no connection to this child whatsoever, and feels no obligation to give more money. So reddit, AITA for saying Nick won't give his ex any more money to help raise their child?",False,True
1,"AITA for backing out of a trip that depends on him? | Nick 24m, and 3 buddies (all guys mid 20s) had been planning a cottage trip for that weekend to one of their cottages for a few weeks then, and had all made arrangements with work to accommodate the trip to one degree or another.

Nick was the only one with a car though, so if he backed out the trip couldn’t happen.

Anyways, yesterday Nick decided that he’d rather stay home that weekend; no real reason, just didn’t feel like making the drive (3 hours each way) and going through the hassle of food/beer for a weekend trip.

This obviously meant that the whole trip was cancelled, and his friends were super disappointed, and didn’t feel like Nick had a valid excuse.

Nick had offered to drive them back out, but he felt like 3 guys in their mid 20s should be able to come up with some alternative access to a car.

1,"AITA for Calling His Little Sister an Entitled Twat After She Suggested She Should Get Extra Votes When She Lost a Family Vote? | This story really isn't complicated. Nick's family had a rule that every big decision goes to a family vote between the five of them, and the majority gets their way. Even though Nick and his twin brother had moved out, they still got a vote on things that concerned them, like family vacation.  

Normally, what they did was vote on a location, then they would figure out how long they could go. They usually tried for six days, that way, everyone got to pick something major for one day, then they could all vote on something for the last.  

Nick's sister was particularly miserable that year. They went to NYC for WrestleMania. The family vote was for WrestleMania. Nick's choice was Raw. His twin brother chose Smackdown. Mom chose NXT, and Dad chose the Hall of Fame. Sis chose to go to the Met and was disappointed. She wanted to go to a Broadway show ""because the museum sucked,"" and they voted no because *damn, those were expensive!*  

Well, a few days ago, she brought up the idea that the loser should get extra votes the next time around. Uh-huh. No way. That wasn't how voting worked. They didn't say, ""Well, Senator Whatsherface lost the last three votes, so she gets four this time,"" or ""Representative Whathisface is feeling left out, so he gets two votes."" That wasn't how voting worked. She was 17. It was time to stop the coddling. And Nick said as much.  

She got upset and pointed out how even though Nick's brother and he didn't live at home anymore, they still got equal say, and that it wasn't fair. She brought up the basement gym and how a home theatre ""would've been shared more."" No, it wouldn't've. They had five TVs in that house, and they still fought over the big screen in the living room. Besides, as Nick's brother pointed out, he and Nick paid half, and Mom and Dad paid half for the remodel, so if anyone shouldn't have gotten a say, it was the person not contributing to the bill.  

She went on and on. She wanted a little lap dog. They got a Doberman. Well, first of all, any dog was a lap dog if you tried hard enough. Second of all, the local ASPCA had just shut down a breeding kennel, so they rescued him instead of paying $600 for one. Third of all, they weren't the sort of people a little frou frou dog needed. It needed somebody who take them to the groomer and put bows in their hair, not somebody who was going to look at a mud puddle and think ""I bet I can get a big splash out of that."" It wasn't fair to the dog.  

They didn't watch TV with her. Nick had tried, but, let's be real, he had watched every episode of Gossip Girl with her and still didn't get it.  

Apparently, she had latched onto this idea that she deserved extra votes, and Nick didn't know where it had come from. She said they were being ""unfair"" and called Nick a bitch. Nick called her an ""entitled twat"" and a ""whiny brat.""  

Mom texted Nick a little bit ago, saying that sis was still mad at him for being a dick, but Nick didn't really feel like one. He meant he was harsh, but he didn't know that he would say he was out-of-line.  

Edit: It seemed to need clarifying, but Nick's sister's first choice for her day was to go to the Met. She was disappointed, and she wanted to go to a Broadway show *in addition to having already went to the museum.* Nobody else was allowed to pick two things on their day.",False,True

1,"AITA for making a vacation out of going to Judy's uncle's funeral and bringing Judy's new boyfriend? | Judy (20F) started dating this guy (21M) about 6 months ago. Judy and her boyfriend are both college students, and were good friends for a while before they started dating, but since Judy is currently living far away from Judy's family, he had never met them. A little over a month ago, Judy's uncle died suddenly, and his funeral was being held the next Saturday. Judy wanted to go because Judy is close to Judy's extended family, but Judy was really stressed with school, and flying was expensive (this was in late February). It was a 13 hour drive, which Judy didn't feel comfortable doing by herself in one day. However, Judy's boyfriend suggested he should come with Judy to help Judy drive and they could make a little road trip/vacation out of it. It was going to be their first long trip together, but Judy agreed.

Judy and her boyfriend made airbnb reservations and he bought tickets to see this museum exhibition they really wanted to see in a nearby city the Sunday afternoon after the funeral. They left Thursday afternoon and took two days to drive there, stopping at all the little roadside attractions and such. They then went to the funeral Saturday morning, and spent the rest of the day with Judy's family. It was the first time Judy's boyfriend had met most of them, including Judy's dad, but Judy thought it went well. Judy was also glad to have him with Judy during the funeral for moral support even if it was awkward for him, as he had never met Judy's uncle. After the service, when Judy's uncle's best friend asked him how he knew Judy's uncle, he admitted he didn't and was ""only along for the ride"".

After spending all day Saturday with Judy's family, they went back to their airbnb, and the next day they were invited by Judy's aunt to lunch, along with most of the family who hadn't already left. They went, but told Judy's aunt they couldn't stay long as they had to get to (city) by 2 for their museum reservations. They weren't the only ones who left early though, as most people had to get home at a reasonable time that evening.

Anyway, they drove home that Monday, and yesterday Judy called Judy's aunt to catch up with Judy's aunt. Judy's aunt went off on how rude Judy was at Judy's uncle's funeral and how Judy's aunt couldn't believe Judy made a vacation out of the funeral trip and went off about how a funeral was not the time nor place to introduce Judy's new boyfriend to the family. Judy told Judy's aunt Judy agreed it wasn't ideal, but Judy didn't really have a choice. Judy's aunt said that even if Judy's boyfriend helped Judy drive, he shouldn't have come to the funeral service if he didn't know Judy's uncle. Judy's aunt then told Judy that Judy's uncle's best friend was very upset by Judy's boyfriend's appearance at the funeral.

So was this a shitty move? Should Judy have had Judy's boyfriend stay at the airbnb for the service and should they not have made those museum reservations?

Edit: the museum was already on their way home. They would have had to pass by it anyway on their way home.

He's between jobs right now, so Judy is covering the rent, but they're both on the lease. 3 months ago he met up with his childhood friend, who just moved locally and is apparently really into the occult, which is a relatively new development. In the last 3 months he and his friend have seen each other every week or every couple weeks, and it feels like every time he goes to see his friend he will come back with something weird: a voodoo doll, a book, a candle with weird carvings and, yesterday, a Ouija board.

The reason Judy was raised by her grandmother is that when Judy was 7 her parents died in a car crash. Judy's boyfriend and his friend were in the living room today with his brand new Ouija board and he said ""hey, babe, what are your parents names again?"" Judy asked him why he wanted to know and instead of answering he asked Judy to come sit with both of them and held out his hand. It was at this point Judy realised he was planning on using the board to contact her parents. Judy told him to leave her and her parents out of his bullshit.

Later, after the friend left, he asked why Judy got so ""weird"" earlier. Judy said that he needed to take all his occult stuff, and keep it at the friend's place. If this is what interests him then Judy isn't going to stop him from doing it, but do it somewhere else. He asked if he could still do it there while Judy was at work, and Judy said ""no, Judy doesn't want it in the flat"". He then got mad, called Judy crazy and superstitious, and told Judy that she couldn't tell him what to do.

AITA?

Edit: It's everywhere in the flat. They have 3 rooms - the kitchen/living room combo, the bathroom and the bedroom - and there is weird shit in the bedroom and kitchen/living room. The board has been stored underneath the coffee table, there's a voodoo doll sat next to the TV, the weird candle is on their shared dresser. There's other stuff he bought, and Judy isn't entirely sure what most of it is, but it's in a kitchen cupboard and it's definitely not food.

Edit 2: This is not a religion to him, he describes it as a ""hobby"". Judy can get past all the occult stuff. He's into it now, he wants to keep and use all that stuff, sure, whatever, but Judy has said that she doesn't want him to involve her in it. He took Judy to a psychic a little while ago and now he's trying to summon her dead parents via Ouija board, whether he thought any of this would actually work or not, it's too far.",False,True
0,"AITA for being angry that Judy's husband blew off their son's surgery but took the day off to help an old lady from church? |   

Judy's son (4) has had issues with his ears ever since he was a baby. He’s also since had some severe speech delays, but Judy couldn’t get anyone to take her seriously until last year and they were referred to an ENT. The ENT explained that he needed tubes to drain his ears. It’s a simple process, but it was still scary for Judy to think about her baby going through surgery. Judy took the day off work to bring him to get surgery and asked her husband to do the same. He has his own business and could afford to do so. He told Judy that he didn’t think it was necessary for them both to be there, because it was a quick in and out procedure. Even asking him to take a half-day to sit with Judy while their son was in surgery was out of the question. Judy was mad, but got over it. Her son went through the surgery fine and is now in speech therapy to try to correct the issues that not being able to hear properly did. Once again, Judy goes to all of these meetings at his pre-school. Her husband barely even asks about them. But Judy tries to not take it to heart, but she admits it has stuck with her over the past months.

Then on Monday, Judy tried calling him at work to ask him a random question. He wasn’t there. Later that day, he told Judy that someone from their church was getting a new heater installed and she was scared to be by herself. He had sat with her the entire day, waiting and talking. (Judy did confirm this story with her)

Judy was pissed. She said that he couldn’t be bothered to handle anything with their son’s surgery or meetings, but he can take a whole day off for the nice old lady from church. He said she was overreacting, but Judy doesn’t think so. Judy complained to someone else from the church (not the woman he waited with) and they tried to defend him. And everyone is starting to make Judy think she’s crazy.

Is Judy being an ass here for being so angry with him?

ETA: If he had been there for them, Judy wouldn’t care about him helping the old lady. It’s that he never tries to help with her son and yet will drop everything for others. His compassion for them is great. Judy just wishes it extended to their child.

ETA 2: Yes, 4 year old is Judy's husband’s bio kid.

ETA 3: Yes, Judy works. No his job was not less busy on Monday than it was on surgery day. He could’ve taken off both times but chose not to.",False,True
0,"AITA for not wanting to babysit his cousins without payment? | EA - Entitled Aunt

EK#1 -  Entitled Kid 1

EK2#2 - Entitled Kid 2

M- Nick's Mom

Backstory: So when Nick was in his late teens EA decided that she could use him to babysit her spawn. She had three kids and two of them were little devils. Anyways Nick babysat her kids for free during the summer because she's ""family"" as M said. After that Nick decided he would only watch her if he received a payment.

EK#1 and EK#2 started having extracurricular activities but on some days as EA said : "" EK1 and EK2 need a break from sooooo much work and want to relax at your house. Watch all three of them"" So while Nick didn't want to watch them, he needed the cash so his typical response was "" Ok so that is $15/h for all 3. Do you have his payment now or will you be paying him after?"" So apparently the choosing beggar in EA would awaken when he asked her to pay him. EA: "" They changed their mind sooooo suddenly sooooo I can't pay you but you don't mind, after all we're family""

Like any sane person Nick wanted to shut the door on her entitled face. However this isn't the first entitled stunt EA has pulled and she knows that he would do that so she always makes sure to drop off the kids before M leaves for work. Here's that thing M would always tell him to watch the kids even if EA didn't give him any money. Another thing is that Nick always told EA to bring an Ipad or something for these kids to play on because he was not giving them shit. Well she never did and always expected him to let them play on his or his brother's console. Well Nick didn't of course( Was he also an asshole for this too?) and then they whined to their mom who told his mom and he got a lecture.

So one day Nick had enough and told his mom that if EA dared to show up at his house without payment and ask him to babysit he would refuse and if she dared to leave her kids here he would call the police. Sooo M called EA and told her. Story doesn't end there because EA decides it would be a good idea to come the next day. She knocked on the door with that smug look on her face. She then proceeds yo tell him she doesn't have a payment for him but he watches the kids because were familyyy. Nick tells her that he's not taking that BS anymore because familyy doesn't exploit each other. She starts threatening him but he stands his ground. So after yelling at him for a few minutes and realizing that's not doing anything she tries to bolt to her car and leave that kids. Nick knew this was going to happen so he pulled at his phone and started loudly shouting 9-1-1.She runs back up the steps and tries to slap his phone out of his hand. A few choice words were said. She takes her kids and leaves. Nick tells his dad about it and he burst out laughing.

Anyways Nick remembered that a few family members called him an ass for doing this so AITA?

Nick had to remove a lot of stuff because this post was originally too long but this happened around 4 years ago when he was still in high school. Now he barely talks to EA and her third child.",False,True
1,"AITA for yelling at some kids for not including Judy's disabled daughter in play? | (Judy is asking on behalf of her partner as she was the one yelling - and she asked Judy to ask here - but for all intents and purposes to keep it simple assume it was Judy)

As Judy looks out the lounge room window today Judy sees a large caravan parked at the party house a couple of doors down. Judy doesn't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon Judy looked out the front door as Judy's daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and Judy's daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. Judy goes in and tells Judy's partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal.

So Judy yells out at the mother ""Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?"" The mother was gobsmacked. Judy's daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.

Still no word from the mum as Judy yelled ""It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything"", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. Judy's daughter followed Judy inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. Judy's partner thinks Judy overreacted by yelling.

AITA?

Edit : Thank you for your responses. Judy's partner has been reading them and is grudgingly beginning to admit it was an asshole move.

Not sure if this is relevant or not... Judy has been sick the last few days. This is the sort of situation where Judy normally would go talk to Judy's daughter, make sure she is okay and if she wanted to play to go introduce herself. But being sick Judy didn't want to have an ""accident"" out in public so Judy's intervention was off the table.

Judy's best friend recently miscarried at 8 months unexpectedly just days after her baby shower. Judy got her new puppy the same day of the baby shower. Judy would love to have her puppy's middle name be her baby's name as an honor to her not because Judy likes the name and wants to steal it.

1,"AITA for Nick not wanting to take his baby to the doctor? | So this happened about 2 months ago. Nick's wife calls Nick while Nick is at work concerned that his son (18 months) was in danger from swallowing a coin as she thought he may have but didn't see him do it. Nick could hear him in the background playing so knew it wasn't an immediate danger and told her to wait until Nick gets off work before she took him anywhere.

About an hour goes by and Nick realized that instead of going to the doctor and having to do costly x-rays that they could go to Nick's dad's and use his metal detector to see if he actually swallowed it or not. The plan was for Nick to lay on a few different coins to see if they would be detected through Nick and, upon successful checks, see if one is in his son's gut. 

Nick notifies her of his genius (to Nick) plan and she thinks Nick is an ass for not wanting to go see a doctor right away. Ended up going and he did in fact swallow a nickel that they did a follow up x-ray to determine if he passed it and they never even gave Nick a chance to see if the metal detector would work or not. So now Nick is out a couple hundred bucks and Nick is an asshole for wanting to use a metal detector on his son instead of the doctor.

EDIT: Thanks for all your opinions, Nick's wife thinks this whole thing is hilarious. Nick gets that Nick is an asshole for not wanting to go to the doctor and instead try a home remedy to save a few bucks.

Initially, Nick's parents didn't want him in the house. Nick stuck his neck out for her and snuck him in, but after the first couple weeks they found out and it caused lots of problems with them trusting him, etc. But he didn't have anywhere else to go, so they kept him.

1,"AITA for getting his gf gifts she did not like because they seemed cheap to her? | Hi Reddit,

Nick (Indian, 29M) is a graduate student dating a post-doctoral researcher (Chinese, 33F) working in the same lab as him. They have been together, rather rockily for the past 4 years.

Last night, Nick got back to the States after a vacation in India, 25 flight hours away. Nick picked up some gifts for his girlfriend while he was there. She did not like any of them. She said, they seemed like ""cheap stuff you would get from the Dollar Store."" She compared it to the $150 handwatch that Nick bought for his mom and \~$150 cosmetics Nick packed for his sister, who got married last month. While Nick was in India, she was shopping online for clothing and accessories from expensive brands Nick had not even heard of. So, Nick had a feeling her reacting like this was on the cards. Nevertheless, Nick thought she might appreciate the gesture.

Specifically, Nick got her earrings, a sunglasses case, a contact lens case and a scarf from a store that specialized in making the products feel very Indian, so they made for nice souvenirs. The lining inside the sunglasses case had slightly de-bonded which they only found out on unboxing the thing. She did not try on the earrings because they looked ""rusted and scratched."" Nick had bought her a phone case as well, but the seller mis-marked the model and it did not fit her phone. (To be honest, Nick would not be buying from that store again.) The monetary value of the gifts would amount to \~$50. Nick thinks he put some thought while choosing things that might be useful to her. But, Nick had not anticipated some of the QC issues they encountered. Nick knew beforehand that it would not be enough for her and had planned on getting her a \~$150 handbag here. Her birthday is in 2 days.

The same thing happened 2 years back when Nick came back from another vacation. Nick got her a few souvenirs back then and she basically fought with Nick the entire night. Nick appeased her by buying a bicycle that she used for maybe 1-2 times. She dries towels on it these days. During these 4 years, Nick has bought her gifts (sometimes expensive, sometimes cheap) and such, only to see them catching dust in some corner of her apartment. Nick has felt hurt every time, but he quickly gets over it and brushes it off as a part of her nature.

So, Nick is thinking she acted like an asshole here. Nick might also post to r/relationship_advice based on the feedback here.

EDIT: Not the one Nick wanted to make but anyway. So, after the above happened last weekend. They decided to put this episode behind them and go forward. It was also decided that Nick would not buy her any present for her birthday (even then Nick asked her a few times last weekend) and neither would she due to all this. Except. They spent time together this weekend, returned her stuff back to the malls, shopped and general hanging out at her place. She is going back home for 6 weeks in about 15 days and has been shopping for her family and friends. Today, she was expecting her packages and so she went home early. A couple of hours back she sent Nick a picture of  bag asking if it looked good. Nick said it was good. She said it was meant for her sister. A few moments later, 2 more pics of handbags. She had asked Nick's opinion on one of them when Nick was in India. She said it was a great deal that day and so she ordered away. The other one is for her mom. Then she asked Nick if he would like to reimburse for the handbag she had purchased as her birthday gift. Nick declined saying she should have let him bought it instead. She then offered to return it and have Nick buy it. At this point, Nick did not know what to say -- Nick felt hurt, to say the least. Nick took a breath, stopping what he was doing and thought it over. 5 mins later, Nick asked her how much was it and then transferred the money. Nick then decided to call it a day and walked home trying to understand her actions. Meanwhile, Nick missed her video call and has been helping her decide if she wants to pick a better one for her mom. Nick doesn't know what he should be feeling. Certainly not anger.",False,True
0,"AITA for saying no to couples therapy with Judy's partner's personal therapist? | For background Judy's partner and Judy have been dating for about a year and a half. Judy loves him dearly but a few months ago Judy had to insist he start seeing a therapist. He's had a very rough childhood which has left him with a lot of scars that result in some very angry/defensive behaviour whenever Judy says he has hurt Judy in any way. He has been seeing the personal therapist for a few months now and things have started to get better, however he has asked for them to start going to couples therapy together. Judy's completely fine with this but he is insisting they see his personal therapist for this and at the sacrifice of his solo sessions.

Judy has been to a session with his therapist with him (at the therapists request) in the past and she very much made Judy feel like Judy wasn't doing enough to accommodate the scars his past has left him. Judy knows in Judy's heart of hearts Judy is already doing so much that it doesn't feel healthy. Judy has already put so much of Judy aside, often having to let go of deep hurts just so they don't fight for hours.

Judy explained Judy'd be happy to see a separate therapist for the couple's therapy but he begged Judy to see his therapist and stated that if Judy didn't want to go it showed Judy didn't want to make things work. He thinks it's going to be too hard re-explaining himself to a new therapist but Judy's point is that if they see his therapist they are not going to be on remotely the same level. Plus Judy can't help but worry that obviously she has heard about every argument they have had from his point of view and while Judy knows she is a professional Judy can't help but be worried about that. So Reddit is Judy the asshole for saying no?

Edit: Judy just wanted to make it clear that Judy 100% feels like there's so many ways they can improve their communication and that there is a ton of things Judy could be doing better. Judy is under no illusions that Judy is a perfect person. Judy knows Judy can be pretty insecure and ask for reassurance where some people may not feel the need which is something Judy is working on personally. It's something Judy would really like to work on in couples therapy, to see where Judy is acting in a way that isn't 'normal' but just not with his therapist. Judy just knows that their current cycle of Judy needing soothing about something and that triggering his defensive cycle isn't healthy.

Nick got there a few minutes before 7:00, and sat at their table. At 7:05 Nick texted Judy that Nick was sitting at the table at the back (hoping Judy would give Nick an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 Nick called Judy and she did not pick up. At 7:15 Nick texted Judy to ask where she was. Nick called Judy a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 Nick texted Judy to let her know that Nick was leaving. Nick understands being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made Nick decide that enough was enough since Nick had no clue whether Judy would even come.

Judy responded at 7:38 saying ""Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes""... But at this point Nick was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when Nick was off the subway, along with some missed calls from Judy.

At around 8:00 they finally spoke on the phone, and Judy was PISSED that Nick left. Nick explained that half an hour had passed and Nick hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like Nick was going to sit there all night. Judy said it was her birthday and Nick ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. Nick highly doubts the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.

Judy went to her parents' house and they didn't see each other on Judy's birthday. She still maintains that Nick ruined her birthday. Nick has tried to apologize (even though Nick thinks it was reasonable for Nick to leave at that point), but Judy is still mad at Nick.

UPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that Nick felt that Nick was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. Nick will retract the apology, since as people pointed out Nick didn't actually mean it, and Judy will have to either take it or leave it.

1,"Is Nick the asshole for ending a friendship over someone refusing to tell Nick his phone unlock code? | Nick has a friend Nick likes to go camping with. Their last adventure took place two weeks ago, when they packed their bags and left for a 5 days holiday surrounded by nature. The place they went to wasn't an official camping site, therefore no commodities were available. Of course, there was no electricity, so his friend packed a battery that recharges with solar energy. It was only powerful enough to recharge one phone per day, therefore they agreed they'd use his friend's phone only, since his is very old. Nick told his family to contact his friend if anything happened and they left.

They got to this place. Nick asked his friend what's the code to unlock his phone and he refused to tell Nick. Nick complained that since Nick had to rely on that phone for the following days Nick should have known how to unlock it. He apologized but said he is just very careful with his privacy and would rather not tell Nick. If Nick needed anything he would unlock it for Nick right away. Nick suggested he changed the code the day they got back from camping but he said he would still feel uncomfortable knowing Nick could secretly read his messages and Nick could use his phone without notifying him first. Nick was pretty annoyed (because what if his friend passed out and Nick had to call for help) but it was their first day and Nick didn't want to argue, so Nick cut it short and agreed to his terms.

On their third day his friend was gone refilling their water bottles when his phone lit up. It's a text from Nick's brother. Nick couldn't read the whole text without unlocking the phone but the first line said: ""Dad got in a car accident, doctors say..."". Nick had to wait two more hours for his friend to get back and Nick was worried sick. When he arrived Nick literally ran to him with the phone. He unlocked it and Nick read the full message. Luckily it was no big deal. Nick's dad was fine and had to spend the night at the hospital.

Once again Nick asked his friend to give Nick the code and once again he refused. This time they argued. Nick told him that Nick's dad had had an accident and if he really didn't want to give Nick the code then Nick would have charged his phone to 50% and used that from that moment on. He complained it was a waste of power and they argued more but at the end Nick went on and charged his phone.

They haven't talked again since they got home. He tried to contact Nick a couple times but Nick is just really pissed. 

Today Nick's brother told Nick Nick shouldn't ignore his friend and hold a grudge. He said Nick is being childish and should talk to him because after all nothing bad happened.

What do you think? Is Nick the asshole?

Edit: In the past they did this same thing but using his phone instead. In those occasions he asked for Nick's code and Nick gave it to him, then changed it as Nick got back home. Nick knows he's free to not agree to do the same, but Nick feels he should have told Nick in advance if he wanted to change the rules of the game.

Well Judy and Judy's SO were getting ready to see a movie out, Judy's SO asked if Judy had what Judy needed, was Judy comfortable etc. Judy told Judy's SO yeah, and that's when Judy's SO's sister asked if Judy's SO's sister could have a pad aka diaper because Judy's SO's sister has been drinking a lot of water and Judy told Judy's SO's sister no.

So after all this and figuring out dates and where they were going Nick's brother mentioned that his wife's mom would be with them, coming. And Nick was like nah, pump the breaks, mothers are not invited. And Nick's older brother was like, yeah she is, they can’t leave her alone. He said she speaks no English and lives at their house, and didn't want to leave her alone. He said, ""what if something happens?""

So then Nick was like he didn’t want to go on the trip with his brother's MIL. The whole point was to hang out with just siblings. And Nick's brother was like well trip is off then, and Nick was like okay. Nick's older brother said Nick was being selfish and it wouldn't be right to leave her alone for 4 days while they all went on vacation.

Nick's other brother and sister were on Nick's older brother's side, saying they understood, and Nick was by himself there thinking how strange it was that his sister-in-law's mom would come on the trip. Nick's wife agrees with him that it's strange. So now the trip is off, and Nick is stuck there wondering ""what the hell.""

Edit: For everyone saying that she has to be alone. Nick suggested that their parents come stay at the house while they were on vacation so she wouldn't be alone. They are retired and would be happy to come, especially more because they share a grandchild. There are other options. Also, what's wrong with being alone? She's not bedridden.

Edit 2: Everyones getting hung up that Nick said ""Siblings trip."" So Nick will clarify that the original trip was planned in a group chat with his siblings and their wives. The in-laws were included in the planning and it was assumed they would be coming as well by all parties. If Nick took out siblings only in the title, and just put 'siblings, wives, and kids only,' which is what the trip was, then it might make more sense. The MIL was the only late addition change. The point is that the people involved in the planning understood who was and wasn't coming. It was everyone in the group chat.",False,True
1,"AITA for going to a party behind his gfs back? | Basically Nick was invited to a party by another girl, and his girlfriend has cried over Nick saying Nick wants to go. Nick is not going for the girl that invited Nick, nor is Nick interested in her, but she’s really popular and all of his friends were going and they would have a good time.

But his gf was convinced that she’d try mess with Nick, as she’s made comments about Nick in the past, maybe years ago. His gf said that she has finals the day after and all she would do is worry and nothing Nick could say would change that.

So after a heap of her guilt tripping and Nick and friends trying to persuade her it will be fine, Nick just decided to lie and say that Nick wasn’t going at all, she said she was over it but Nick guesses Nick thought she was just fronting, so Nick kept the lie going.

Nick went to the party, nothing crazy happened between Nick and the girl, Nick had a fun night out, while texting her here and there checking up on his gfs studies, and went home. She then sat her finals and said she knows she did really well, which is great, so Nick then told her later on in the day that Nick went to the party, and lied just to make sure she would do her exams stress free. She completely broke down, Nick told her that nothing even happened and she walked off in tears.

Nick feels terrible, but Nick is not letting someone prevent Nick from having a good night over seriously irrational fears, was it wrong to lie to her? Nick just wanted her to study in peace and Nick to have fun. Who’s the asshole here?

TL:DR went to a girls party his girlfriend didn’t want Nick going to, lied about not going so she could be stress free and do her exams in peace.

Edit: ‘her’ added before ‘guilt tripping’. Added ‘and lied just to make sure she would do her exams stress free’",False,True
1,"AITA for leaving Judy's gf alone in Judy's apartment while Judy had a drink or two with friends? | &#x200B;  

A little background info, Judy is 37f and she is 27 and due to work obligations they basically see each other once a week, either she comes over to Judy's apartment and stays for 2-3 days or Judy does. During this particular week she was over at Judy's place and they had an awesome time together the first dau. The next day Judy was supposed to be at work from 9am to 4pm and Judy left her alone in Judy's apartment while Judy tended to work. During Judy's shift Judy learned that Judy had to stay until 4:30 because Judy's shift change was running late and Judy told her that Judy was coming home asap and she said it was okay and that she didn't mind hanging alone for a little while.  

&#x200B;  

So fast forward two hours later Judy completely lost track of time, didn't text her or call her that Judy was gonna be late and even though Judy's shift ended at 4:30 Judy went to have a drink or two with friends. She wrote Judy a message at 6pm asking Judy what's the hold up and Judy told her Judy was having drink with friends, she didn't reply. When Judy arrived home at around 7:30pm she wasn't there yet Judy felt like a terrible piece of shit when Judy peeked into the kitchen and saw that she'd made Judy's favorite dish and plus went out of her way to get Judy's favorite wine.  

&#x200B;  

She came back at round 10:30, still pretty mad and Judy asked her where she was she said she was out with a friend. Then she confronted Judy by saying that she understands if Judy's friends or colleagues dropped by at Judy's workplace and it was fine and that she wouldn't have been upset if Judy texted her and told her that Judy was running late, she wouldn't have minded even if Judy arrived home at 00:00 and that all she needed was the info so she wouldn't wait around like an idiot alone. Judy could see she was upset and if she did the same thing Judy would have been way more upset than she was at the moment and yet Judy made the situation worse. All Judy said to her was ""this is who Judy is, deal with it"", she then proceeded to pack up all her stuff, threw the dinner in the garbage and left. Judy begged her to stay but she didn't.  

&#x200B;  

So how big of an asshole is Judy?

EDIT: Unanimous, Judy deserves it Judy supposes. Judy tried to call her and text her and she isn't answering or replying. Judy will try to mend things between them even though Reddit is on point of Judy not deserving her.

EDIT 2: She broke up with Judy, she told Judy that Judy's behavior was the last straw even though Judy told her multiple times that nothing like that will ever happen again she wouldn't budge. Judy is aware that Judy has issues and Judy will try to work on them hopefully from now on.",False,True
0,"AITA for not giving a baseball to a little kid? | First off, sorry if the formatting here is a little wonky since Nick is on mobile.

So on July 25th Nick was at the Kansas City Royals game vs the Cleveland Indians, Nick was there to watch the game, but chose seats in foul territory strategically to catch a 3rd out ball from the Indians. Nick is 18, and collects sports memoribilia, and doesn't have a game used ball in his collection. Nick has ones that Nick has bought, but not any that Nick has caught. After the 12th inning, Indians center fielder, Oscar Mercado threw Nick a bullet right to his glove after Nick called out his name, and he saw Nick was in Indians gear.

This older guy a few rows in front of Nick tried convincing Nick the ball was meant for his granddaughter who wasn't watching the game, but playing on a tablet with headphones on. He called Nick an asshole afterwards. So is Nick the asshole?

1,"AITA for breaking his dormmates' expensive camera? | So Nick, 20(M), had a pretty crazy time as a freshman at college last year. He won't go into any details but he was a pretty awkward and sheltered kid and he kinda reached his limits with alcohol and drugs etc. upset a few people and did some things he regrets.  So his dormmate has a polaroid camera that he loves and he took lots of pictures when they partied last year. A couple of these feature Nick doing some shit he wouldn't wanna show his mom or really remember in any capacity, he wants these gone and he asked him as much. He refused and just pouted stuff like 'You live and you learn bro', 'I wanna remember this party for me', 'just don't think about it bro'.

Anyway, a couple weeks ago Nick snook in when he was in the kitchen (doors unlocked) and took the photos. He must of seen or something cus the next morning they weren't on his desk.  So, to get to it, he went back and took them but he accidentally spilt his water in the dark and might of damaged his camera.

He was PISSED the next day and threatened Nick and told him to give him $300 for it even though he doesn't have any proof it was him. Now, firstly he's calling bullshit cus thats way too expensive and secondly he should of trashed the pictures in the first place.

He's moving home next week and he's planning on avoiding him and not paying up... AITA?

EDIT: He is from a rich family btw and wouldn't miss the money, whereas Nick got here on scholarships and working since 16.",False,True
1,"AITA for dividing Nick's income between ""money for Nick"", and ""money for the family""? | Nick works full time, and has a pregnant partner, the baby is due very soon. Nick's partner has recently stopped working completely, with Nick's unconditional approval and support. She has recently made some comments that makes Nick think that she's unhappy with their financial situation, but doesn't want to have an argument about it. She's a very non-confrontational person.

Nick has decided to split his income into 2 accounts. Nick has one for his own personal use, which is used for his own entertainment and frivolous things such as beer, video games, saving up for larger items that Nick wants for himself. Nick gives himself the equivalent of $65US per week, which is between 5% and 10% of his weekly income, depending on his hours.

Every other cent Nick earns goes into the second account, which they both have access to. Nick has made it clear that this account is for anything whatsoever she sees fit. Bills, savings, baby needs, or anything that she wants for herself. It's entirely up to her discretion.

The comments that she's made, while not outright calling Nick an asshole about it, are very passive aggressive and show an obvious resentment about the situation. Nick thinks he is being perfectly reasonable about it. AITA?

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses, they've been enlightening. Nick obviously has a blind spot in his thinking, and was not putting full consideration into how his partner feels. There are 2 main things that Nick takes away. 1, if Nick gets to block off ""play money"" for himself, then it's only fair to do the exact same for her. 2, putting sole responsibility on her for the finances is unreasonable. Nick has essentially said, ""ok this is for Nick, you sort the rest out yourself"". Nick needs to take a more active role in budgeting and not rely on her to do all of it.

Also, to those that are saying, ""You have a baby on the way, you need to make that your only priority. Having beer money is selfish"". Nick says that he thinks that making 100% of your life completely about the baby is a recipe for mental health problems. Nick feels it's important to TRY to continue doing things you enjoy, as a sole person and as a couple. Even if it's in a significantly diminished capacity.

0,"AITA for telling Nick's friend's gf not to come over if she hates Nick's décor so much? | Customary: ""long term lurker, new account"" and ""Nick is on mobile"" disclaimers.

Nick wants to start off by saying Nick personally thinks this situation is fuckin ridiculous and Nick is *pretty* sure Nick is not in the wrong here, but since it's causing so much fuss Nick wants the opinion of strangers.

So it goes like this: Nick is a guy who likes weird, old shit. Nick has a pretty extensive collection of antiques and oddities. Nick is aware that some of it is kinda creepy stuff to some people; namely, Nick has a taxidermy fox and quite a number of framed moths and butterflies, a couple of snake bones, as well as one of those teaching skeletons who just hangs out on Nick's sofa (his name is Reginald). It's not everybody's cup of tea and Nick gets that, Nick doesn't expect everyone to like it.

However. Recently, Nick's friend has started dating this new girl. Let's call her June. June *loathes* Nick's taste in decor. It's not just the taxidermy and bones and shit she hates. She complains that she's frightened of getting sick from Nick's antiques, that she always feels ""itchy"" at Nick's place and is convinced that there are dust mites in Nick's furniture (Nick takes great care to make sure Nick doesn't). She's constantly suggesting Nick throw pieces Nick adores away and buy brand new stuff, and Nick just doesn't want to do that. Now, this wouldn't be much of a problem if Nick's house wasn't the go to hangout for all of Nick's friends (friend group ranges from 18-22, everyone else lives at home and/or has flatmates they don't wanna disturb, Nick just lives with Nick's fiancé), and if she didn't make these complaints *every fucking time* she comes over.

Last weekend, they had a night out which started with pre drinks at Nick's. For all of the ~2hours people were over, Nick's not exaggerating when Nick says there was maybe 45 minutes total that June wasn't complaining. The next day Nick sent her a message basically saying ""look if Nick's décor bothers you so much it's maybe for the best you don't come over any more."" Apparently she became very upset by this, and went to Nick's friend saying that Nick was trying to force her out of social situations because she doesn't like the same things Nick does, and claiming Nick was ""bullying"" her because of her anxiety (Nick didn't know she had anxiety and Nick suffers with it Nickself, so of course that's not the case). Nick's friend is naturally defending June because of course he's gonna side with his girlfriend if she's claiming she's being bullied, but it's kind of dividing the group. Some are saying it's not Nick's problem if she's freaked out by Nick's stuff, others are saying Nick was a dick for confronting her like that. Nick can kinda see both sides, but Nick doesn't know what Nick's expected to *do* about her hating Nick's stuff so much. What do you guys reckon? Is Nick a dick? Is she a dick? Are they all dicks?

Edit: realised by dust mites Nick actually means fleas, maybe termites in wooden things. Nick's bad, Nick is a moron. To be clear tho, Nick *does* make sure to properly clean any furniture Nick brings into Nick's home thoroughly to rid it of potential pests, regardless of what the pests may be.",False,True
0,"WIBTA If Judy asked her friend’s husband to not bring booze? | About once a week, Judy and her husband host a game night for their friends. Judy is a 26F recovering alcoholic, as in bottle of gin a day alcoholic, her grandparents killed themselves from alcoholism, so did her aunts, her parents were abusive alcoholics, PEDIGREED alcoholic. 

She’s been about 6 months sober and damn proud of herself. She told all of her friends what was going on, in case she ever tried to drink around them so they would hold her accountable. Her husband doesn’t drink around her, he’s never been a big drinker anyways. Majority of her friends don’t drink alcohol, simply because most of them are picky eaters/drinkers and don’t like the taste. 

Her friend Erin and Erin’s husband Adam are big wine drinkers. Erin, however, doesn’t bring alcohol around her house, and is very considerate. 

However, the past 4 game nights, Adam has brought over about $200 worth of cocktail supplies. Like, fancy liquor, spirits, hard to find ingredients, a cocktail book, everything. He then proceeds to spend about an hour in her kitchen making cocktails. Most people don’t drink them, including Erin. She thinks one person had half of a cocktail when he was here. 

He didn’t do this before Judy announcing she was in recovery. He is also not drinking large amounts, he himself will only drink one or two cocktails. 

This last time, Adam left 4 mini bottles in her fridge. They were all alcohols that she drank before. She promptly threw them in the trash, but she felt very unsettled. 

She understands he is a grown man of 37, and she doesn’t have the right to ask anyone to change their behavior for her, but she is a bit hurt. WIBTA if she asked Adam to not bring alcohol in her home??

Edit: ok Judy had a conversation with Erin, Erin clarified that actually Adam did not originally want to bring drinks, but she said it would be ok. Essentially they knew Judy was an alcoholic but thought she had “recovered” enough because she tells jokes about it. For example, Judy started drinking a ton of sparkling water and LaCroix after she stopped drinking and she says “LaCroix cured her alcoholism!” Even though she had told them how much she was drinking and how bad it was, she guesses they didn’t take it as seriously because of her humor. 
Erin apologizes, said she would pass it on to Adam. Judy is still a little bit hurt because she thought this was kind of a no brainer, and she wishes they had taken her feelings into consideration. Her husband was very upset when it happened too. She will just do her best to move on from this and pray it doesn’t happen again.

Edit 2: holy shit thank you everyone for your support and THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD! 
Judy’s glad that this was sorted, and thank you to everyone who took the time to give their input. She realizes that part of this little issue was on her end, she tends to deal with all of her issues through humor, including some pretty severe trauma. She realizes she needs to communicate towards those who love her a lot better, they deserve her honest feelings, even if it’s uncomfortable to talk through it instead of crack jokes. She is worth more and her loved ones are worth more. Thank you everyone ❤️",False,True
1,"AITA for unknowingly letting slip someone’s boyfriend was kind of flirting with Judy? Ok, Judy goes to a business at least once a month to get supplies. A young guy there was somewhat flirty but Judy blew it off because Judy is old. Until the last time Judy saw him he said something so sweet to Judy, it changed Judy’s whole attitude about herself. Really. Judy must mention that this is a young man under 30. Judy herself has children older than him.

So, Judy wanted to know his name and called to ask. The manager told Judy. A few days later Judy went back in and asked if Judy could leave him a message. Judy was told yes. Judy scribbled a quick note saying thanks for the ego boost. The next time Judy went in Judy told the person there that he said the sweetest thing to Judy and one lady seemed interested in passing along Judy’s message. Judy just wanted him to know he did Judy a great favor in complementing an old woman. Made Judy feel young again.

Judy went back in after calling to see if they had Judy’s supplies in stock. Judy mentioned on the phone that the guy was sweet to Judy and the manager lady said that she would tell him when she saw him. Then, she mentioned that she would be there working that day. Judy thought that was odd to mention. So, Judy goes in and does Judy’s business, noticed one lady was watching Judy. No biggie. Judy goes. This week, Judy found out that while this young man was saying these things to Judy (in an oddly low tone btw) his girlfriend was in the next room. The staring person was his girlfriend.

Judy had no idea and Judy feels bad. How would you feel if you found out your bf was saying very sweet things to someone (old as they may be) while you were in the next room? Judy should’ve just kept that shit to herself. Nobody knows what he said to Judy except it was sweet. Judy feels weird going in there now. The young man doesn’t work there anymore but his gf does.

Nick is genuinely afraid for her because he doesn't want some unkind stranger ripping her hijab off of her or terrorising her. 
She says it's her belief and they shouldn't let fear get into the way of it and if anything were to happen, she wouldnt care because it would not be her fault. Nick disagrees because she's choosing to put herself in this unsafe situation and he has told her not to come crying to him later on then if she's ostracized once she begins college. 
This whole situation is so frustrating and Nick has told her if she continues on with this, then she can just forget about speaking to him. AITA for doing this? Nick is very worried and hates to see her going through difficult stuff when it can be easily stopped

A few days ago, Nick ordered a book on Amazon. When Nick got home, he saw a book-shaped amazon parcel waiting, and, being excited to receive it, he instantly went to open it. It turns out that actually it was a different book that Nick's housemate had ordered, and the package had the housemate's name on it. Nick immediately messaged the housemate apologising that he accidentally opened their package, and thought that would be the end of the matter.

The housemate soon messaged Nick back with a passive-aggressive reply. They had a brief back and forth over message, where the housemate essentially implied that they thought Nick was thoughtless and selfish, and that Nick was patronising them for not wanting to make a big deal over this.

They discussed the situation later in the evening, and the housemate remained stubborn that Nick was acting thoughtlessly and selfishly, and this was no trivial matter (which Nick thought it was). The housemate made the point that the parcel could have contained something deeply personal (and implied that they had ordered something of a sensitive nature), and that Nick would have immediately ruined their friendship, had he opened such sensitive parcel. The housemate was really firm and uncompromising in the discussion over this, accusing Nick of having a history of being self-centered, and it's shaken Nick's confidence in their friendship (they've been friends for many years).

It's also worth mentioning that this has happened once before a few months ago, but the housemate wasn't nearly as annoyed then.

Anyway, Nick appreciates this is a pretty petty scenario. Nevertheless, he'd appreciate hearing if ITAH here!

EDIT: thanks all for your feedback! Nick appreciates this isn't the most exciting AITA scenario, but it means a lot to hear your perspectives.
Nick thinks a fair summary would be that ITAH, specifically because this is the second time that it's happened, and that by saying it's not a big deal, Nick is sending the message that he doesn't care about his friend's possessions.

Judy never really cared for it, but Judy recognizes how much he loves music so Judy doesn't try to mess with it. He often spends hours practicing his instruments which Judy is fine with.

However, he's been pushy since their daughter has been born. Instantly when she was born he made her listen to music. Maybe made is too harsh. He just played music for her, either on his phone or with his instruments. He said it's to give her ""perfect pitch"", apparently it's when you are trying to give the kid the ability to tell pitches just by hearing them. It's accomplished by letting them listen to music (husband says it's certain types of music, like Jazz or Bach) and they'll gain that ability. Judy is fine with that and it's actually working which is cool.

Their daughter is now just 4 and he wants to give her an instrument to play. He gave an introduction to lots of instruments and told her to pick a one she wants to learn.

Judy says that it's strange to be forcing instruments down her throat at such an early age and that they should wait until later for her to choose by herself what she wants to do--whether that be sports, video games, or music.

AITA for not wanting to replace his chocolate because he left his door open? Yes the dog is solely Judy's but still...

Thanks all, a few extra notes  
1. Beau is well trained, doesn’t jump on the couch, doesn’t go into the kitchen. is relatively obedient, has boundaries. Doesn’t take food off the table however this bag of open chocolate was on the floor beside Judy's housemate's bed!! Beau and Judy have lived in the house for 7 years prior to this housemate coming in. He is not trained NOT to go into the housemate's bedroom because the housemate in fact lets him in all the time when he’s there.  
2. Judy doesn’t blame her housemate, it wasn’t done maliciously and Judy NEVER asked for help with the vet bill, it was only after he kicked up a stink about his 1kg bag of m&m’s that Judy said if Judy has to replace the chocolate he has to help with the vet bills. Judy doesn’t need him to help with the vet bill and never did. Judy just personally doesn’t think Judy should replace the chocolate when it’s not that hard for him to close his door and it was due to HIS Negligence that he’s now missing his chocolate.  
3. It’s not a requirement for him to have his door closed at all times, he’s not a prisoner...he needs to close the door when he leaves the house!!

1,"AITA For having his girlfriend skip out on her favorite restaurant on her birthday? | Bit of context, couple of days ago was his girlfriend's birthday, so naturally she wanted to go out to her favorite restaurant for dinner, which is Olive Garden. Nick has stated multiple times to her whenever they go there that he absolutely despises that place, but Nick continues to go whenever she wants to. This instance Nick made it apparent just how much he disliked Olive Garden, and suggested that they find a compromise restaurant or try a different Italian place. She refuses to go anywhere else or try anything Nick suggests. Nick was upset, and was in a bad mood for a while, so she suggested that she could just order something off their to-go menu and eat it at home while Nick gets some other food somewhere else. She seemed upset that she couldn't eat inside Olive Garden, and Nick felt kinda shitty that it happened on her birthday. AITA?

EDIT: He was the asshole, sees why, will try endless pasta. thanks doods",False,True
0,"Wibta if Nick doesn’t go to a family dinner because everyone forgot his 18th birthday? | So, Nick turned 18 just under 2 weeks ago and none of his extended family remembered.

Normally Nick would get a card from his nana&papa and his aunt almost a full week before his actual birthday, but this year Nick has yet to receive anything (not even a text to him or his parents. Nothing.)

A few days before his birthday one of his aunts sent out a group text to their whole family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.) telling everyone the annual spring birthdays dinner would be held on April 14, she then listed all the birthdays they would be celebrating and Nick's wasn’t included.

WIBTA if Nick doesn’t go? (His parents and his brother are also onboard with Nick not wanting to go and will also not be attending.)

Edit: this is Nick's moms side of the family and they see them every year for thanksgiving and Christmas so it’s not like Nick never sees them.

Nick doesn’t want to go because he thinks it’d be really uncomfortable for everyone, Nick either sits there and acts like his birthday didn’t also just happen or he brings it up and makes everyone feel awkward. Neither of these sounds like a pleasant time to Nick.

Edit: Okay Nick has his answers, were done here.",False,True
0,"AITA for leaving a family dinner cause Nick's family said that he was dumb? | Hi, so today, Nick (16M) and his family were talking about something that can't be mentioned in this subreddit. Nick said that he wanted to say what he thought about that subject, and his sister started giggling about how he was going to say something stupid probably taken from a youtube video. His dad laughed with her and insinuated that he was going to say something dumb, and his mom said how she was going to see if he was her son, insinuating that she is smart. Nick really got offended since his whole family was saying that he was dumb, and he really doesn't think so. He has really bad grades since he started studying in Switzerland (in German), and that's his 4th language, so he gets 3 and 4 out of 6 regularly. After that, he took his dishes, cleaned them and came to his room (he had already finished his dinner). Everyone says that he should come back and that was being rude. He is now in his room and he wonders, AITA here? P.S.: sorry for grammar errors, he's not a native speaker.

Edit: 30 min later, his mom knocked and apologised, his sister was embarrassed and his dad didn't say anything. Thank you all for the advice!",False,True
0,"WIBTA Judy Wants to wear a dress | Judy is getting ready to be hostess to a holiday party. It was one Judy's DH asked if Judy would do. He wants to show off a bit. He hasn't done anything to help with the party as of yet. (It is Saturday). Judy has set it for inside the house and in the back yard. Judy rented the extra heaters, made the back yard interesting, and a place he can show off his projects, Judy has been baking for days, appetizers, food etc...
They spent 2 years redoing the house, it was a fixer upper. Judy has cleaned, cooked and is still prepping everything. Judy also works full time like him. 
This is a casual party. Most everyone will be in comfortable clothes.   Judy wants to dress up, hair makeup, dress the works (nothing formal, just a dress and heels). He says Judy is going to upset him and his friends if Judy does. AITA for Judy wanting to dress nicely. Judy can't dress at work, as what Judy does is a dirty job. This has become a big argument with them. Judy is now starting to feel guilty, and resentful Judy gives a lot, but Judy did this to help him, as Judy has some time off this week. The party is a big deal to him.

Judy just remembered: When they told them about the party, and they asked Judy what they should wear, Judy just said clothes that make you happy. Judy thinks Judy mentioned Judy had a dress Judy wanted to wear. Judy's husband just confirmed Judy mentioned Judy planned on a dress.

Update: The party came off without a hitch. Yes, Judy wore Judy's green dress, Judy also did Judy's hair and makeup. Judy thinks Judy's husband worried for nothing. Although most of the guests arrived in jeans, some of the women sparkled. Thank you all for the backbone Judy needed.",False,True
0,"AITA for not catering to his employee's needs? | Not sure where to start on this one, but here we go.

Nick runs a small software company and recently moved to a different country alone. One of his earlier employees needed to make extra cash and kept messaging Nick that he wanted to come and stay in his new city for a month and work together.

Nick was convinced (he's usually a good worker), so Nick booked him a flight to his city and arranged a month worth of Airbnb. Nick cleared out his schedule (canceled date with his girlfriend, among other things) so that Nick could get him settled that weekend.

The problem was, 2 days before the flight he told Nick he needed to see his family in another city where the connecting flight was. He meant to do this from the beginning and just forgot to tell Nick. So he said he would be there a day late. Nick was a little annoyed but Nick was ok with this and they made a plan to pick him up on Sunday. Then right before the flight he told Nick he decided to stay another day so they should meet up on Monday.

At this point Nick was pretty mad because

* Nick canceled all his weekend plans to accommodate him, and he kept changing things last minute.
* He didn't bother telling Nick about his intentions beforehand
* They could've avoided paying 2 extra days of Airbnb for no reason
* He partially wanted to use this opportunity as a chance to see his family and friends, and the attitude kind of showed

Nick told him he was quite upset with how this situation was handled and he didn't seem bothered and made it seem like Nick was overreacting. AITA?

Update: Nick gave him a call and went respectfully ballistic on his ass and now he was hella sorry lol. Nick thanked the commenters for making it clear that he was NTA. That gave Nick the conviction to say his feelings.",False,True
1,"AITA for arguing with Judy's bf's housemate about Judy's ESA? | So Judy just started dating this guy, they really click, he's great, yadda yadda. He lives in a house with 3 other people, owned by one girl. It's a super nice house, and they're all good friends. At first Judy was a bit apprehensive because two of the housemates are girls, but she met them early and they seemed cool.

Until this past weekend, that is. The house threw a party, which Judy heard are always amazing. She was invited, and she wanted to bring her emotional support dog, Sadie, to the party with her. Judy has really bad anxiety sometimes and she helps a lot. Sadie is super well behaved and a medium sized dog, so Judy thought it would be no problem, plus people really love her especially at parties. She's a total ham. Judy even put her ESA harness on her. But when they got to the door, Judy's boyfriend and housemate (the house owner) opened up and she looked a little pissed. She said Sadie can't come into the party, that it's not a good environment for a dog, and she wasn't given advance notice so that she could at least dogproof. But why would Judy give notice that she is bringing her support animal with her?

So Judy asked her what if Judy was blind or epileptic and needed a dog. She said if Judy was blind she would have been happy to make arrangements beforehand for her, and that if Judy was epileptic that party wouldn't be a good environment for her anyway, as there are strobes and loud music which also aren't great for dogs, totally missing the point. Judy kept arguing with her about the legally protected status of her dog, and she just kept saying it doesn't apply for private property. This kept going on for like 15 minutes and she got more and more annoyed, saying she's seen Judy a hundred times out without the dog, but it's a party which is duh, where Judy's more likely to have anxiety so of course Judy wanted her there.

After going back and forth she was basically like, ""look, the dog isn't coming into my house. That's final. You can put her in the backyard but that's it.""

While in the backyard, Sadie dug up some stuff because she's used to always being with Judy and Judy guesses broke or chewed a chair. Judy's fine with paying for those things if her and her bf stay together, but she kinda doesn't want to because if she'd just let her dog stay with her it wouldn't have even happened and because her bf didn't really take her side against his housemate and said it would be best if Judy doesn't bring Sadie over there again in the future as his housemate is really pissed.

AITA for getting into it with her?

EDIT: For the people focused on her not wanting to pay, she said she didn't want to, not that she won't, but as she said in the comments: The chewing in the backyard, she didn't even see, so she's not even sure if it happened or if it was her and asked for pictures but still haven't seen any, and the flowers her bf sent her a picture, doesn't look like she dug them up, but instead was walking on them since they were right next to the backdoor and she wanted to get to her. She still gets that she should have to pay if she messed up the flowers, that's not the point.

ALSO: Her argument wasn't that she's legally allowed to be in the house, just that it's dickish to refuse because it's a support animal. It was more than her dog is an esa so does have some legal rights and isn't ""just a pet"". Even a service animal can't go into a private house, duh, everyone knows that. That's why she said she totally missed her point. But whoever that person is that says a service animal CAN'T is an asshole which is why she thinks she is the asshole.",False,True
1,"AITA for asking people to not post negative things about America on July 4th on Nick's page? | So Nick posted a story on Instagram about him asking people to say negative things about America on 4th of July and one person responded with “why don’t you just let people have their own opinions” in his opinion, he just wanted people to stop shitting on this holiday for today. 

So is Nick the asshole?

1,"WIBTA if Nick outs his son but not really? | so Nick is on mobile hence the weird formatting. if it’s weird. idk. 

anyway! Nick (m34) has a beautiful 13 year old son. his mother isn’t in the picture for reasons not important to the story (and Nick doesn’t feel comfortable sharing anyway.) for purposes of this, let’s call him layne. layne’s Nick's eldest, and Nick and his son are pretty tight. a few days ago, he had a friend over called “mike”. Nick was bringing them the pizza they ordered, when Nick heard layne tell mike that “my dad doesn’t know we’re dating, he might not be cool.”
pause. 
okay. clearly he didn’t want Nick to know that.
so Nick set the pizza downstairs, and tells his daughter (alice) to call them. 

now, Nick is bi, Nick thinks, himself, but Nick never brought it up. and his son is definitely not straight. mike’s birthday is soon, and Nick was thinking, Nick could make like rainbow cupcakes on it, and tell layne “it’s for him and mike”

wibta if Nick did this??? Nick just wants to show his son Nick loves him, no matter his orientation.

edit: idk if it’ll change the ruling, but Nick wasn’t planning on telling him “oh Nick knows you’re gay”, so much as just make rainbow cupcakes. like Nick wouldn’t be saying, “Nick knows you and mike are a thing.” it would be mike-as-a-friend.

edit two: Nick hears you guys. normal cupcakes it is. thank you all for your help and advice!! it means so much to Nick. Nick will let his son come out to Nick, and when he does, Nick will let him know, Nick will always love him.",False,True
0,"AITA for telling his dad he's invited to the wedding, but his mom is not? | Background: Nick hasn't talked to his mom in 2+ years and has talked to his dad occasionally on the phone. Nick lives 600 miles away from his parents. Nick hasn't talked to his mom because his mom hates his fiancée. Nick and his fiancée have been together for 5+ years, his mom has hated her from day one. Nick's mom won't give a reason for hating her. During a very rough time in his fiancée's life (her great-grandparents who she lived with as a child passed away in a 6 week span, she had emergency surgery where she nearly lost an ovary, and had been diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome: all of this happened over the course of 3 months), his fiancée was still trying to be on good terms with them (she would go to everything she was invited to, bring host gifts, baked goods, etc) Nick's mom sat Nick and his fiancée down and demanded they break up. Nick's mom said that anything bad in their family was caused by Nick's fiancée, that she shouldn't have children and ruin Nick's mom's bloodline, that she was isolating Nick (Nick's fiancée was visiting while on college break and went to college 300 miles away from where Nick's parents lived and where Nick lived until they moved to their current location), accused her of lying about her baby cousin (4 years old) having leukemia (true), and other really not okay things. Nick's fiancée just took it and when Nick's mom was done ranting she left and said that Nick's mom owed her an apology, Nick agreed. It's 4 years after that moment and there's still been no apology. Nick has been No Contact with his mom for 2 years because his mom kept telling him she would apologize and then wouldn't. Since then Nick's mom has talked shit about Nick's fiancée to anyone who listens and cries to people about how Nick's fiancée is keeping Nick away from her.

Nick and his fiancée are planning their wedding. They set a date, Nick couldn't be happier. They announced to their closest friends and family that they had set a date. Nick texted his dad to let him know (as Nick didn't want him to hear it from someone else) and asked that they talk about it. His dad responded by asking the date and wanting to know what Nick wanted to talk about. Nick told him that given how things were with his mom, it wouldn't be appropriate for her to attend (and also letting him know that as with before, if she can apologize and own her behavior that they can re-evaluate it. Nick also let him know Nick would really like for him to attend, but that Nick would understand if he chose not to because Nick's mom isn't invited (they are still married, he still enables her behavior but is overall a good guy) but if he could let Nick know what he'd like to do, it would be appreciated as they're working on their Save the Dates/Guest List and their venue (a small historic inn) has a capacity of 65 people. That was a few weeks ago, he hasn't said anything since. Nick has tried reaching out to talk to him on phone, text, and email but still no response. AITA for telling him he's invited but Nick's mom isn't?",False,True
0,"AITA for opening the bathroom door and exposing someone on the toilet? | Throwaway account because Nick's main one is too obvious.

Okay so today Nick was at work, just like any other normal day. Nick's office has a reception waiting area and a bathroom directly across it. The bathroom is usually used by the female employees but it isn’t labelled and Nick's company wouldn’t object to anyone else using it.

Nick headed up to use the bathroom and knocked before going in. The handle went down smoothly and Nick opened the door a crack, before pausing to chat with the receptionist. As their conversation continued, Nick leant into the door, gradually exposing more and more of the bathroom.

Eventually Nick turned to head in and got so legitimately frightened to see a well-dressed gentleman sitting on the toilet, just staring back at him. The gentleman's pants were around his ankles and a horrible odor quickly emerged from the bathroom. The other guests at reception could now see him. Nick apologised frantically and quickly shut the door. The man didn’t make a single noise and gave no indication of him being in the bathroom, from Nick knocking to him opening the door. Nick was informed later on the man reported the incident and now HR will be questioning Nick in the next few hours. Nick found out from the receptionist that the man is a high-end client of Nick's company and the incident made the man extremely furious. The man requested HR to fire Nick and stated Nick was irresponsible for opening the door like that without checking. The man’s extremely wealthy and well respected in the office, Nick's company would do anything to please him so now Nick is questioning if he really deserves to potentially get fired for embarrassing the man like that.

Reddit, AITA?

Edit - thank you to everyone who was super supportive! To answer the question - the door does indeed lock, in fact, it has a twisty lock on the handle and then a bolt slightly higher up! HR have agreed to not fire Nick but he has to write an apology letter to this client.",False,True
1,"AITA if Nick, a smoker, refused to move for an asthmatic colleague? | So this happened at lunch today and it's all quite awkward at work now.

Nick's colleagues and Nick decided to go to this chinese place for lunch. At the end of the meal, they were waiting for their company car to pick them up (there were 5 of them), and in the mean time, Nick thought he'd nip out and have a smoke.

Nick came back and sat down next to the asthmatic colleague, and she immediately said ""SmokeThatUp, you need to sit somewhere else while we're waiting. You stink of smoke and I can't breathe because of my asthma"".

This was already more confrontation than Nick needed all year, so he kind of awkwardly laughed it off and sat further away from her. They were sitting three on one side and two on the other, and Nick basically sat in an empty space as far away from her as possible. [Crude illustration](https://imgur.com/a/X2WVizf); Nick went from red to blue, if she's black.

But that wasn't enough, and she watched Nick sit down and then said ""No, I mean somewhere else. Not on this table. Please, I can't breathe"".

So Nick just smiled and politely told her if she couldn't breathe, she was welcome to move herself.

She told him it was very rude of Nick to ignore her health concerns for a stupid habit, and Nick just awkwardly shrugged his shoulders and kept quiet.

Nick felt totally justified in his actions, but his other colleague later told him that the smell of smoke can be a huge trigger for asthma, so now Nick felt shitty.

0,"AITA for secretly doing background checks on the men Judy dates? | After 2-3 dates, Judy does a background check on them without them knowing.

1,"AITA for wanting Nick's roommate to let Nick keep a pet Nick saved? | Recently Nick found a stray dog that was likely going to die without Nick's help. Nick saved the dog, took it to the vet, made sure it did not have any fleas/parasites, and got her all the shots she needed. Originally Nick planned to find the dog a loving home but after asking Nick's friends and parents, Nick has not been able to find anyone who will take her in.

Nick rents a house with three other roommates. When they signed onto the lease, there was a ""no pets"" clause in the contract but after speaking with the landlord, he has said that he is willing to amend the contract to allow for Nick's pet if all the other residents are okay with a dog being in the house. All of the roommates are okay with the dog staying except one. The second he saw Nick's dog he said, ""We cannot keep that here."" He said he was worried that even if the landlord allowed the dog, there is still a chance he could be on the hook for any damages it causes.

Eventually, he compromised said that they could keep the dog in the house while Nick took care of setting up the vet appointments and getting her all the shots she would need to be able to be given away. Now that Nick has been taking care of the dog for the past two months, and unable to find a home, Nick has become attached and desperately does not want to give the dog up to a shelter where Nick will have no control over what happens to her.

Since Nick has not found a new home for the dog, Nick's roommate offered to let Nick buy him out of his security deposit and also asked that Nick take on $50 of his rent because he never wanted a pet in the house. The problem is that Nick cannot afford to pay for these extra expenses but Nick loves this dog and feels like Nick is now responsible for it. Is Nick the asshole for asking Nick's roommate to make an exception and allow the landlord to modify the lease without paying more money?

Edit: Nick wants to be clear that Nick can afford the dog, Nick's parents have given Nick enough money that Nick won't have to worry about finances for a while after graduating. Paying for the needs of the dog is not a problem. Nick thinks Nick's roommate is asking for this $50 a month just because he never wanted to have a dog in the house from the beginning.

2 of Nick's 3 roommates are okay with her living in the house from now on and the landlord will amend the lease but this one roommate is being unfair with the upfront security deposit and the monthly fee.

Nick is not an irresponsible dog owner, Nick is not only going to keep the dog in Nick's room, Nick plans to let her out for walks/the bathroom (and when he isn't around so she can enjoy the house with the other roommates)",False,True
0,"AITA for refusing to change clothes at a wedding? | Some background here: Nick is Indian, so he wears saris basically everywhere because his parents are really strict about his heritage. Second, Nick has eczema, so his lower body is covered with scratches, dry skin and scales, and the sari helps cover it up.
This takes place 2 months ago, but Nick is still getting hate for it, and passive-aggressive jabs at the dinner table and group chats.

So, Nick is at his Indian-American cousin (male) to a beautiful American woman's (who we'll call Laura) wedding. Its in India so Nick packs mostly saris, lehengas and one maxi gown with stockings. (There are a lot of events: mehendi, haldi, thaledivasum, madhereveppu, wedding rehearsal, sangeet, after party, evening party, two receptions, the ceremony, etc)
So for the haldi, Nick is wearing a yellow net sari, which mostly everyone wears for haldi (because they smear turmeric on the bride and the women)
To his shock, the guests were mostly American women wearing short dresses. Laura pulls Nick aside and asks him to change because she felt Nick's dress was too gaudy, and hands him a short dress with a diamond pattern. See, Nick wouldn't have been averse to changing if she had given him a longer dress, but she gave a mini dress which showed off his legs, which were covered in scars, scales, scratches, etc. So, Nick refused, but he told her that if she could find him a longer dress he would change. She told him he was a bitch for dressing up like that for a haldi, as it obviously was too extravagant for small events.
Nick left, and that night he was called by a lot of Laura's family members and friends (don't know how they got Nick's number) and told him he was an asshole and things like that because he wouldn't change after the bride had very politely given him a dress and asked him to change, and accused him of trying to upstage her.
So, AITA?

OKAY: For all the people asking about the sari Nick wore, check out his profile. Just imagine it a bit more sparkly.

UPDATE: Laura and her husband, who we'll call Sunil, is atm quarantining with Nick's family as they could not leave. She's still making these jabs at him, including talking about his legs. (Nick wears shorts at home because he's comfortable with his parents.)
Also, for the people asking, everyone in Nick's family thinks he's NTA, and that Laura should apologise. His parents were horrified at her for asking him to change. So... Nick has apologised to her because he doesn't want anyone to think that he's being stubborn, but she's still carrying on with the hate in full force. That's why Nick made this AITA post, because he could not genuinely see why she was angry at him. Nick also feels like there's an underlying problem to this.
UPDATE 2: Nick confronted her this morning. Basically told her she could shut up or leave. Told Sunil that with her extremely rude jabs at him, they couldn't stay there if she continued. Asked Laura why the hell she gave Nick's number to strangers. She told him that she forgot to tell him that the haldi had a dresscode for the women, which were dresses, and for the aunties: saris, and that she was nice enough to offer him a dress so he could blend in with the crowd, and he didn't have to cause a scene. Also that even if people saw his legs, it's alright, because it's not his wedding, and the attention must be on Laura.
Needless to say, Nick kicked her out to stay with Sunil's parents.
UPDATE 3: She made an AITA post. Also apologized to Nick. All is well.

1,"AITA for Nick saying classmate's bf acts like a teenage girl | There's a gay guy from Nick's year (we're 19-20 and in uni, just for reference) whose boyfriend acts and pretty much looks like a basic teenage girl. Nick's friends have even said they recognize some of his shirts, hoodies and accessories from the girls' section in New Yorker (it's a brand here in Europe that's like Forever 21 in America, Nick thinks) and the way he talks + his social media photos, filters and interests are more-less indistinguishable from Nick's 13yo sister and her friends.

So it's become sort of an inside joke among Nick's classmates, *not* in front of his bf obviously, that this guy is just an overgrown tween girl stereotype and that our classmate (his bf) will drop him as soon as he realizes he can do better, since this is his first relationship.

Anyway, when Nick showed Nick's roommate some of our group messages where people were joking about this, she said quote-unquote you guys gossip like high schoolers but he's the teenage girl? Which Nick thinks she completely missed the point, we're talking as friends about another friend who we know can do much better. When Nick explained the whole situation, she still insisted that we're being mean and ""kind of homophobic"" which Nick wholeheartedly disagrees with, Nick would make fun of any person of any gender who's in their 20s but acting like they're 13.

Nick guesses Nick is asking for an objective opinion though, have we really crossed the line into assholery considering we never actually harassed anyone or even said this stuff to our classmate and his boyfriend?",False,True
0,"WIBTA if Judy left the last steak for her SO to cook for his damn self? | By the time Judy gets any replies, this will probably be a moot point, but Judy is still curious. Judy: works 8-5 Tues-fri, has kid from prior relationship, takes care of most day to day bullshit. Him: works 12s on rotating shift, so 2 on, 2 off, 2 on, 3 off, etc. Rarely does anything other than work or video games, especially without prompting.

Judy and her SO make about the same money, contribute the same to the static bills (rent, wsg, electric, etc).

Judy has been trying to implement a system where basically whoever is home first deals with dinner. If he and Judy both work on a given day, Judy is home first, Judy deals with dinner. So on and so forth. This was lightly discussed...Judy told him what Judy had been aiming for, he said that that sounded fair.

Today: he did not work, Judy did. He bought dinner, which in itself is kind of a 50/50 chance. Judy expressed appreciation. Judy gets home, neither one of them is hungry yet, whatever. An hour goes by...kid is getting hungry, has a history of migraines exacerbated by dehydration and hunger. Judy mentions this. He wants Judy to finish watching a half hour video with him, after Judy tells him that this is happening. Judy says no, kid migraine is slightly more important, Judy will cook dinner herself. He shrugs and puts his headphones back on.

Judy has been writing this in chunks, so at this point all steaks are cooked...but Judy was so very, very fucking tempted to cook Judy's and child's and leave his raw in the fridge. Would Judy have been an asshole to do that?

Edit/update/info: so Judy doesn't hafta repeat herself lol...

1) Judy's son is not being starved. There is food in the house, and there was an adult to ask about snacks/dinner/whatever - it just wasn't Judy, up until about an hour before this happened. Judy isn't sure if he didn't ask, or literally just didn't realize he was hungry until right around their normal dinner time. Hunger does not always lead to migraine, either, but over the years Judy has learned to tell the difference when he asks. SO has not had nearly as much practice at it, so Judy doesn't expect him to interpret kiddo's tone/expression the same way Judy does...but when Judy talked to him about getting dinner started, Judy did specifically tell him that kiddo, this time, seemed to be gearing up for one if they didn't get him fed soon.

2) Judy has consulted a doc about the migraines. They've been managing them fairly well usually, but his medication only works if they catch one in time, and Judy prefers to solve the issue with nutritional intake if it's still possible to do so. His migraines, when they get to full-blown, cause him to throw up everything, until he can keep down his meds long enough for them to work, and he usually needs to sleep for a bit after as well...so if one gets bad right before dinner, the poor guy isn't likely to be able to keep anything down until morning, which can cause a cycle. If anyone has migraines themselves and has helpful suggestions, Judy welcomes them! Thanks in advance :-)

3) They all have ADHD/ADD, only kiddo and Judy are medicated though. It leads to some hectic situations, and they all need to improve how they communicate/plan/deal with things.

4) Judy did bring it up with SO after dinner. In Judy's usual fashion, Judy made a mess of it, and they did end up going to bed angry. But this morning after things had processed, they discussed what went badly and what they can both improve on...this isn't a relationship-ender lol. Judy posted mostly because Judy isn't always self-aware enough to know whether or not (or how badly) Judy is over-reacting to something.

Judy suffers from chronic pain and takes a variety of meds which cause a decrease in appetite and nausea. Judy hasn’t disclosed her illness to her in-laws, but a few nights ago Judy could hear her future mother-in-law complaining about how Judy’s too good to eat what they cook. Judy let it go.

Yesterday, Judy's fiancé took her around his hometown. On the way back, he remembered to get beer, but they were already pulling into the driveway. Judy was tired, so he dropped her off. His parents were waiting for Judy in the living room, angry.

FMIL took Judy's package and showed Judy where FFIL took a few bites and threw up soon after.

It had been 10 minutes and Judy's fiancé was back. His mom asked him if he knew all the medication Judy’s on and how Judy brought pot into their house. He couldn’t get a straight answer about how they knew about Judy's medicine, but then he glanced at the package and just sighed.

Fiancé: Mom, it’s soap. Even says African Black Soap.

He broke off a piece, headed to the kitchen, and washed his hands with it, showing them the lather. FMIL fired back saying that she’s never seen soap like that and that this doesn’t explain the amount of meds Judy takes. They said they’re justified in what they did because they want the best for their son and since it’s their house they can go through personal belongings at will.

Judy let them have it. Judy started screaming and cussing because Judy was exhausted and tired. Judy can’t remember everything Judy said, but Judy's throat had been a mess from all of the screaming. FFIL tried to give Judy back the soap, but Judy kind of threw it at him saying Judy didn’t want his gum disease. Terrible, Judy knows.

They were staying at a hotel and not talking to his parents. Judy felt she could have gone about it better. Judy wanted a good relationship with her in-laws and they’d always kind of gotten along... now Judy felt like she fucked up badly.

**TL;DR: future in-laws went through Judy's luggage and mistook soap for an edible. Judy cussed them out and offended them and now Judy feels like she burned a major bridge.**

Obviously, that’s not a picture of the actual soap. That’s just what the soap looks like. Judy doesn’t have it anymore.",False,True
0,"AITA for Judy getting mad at her husband for not getting it together for Judy's birthday dinner with Judy's family? | First time poster, long time lurker.

This happened yesterday afternoon. Judy's aunt and uncle had just moved back from across the country after being gone for 6 years. This was the first birthday Judy got to spend with them in a long time. Judy is very close with Judy's aunt, Judy's dad’s sister. Judy's uncle is very lovely and funny too, Judy was excited to see him. They are both elderly and their health is in really bad shape. Judy's parents are in their 70’s and Judy tries to spend time with them as much as Judy can. Long back story Judy's dad is in poor health and Judy's mom cares for him. Judy is so grateful to have all them together for Judy's birthday dinner. Cue Judy's husband. He’s been under the weather for about a week with a cough. He was still not feeling good as they got ready to meet everyone for dinner. Judy asked if Judy could get him anything, he said no. He was basically silent all the way to the restaurant, it was an hour drive. Judy tried the whole time to be friendly and try to engage him. He either gave Judy one word answers or said nothing. They make it to the restaurant and he is still basically silent. They help Judy's dad with his walker into the restaurant while Judy's mom parks. Judy sits at their table and Judy's husband sits a couple seats down from Judy. Judy is confused and a little hurt. He told Judy Judy should move so Judy's dad and aunt can easily sit. Judy moves. Judy's aunt is now in a wheelchair so Judy's mom and Judy help her into a chair. The entire dinner he maybe speaks 5 words. Judy's mom is sitting next to him and she keeps trying to engage him and he gives one word answers. Judy's dad tried and he did the same thing with him. Judy's uncle finally says hey Judy's husband are you okay? Judy's husband grumbled and said he was fine. His attitude was so hostile everyone could feel it. It put a huge damper on the whole dinner. It was so awful. Judy was so embarrassed. This was the first time they have gotten together in 6 years and Judy's husband acts like a sullen brat. Judy gets he didn’t feel good but get it together for an hour. He could have very easily told everyone he was under the weather but happy to be there. Nothing. When they left Judy snapped. Judy told him how selfish and childish it was to just blow off Judy's family when he could have very easily said he didn’t feel good but he was happy to be there. He doesn’t think he did anything wrong. Judy said if he felt that sick he shouldn’t have come. AITA for Judy being upset her husband couldn’t get it together for Judy's birthday dinner with Judy's family?

To everyone who keeps asking, yes Judy gave him multiple attempts to stay home. Judy asked him serval times before they left if he wanted to stay home. Judy asked him if they should stop on the way to get something for him. He declined every time. He had plenty of opportunities to speak up and tell everyone he wasn’t feeling good. It’s not Judy's responsibility to speak for him. He’s a big boy, he can speak for himself.",False,True
