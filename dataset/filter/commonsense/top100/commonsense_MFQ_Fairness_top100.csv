0,"AITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married? | A bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.

Now to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)

Her family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.

So now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.

I'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a ""real school"". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.

Now I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.

However I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.

Now apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.

AITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.",False,False,4,5,2,3,1,4,Fairness,653
0,"AITA for not wanting to look after my autistic younger cousin? |  

Some background, my cousin is 16 and I'm 20. I've always been fond of him, we used to be really close, people would joke about us being brother and sister.

So, last week my uncle called my mum to say that my aunt (who was a recovering alcoholic) had started drinking again and she's not getting out of bed, not showering, not helping to look after my cousin etc... and I just felt this immediate sense of dread because this same thing happened before. When I was 17 my nan got that same exact call, I offered to go with her to check up on my aunt and we ended up coming back with my cousin. I was pretty happy at first, I wasn't seeing much of him at the time so it was nice to be able to spend time with him.

After a while, I realised that my mum had agreed to let him stay at our place while my uncle was trying to get help for my aunt in the hopes that I would be the one looking after him. My mum was working full-time and my sister was away for the summer with a club, which left me as the obvious candidate as I was on my summer holidays. I didn't mind at first, it was nice having him around but looking after him meant that I had to be with him all the time. I had to take him to the park, I had to bring him with me to hospital and dentist appointments (I was late in my recovery from surgery so I had a lot of follow-up appointments). From when he woke up at about 5 in the morning until my mum got home from work at 7, I had to be watching him. I couldn't go out with friends, couldn't even have friends over otherwise he would kick up a fuss. The only alone time I had was at night which is when I like to go on my laptop, listen to music, do some writing but by that time I was too tired to do any of that. There were times when I'd catch him masturbating, not even accidentally walking in on him but he would do it in the open in the living room, would shove his hands down his pants when we were out in public. I would tell him not to do it, he would say sorry but carry on.

That was my whole summer. I was stressed, I was missing out on a lot and I was missing my friends, my mum kept telling me that it wasn't for long, that we (?) were doing it for my aunt. He was here for over 6 weeks. That's the experience that turned me off of wanting to look after him again.

My mum got in touch, told me it's happening again and if I can come home for a week or so to help look after him. I just straight up told her no. I'm older now, I'm living away from home, I'm a student working part-time with amazing friends. I told her that I have a life of my own now, I can't just drop everything and come home to look after my cousin. She got really upset with me and told me I'm being selfish because she has to work and look after my sister (who's now the same age I was when the responsibilty was dumped on me). I told her that it's not fair to just expect me to do it and then hung up on her. I've been trying to forget about it but a part of me feels bad.

0,"AITA for being pissed off at my mom's boyfriend and expecting him to ask to watch tv? | My mom has been with her boyfriend around 6-7 years, they fight most of the time and every so often they have massive blow-up fights that get ugly. They fight about the same things all the time and it's just a vicious, repetitive cycle. They become verbally abusive to each other and have gotten physical in the past. 

In the 3 months I've been living with them, maybe 4-5 times I've been watching tv when he's come home. He usually gets home around 4:30 but sometimes shows up whenever. One night around 7:30 my mom and I were sitting in the kitchen and I put a hockey game on, he came home, didn't say anything to either of us, walked to the couch, picked up the remote and changed the channel without even asking if we were watching anything. Another time I was off work for the day and it was 2 in the afternoon and he came home and went upstairs for the rest of the night apparently because I was watching tv, but if he said he wanted to watch I would have had let him have the tv. My sister made a huge deal that I was in his space and shouldn't be watching tv, and my mom said whenever he comes home I should just go to the basement. I said it's unfair that everyone should have to bend to his will just because he gets upset at the smallest things, and he could just say he wanted to watch tv and I'd have no problem. My mom agreed with me that he was being ridiculous and rude, and I said I would not let him get whatever he wants just because he's a baby about it. 

So fast forward a bit and the 2 of them were fighting again and he called my mother a whore among other things, I guess my tv watching was somehow a part of it as well. They got into a massive fight when I was out of the house for an entire day, my mom said she ripped his shirt and the dog gate to the kitchen was smashed and she told me I had gotten my wish because he might never be coming back. Shame on me for thinking my mom had finally come to her senses because it lasted about 2 1/2 weeks and then a couple days ago she told me he was coming back and all of a sudden was framing it like me watching tv was the only reason they had fought and I was the issue. I told my mom I'm just not going to up and leave whenever he gets home, and if he wants the tv and I'm watching something, then he can say so and I'll have no issue. Apparently this was way out of line on my end and now my mom is telling him she hates me, that I'm lazy and I deserve nothing. I'm really confused by this 180 because she had no problem agreeing with what I said 2 weeks prior, but now her and my sister are painting me as the villain.

This morning he tried to tell me that what him and my mom had was ""different"" and that he cares for her deeply, and I can use whatever I want, but to understand that it's his space. I told him ""I don't care for you because you called my mother a whore"" and left, he hasn't said anything to me since and my mom hasn't spoken to me since he came back and I'm left wondering how I'm the bad guy

0,"AITA for abandoning my friend and her kids? | I had a friend who was renting a house and was going to need a new roommate soon, as long as I was ok couch surfing for the first month since I just lost my apartment due to money issues after losing my full time job. It was $800 a month for a room in the basement and a private bathroom. That included utilities and internet. Only other stipulation is she would need help feeding her kids (13f & 15m) here and there.

While I worked 2 jobs I wasn’t exactly rolling in dough as both jobs weren’t great. As time goes on I go from feeding her kids sometimes to being the one to feed them and if I didn’t then they may not eat. It got worse to the point where I was working 2 physically demanding jobs on less than 1000 calories worth of food a day. I was literally starving and trying to push what I could to feed the kids. I worked my ass off trying to find a better job and was able to get something finally.

Suddenly the person paying the internet bill decided he wanted to move out with little warning and it fell to me to take care of it. When he came back he never took it back over. So now I am paying close to $900 a month plus a massive food bill. My sister has been asking me if I want to live with her because she knows I’ve been in a bad way and my depression is getting worse since I could no longer afford therapy. April rolls around and it’s time to renew the lease, the roommate who invited me is lamenting she wants to move out but is trying to find someone to take her spot. At this point she has been out of work due to TIA and FM and claims she can’t afford rent anymore. I say let’s sit down and look at the bills and see what’s can be done to balance things out for her and that’s when the other shoe drops.

The whole time she has been paying about $600 a month for three bedrooms (the house has 5 bedrooms), one for her with a private bathroom and 1 each for the kids. She made as much as I did before being on disability so why was I paying $300 more than anyone in the house on top of food costs for two teenagers? Add on the fact that she has Ipsy, other subscription boxes and constantly getting packages from Amazon but can’t feed her own kids even the basics. 

I say nothing but decide since it turns out I was never added to the lease I can go whenever. I talk to my sister and we plan for me to move in at the end of June. Once the date is set I let my roommate know she has a little more than 2 1/2 months to find someone to take over my spot and I needed to get myself on track to getting out on my own again. She is mad I would leave them in the lurch like this even though I gave her so much time find someone else to move in.

Come October she lets me know she and the others were abandoning the house. I know she blames me moving out for the upheaval (they did find someone else to take my room but they weren’t willing to take the extra responsibilities). So am I the asshole for moving out knowing she wasn’t going to feed her kids and lose the house?",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness,617
0,"AITA For Wanting to Cut My Sister Out of My Life? |  I'm 31 and my sister is 38 and lives with my parents. Things really started to come to a head about 4 years ago when my oldest son was born. He was 2 weeks early and the doctors wanted him to stay in the NICU (ultimately for about 10 days). We decided that we didn't want anyone to visit at the hospital because among other things it was very overwhelming. My sister then proceeds to guilt me into letting her make me host them at our house while my wife stays at the hospital. During said visit my sister (who didn't have a serious boyfriend) says to me that she is really jealous of me and my wife. I felt this was kind of inappropriate but decided to let it pass.

Now she lives with my parents rent free with her son.

Fast forward to fall of last year, and my parents decided that they were going to sell their RV trailer because they needed a bigger one so my sister and her son could come with them. My wife and I had been looking for an RV trailer for a while and offer to buy it, matching the highest offer they had been given thus far.  We decided to keep the trailer at my parents house over winter. Come March, my wife and I discovered she was pregnant with. We decided that since it would be difficult to have a toddler and 2 infants in the trailer, we should sell the trailer and use the money as a down payment on a minivan. I told my parents and my sister this plan she offers to sell it for us so we don't have to bother bringing it to our home several hours away.

My sister sold the trailer for double and transfers me the money but it's only what we paid for the trailer initially, I ask her why she isn't giving me the whole amount, she says we got the family discount. I bring this up to my parents who tell me that my sister needs the money and I should just drop. I'm angry but decide it's not worth it since my parents are clearly on her side.

It seems fairly insignificant but Disney plus comes out and I have 2 newborns at home and my sister calls me up and tells me that I need to share our Disney plus password and tells me that I owe her  my password since I used to use their netflix while I was in college. When I said no they got upset and called me ungrateful and say I was taking advantage of my parents.

Almost 2 months later my mother won't speak to me, because of ""how I treated her and my sister"", my sister has called and berated me for upsetting her and my mother and called me ungrateful and things that would make a sailor blush.

I finally decided that I was going to cut her out of my life when my dad calls and says that even though I don't own ""all the blame"" I need to get over it and make up with my sister, because he and my mother were upset they had yet to visit my twins despite them being almost 3 months old. When I explained to him that the 2 of them were more than welcome to visit anytime they wanted, he told me that they were a family and if she wasn't welcome, they weren't coming without her.

0,"AITA for not aligning with my In-law’s expectations of gender roles and asking my husband to stay home when our sitter calls off? | Backstory: My FIL  and husband are EQUAL business partners of a collision shop. My FIL is the lead when it comes to “back of the house” and my husband is the lead in “front of the house.” They also have two employees working for them, So everything runs real smoothly there and even if someone doesn’t show up, the shop can still run efficiently.

I work as a graphic designer in a VERY small vehicle wrap and sign shop with a total of 3 employees including myself. I get paid well, I get a lot of leniency when it comes to anything at the shop. Basically, I can do what I want as my job is getting done during business hours. I spent years on a degree, which I admit I did not need, however, I am so proud of my work and I love my job. The shop falls behind if I don’t get my tasks completed. 

We had our first/last baby in May 2019. I decided to return PART TIME after maternity leave despite the need for me to come back full time. If I cram an entire weeks worth of work into Monday through Wednesday I still fill the position effectively and I’m still valued. This lets me stay home Thursday and Friday without the worry of childcare. My mother watches our baby otherwise because she asked to. Well, while I really appreciate my mom, she is super flaky, I expected her to be. She’s good for canceling 2-3 times a month on me. So I actually have 2 backup sitters, because if I miss a day of work I set the whole shop back. 

Forward to our recent family debate, argument and eventually my blow-up: TWICE NOW all three of my sitters have been unavailable and it has come down to me or my husband staying home with our kid. My husband wouldn’t mind staying home, he’s not the problem. My FIL straight up looked me in the face and said to me, “you are the woman and the mother, it is your responsibility to stay home if you do not have a sitter.” I’m sorry but I don’t feel this way. I told him as nicely as I could that his son chose to make this baby too and it was also his responsibility. My FIL literally laughed in my face and that’s what pissed me off... I argued with him that we are living in fucking 2020 and that his beliefs on gender roles are fucking stupid. I already (and happily) miss out on two days of work. I need to be reliable for the other three I am scheduled to be there so that I am not replaced. My husband can’t be fired from his own business and it’s not like we lose money if he takes a day off occasionally on the freak occurrence that all 3 sitter options are unavailable. I screamed at him that I was sacrificing a lot for my child but I wasn’t going to give up something I love so much. I called him an asshole as he shook his head and I slammed the door. Nothing like this has ever happened, he’s been very supportive the whole 10 years I’ve been apart of the family but this seems like a no-brainer to me.

0,"AITA for unintentionally causing a girl to lose her babysitting job? | FF = Family friends

CB = Careless Babysitter

So, We're staying at FFs house because their wedding is tomorrow, and we've been here for about 5 days. FFs have 3 kids, who are extremely misbehaved and they're a lot to handle. I'm also sick, so that adds even more difficulty to the situation.

For the majority of the time I've been here, I've been babysitting the three kids and my siblings by myself while FFs and my parents prepare for the wedding.The kids as I said are very misbehaved, and they prompt the other two to act up as well. They scream, argue, cry, and generally don't listen to me when I tell them to do anything. FFs have a gym set that they're not allowed to climb on, and because they don't listen when I tell them to get off, I have to run back and forth to actually pick them up off the equipment. They get my brother, who has ADHD riled up as well, and then my brother encourages my sister to join in, so I end up having to control five misbehaving children who don't listen to me whatsoever.

When FFs came home I explained the situation to them and they said that they would get another babysitter to help me out with the kids when they go out for dinner. I was incredibly thankful. They went out for dinner and CB showed up. The first thing she did was drop her bag in the middle of the living room and sit down on her phone. The kids were going wild as always but this time it was literally happening all around her and she was doing nothing to stop it. This carried on the entire night, and not once did she step in to help. She actually found out that I was sick around halfway through the night because she came upstairs to use the bathroom while I was up there vomiting. I kinda hoped she would start helping me after seeing that I was unwell, but she continued to ignore the chaos going on around her and ultimately left me to do all the work.

Nearing the end of the night, I asked CB to help me get the oldest child to go to sleep. He wouldn't listen to me at all. He just screamed at the top of his lungs and threw a tantrum on his bed. She told me she'd be up in a minute and that she was just facetiming her friend real quick. I was angered and I knew she wasn't gonna do anything, so I managed to get him to bed myself.

FFs come home, and talk to CB. They then pay CB $100 for ""babysitting"" their kids, and I got nothing. So before she left, I told them I had actually done everything, and added that she knew I wasn't feeling well but still left all the work up to me. She called me an ass and told me that I only ratted her out because I was ""entitled"" and ""wanted her money.""  It has some truth to it I guess because I didn't think it'd be fair if I was the one working my ass off but yet got nothing while the one who sat on her ass got paid. They ended up asking the kids the next morning if CB paid attention to them, all of which said no. They apologized to me and called CB's parents to tell them that she was fired. Now I feel at fault.

0,"AITA for not paying my aunt's phone bill? | For most of my life, my aunt has a difficult time listening to me.If I'm upset about how she's talking to me and voice it, she brushes it off and says I'm being too sensitive. If I'm telling a story, she'll interrupt and ask something that had already been said.

If I tell her not to give bad foods to the dogs, she'll go ahead and do it behind my back. My mom has had 4 strokes in the last 6 years, and I've been trying to get her to eat healthy. Every 6 months is a conversation about not buying french fries, soda, etc. Just recently, my mom had a check up where her cholesterol was through the roof, and I had a conversation again about not buying all that crap. When I confront my aunt about it, she says that ""it's only one time"". It stops for a while, and then it continues. She also listens to other people before me, even though I've backed up my POV with facts and sources.

Sunday was my mom's birthday, and I told my aunt a week before to buy a vanilla cake from a specific store because my mom likes their vanilla cakes. I also tell her not to buy bad food. She agrees. Sunday comes and she calls me from a another store asking what flavor. I say vanilla, but that isn't the store I told her to go to. She says that she had plans for today and she wasn't going to go out of her way to go to some other store to get a cake I respond by saying that I had told her a week ago and that she said agreed to it, and her response was that I'm overreacting.

When she came home, she has the cake, along with a bag of french fries and soda. I ask her about it. She says that it's only for her birthday, and I say that that's why the cake was allowed. Plus, I had asked her not to buy other crap, She waves me off. 

Later on, after we've sang happy birthday, I see my aunt sneakily giving my dog cake, using her body to block my view. I tell her that she's going to kill my dog. And she says that I'm just overreacting. I just went to my room, and slammed the door closed.

Every time she doesn't listen to me, it gets increasingly worse. It went from being civil, to me making petty and shady comments, to just screaming and now slamming things. 

So I decided to no longer give her money. Monday, my mom and aunt were talking about my aunt's phone service. It had been cut off because she didn't pay the $80. Today, while I'm at work and more inclined to say yes to things because I don't want attention, my mom calls. She asks if I can pay for my aunt's phone bill, and I say no. When I tried to explain to her why, my mom interrupts me and starts saying that she was my aunt and family. I tell her that I'm trying to say why and she's not letting me. My mom ignores it and asks if I was going to pay for the bill, and I say no. She said thank you and hung up on me.

**TL;DR**: I don't want to pay for my aunt's phone bill because I feel like she's not treating me with enough respect to value how I feel and think.

0,"WIBTA if I took my Netflix away from my parents and deleting my Spotify account for them stealing my Spotify? | Throwaway for my AITA posts. 15 Male for context, so sorry if I make high school level grammatical errors and such. Also for later in the story, keep in mind my mother has my e-mail monitored so she can see whatever e-mail I receive.  I've always loved music, tv, and movies. So both Netflix and Spotify are no-brainers for a guy like me. I decided to cut a deal with my parents (in 2017 when I got it) and make it so that when I worked at my volunteer job, they would pay me minimum wage (USD 7.25). The first thing I decided to spend my well-earned money on was a Spotify Premium subscription. The counter was that it would have to be billed from my parent's bank account for the time being as I am not legally allowed to open one in my state due to the fact I'm under 16. My parents accepted the offer and so we subtracted $15 from my monthly wage to pay for my Spotify as time continued.

My grandparents are cool as far as grandparents go. They love video games, music, movies, and all of the other things I like. Eventually, in 2018, they decided to get a Netflix subscription for them and me. Soon, I decided to ask my grandparents if I could put the account on to my parent's tv service so my family and I could watch anything we so desired, they accepted to my surprise. I, therefore, did what I got permission to do and put our account on to my parent's living room TV so we could watch more media.

Fast forward to now, my mother ends up changing my Spotify password so she can use it to listen to music in the car(even though she has been perfectly content with using the radio for years!). I don't mind the fact that she wants to listen to music, but I pay for that with my own money and her taste in music and mine are very different (I like old stuff from the 1930s all the way to the 1980s while she prefers the stuff most people listen to nowadays, which is not the kind of thing I can stand to listen to{not to offend anyone}). Also, she listens to it ALL DAY and Spotify only allows your account to be used once at a time. So now I keep getting recommended rap music, my friends keep questioning my apparent change in taste of music, and I can't listen to music on my account as my mother keeps stealing it. Whenever I talk to her about it, she says that she pays for it so she gets to use it. Which is not true!\^\^\^

(Side note: they also are annoyed I won't give them the password to the Netflix so they can use it on their other devices)

So, I've been thinking, and I believe I have a fair plan. My grandparents are fine with me paying them money to support my Spotify account until I can get a bank account. So I personally see it fit to delete my Spotify account, start a new personal e-mail to run a new one and other services off of, and delete the Netflix from the Living Room TV. Does this seem a fair punishment to them after I have asked them to stop using something I pay for and they get greedy with the Netflix they don't own?

I was currently on wanting to fix, even going as far as asking him how hard it would be to fix ourselves, watching a few videos about it, and looking at prices for parts. He was aware of my feelings, I involved him totally.

  Well exactly one day after selling my beloved car he comes home and tells me hes not able to work anymore as hes in too much pain. I wasnt aware he was in that much pain as he made no effort to get looked at prior to this convo. Hes said hes been in similar pain for years and made no effort to get checked out before all this despite having excellent health coverage. He only says hes in more pain. I found it odd that it was so conveniently after I've just received quite a bit of money for my car. But I did not mention my feeling about that at the time, but I have now. But he promised that I could just get another car. 

  But as time went on and I tried to actually get another car, he shot down every car I suggested. Right from a decent used car from a dealership to craigslist and facebook jalopies. All this is happening while I'm slowly depleting the money I have for another car by supporting our household because I dont make enough to support everyone on my paycheck alone. Before this all happened the expenses were split pretty 50/50. Hes always known that I couldnt support us all by myself. So in theory it'd have been very bad for him to be out of work. Had I not sold my car.

  Now that he's ready to rejoin the workforce and received his lost wages for the last 5 months, we've been talking about all the late bills we'll need to catch up on. And another car. Because now he needs the car we do have. While I'm left out in the literal cold to bum rides home from work and uber, which is further depleting my savings. 

  So when I asked if we'd be getting me another car, he blew up. He was even calling me mean names. After awhile I couldnt take the mindfuck anymore and started calling him names back, I do admit. He said I'm being greedy for asking and I should just save up on my own if I want another car. How I was the one that had wanted to sell my car. He started saying if I wanted I could have gotten another car anytime I wanted. He said me showing him cars that were in my price range never happened. And that I'm constantly treating him like shit for asking him to take some of the stress off me by trying to make money anyway he could or doing chores around the house.

  Ive literally spent all the money i had set aside for another car to take care of us while he wasnt working. Am I the asshole for expecting him to repay me by helping with a down payment?",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness,595
0,"WIBTA for telling my roommate to remove his belongings from the room I pay for? | I live in a 3 bedroom (2 upstairs, 1 downstairs) house with 2 room mates, one of which is my partner. I was the last roomie to move in when their previous friend moved out. When i came into the house i assumed all of the old room mates bills for internet, utilities, rent, etc. Our room mate (T) lives in one of the bedrooms upstairs and my partner and I sleep in the bedroom downstairs together, and I have kept the other room upstairs (that is technically the room that I am renting) as mostly a sensory/decompression/meditation/reading/crafting space that doubles as a guest bedroom for when friends come over. It doesn't have a lot of things in it, just a mattress and some personal items of mine that I use when it's time for some ""me"" time. T is a bit of a hoarder and has stuff overflowing from his bedroom (upstairs) into the hallway, lining his living room space, stuffing his cabinet space, the garage etc. I don't mind the clutter as he keeps it organized and keeps it in his own spaces.

I had fallen into a depressive state the last few months and had not been using the room much because i had lacked the motivation to do the things I enjoy.

Upon going upstairs I saw that T has started moving his crafting supplies into the room, completely lining one of the walls and making the room smell of leather, dye and other unpleasant chemicals. I was never told, asked or even aware that he had started doing this or when exactly it occurred. His crafting supplies also fill the garage, upstairs hallway and most of his own personal space. It had even been brought up in the past when he asked a few months ago what we plan on using the room for and suggested a crafting room and he was told sorry, no, it would be a personal decompression space.

I am a person that takes my coziness very seriously and I can not use the room for its purposes when I can barely breathe when I walk into the room, so just pretending it isn't there is not going to work for me unfortunately. The room may not have been used much over the last several weeks, but I do not believe that makes it free storage space. Luckily, I am also on the tail end of this depressive cycle and can see the room being in use in the very near future for my own projects. I am at the point of telling him to remove his belongings or be prepared to pay for that space's rent as well (i wouldn't put my portion of rent on him just for the room, but I think he absolutely should be paying more rent for using more space.) I have been forgiving about the space he and his belongings take up until this point, but I think I have reached my limit on this one. I do not know if he took it upon himself to move his things in there or if he asked my partner who said he could (still waiting on an answer before I tell T to remove his things) but I don't think that really matters, if he was told yes it was a miscommunication and the situation still needs to be rectified.

T needs to move his stuff, or he needs to pay more rent. AITA?",False,False,3,5,2,4,2,4,Fairness,595
0,"AITA for getting mad when my parents use my money to pay bills? | So first post here, a little context. I (21f) live with my parents since they agreed to pay for my schooling as long as I didn’t move out. They’re helicopter parents, and even went so far as to buy me a car as a bribe to stay local for college. I work part time as a ride operator at a theme park centered around plastic brick toys (since I’m a full time student), and while I don’t make nearly enough to be able to move out on this salary, I’m putting nearly all of it away into savings so I can move out. My parents have always been very overbearing, going so far as to demand access to my bank account so they can “monitor my spending”. When I first opened my current account at 18, I asked the banker if they would be able to take money out of my account, and she assured me that they would only be able to put money in.

Fast forward to today. I was helping my mom with laundry, and my dad brought up the stimulus check that he just received, and how he’s using it to pay off bills due this month. I made a comment about how it’s good that we’re going to be able to pay this month, because of reduced income. Then he hits me with the bombshell.

Dad: Oh I wasn’t really all that worried. If I needed the cash, I was just going to pull it out of your account.
Me: .......what?
Dad: Yeah, and the best part is you don’t even notice! I pay it back anyway. Eventually...
Me: That money is what I’m saving up to be able to move out once I graduate! When I started this job you said I should put it away and not touch it!
Dad: I said you shouldn’t touch it. Not that I wouldn’t. Besides, if you want to keep driving that car, and using that phone, you’ll have to just let me take it.

I got upset by this and refused to continue the conversation. While it’s true that my parents bought me the car, my dad did tell me that I would only be allowed to keep it if I kept living with them, and went to college for what they wanted. And my phone, well I didn’t see anything wrong with the old one I had that I paid for. The current one I have was supposedly a Christmas present. I do use the electricity and water and such in the house, but never have they indicated that I needed to pay my share in it. If they had I would have been understanding, if less enthused, but then I would at least have a baseline for what I’m paying them. So far I’ve seen charges on my account from them ranging from 200 dollars to 800 dollars, and doing the math on the deposits they make, I’m still several hundred dollars short. This would be fine if they would just charge me rent, but going behind my back like this feels like theft...

I haven’t brought it up to my parents since, but it really bothers me that they essentially consider my savings to be a resource for them to use since they can’t manage their money effectively.

0,"AITA For moving countries when my friend is a single mother and relying on me | So this is a throwaway

I'm just gonna jump right into the story:

I (29F) have a friend (28F) I will call Stacy here. Stacy and I have been friends for over a decade now and I do love her, I would say she is one of my best friends. Stacy got pregnant by a fling about five years ago and decided to go on with the pregnancy and keep the child, although it was clear from the beginning that the father would not be in this kid's life. He has nothing to do with the kid or Stacy.

I am childfree. I get along with kids well, but I never wanted any of my own, because I don't like how they affect everything you do in life.  
 

While Stacy was pregnant my roommate at that time moved out and Stacy asked to move in, just for about one year til she gets back on her feet. To be honest I did not like the idea of living with a newborn at all, but Stacy was desperate and I wanted to be a good friend. Stacy moved in while she was in the last trimester of her pregnancy. I helped her a lot, I was with her when she gave birth and basically helped her raise this child, who is now four years old. Stacy did not have a job at that time, so I was paying rent and for almost everything else she and the kid needed, she got a little help from the state, but in our country if you life together you are on the hook, so most expenses were covered by me. This was pretty expensive, but I pulled through, because I wanted to be a good friend. Back then I just got my degree and started working, so I earned money and we managed. I love Stacy and the kid and I always wanted to help them, but I will be honest and admit that this made me somewhat resentful. I never wanted kids and am now financing and supporting a child I never decided to have. Stacy always found a reason why she cannot move out and I let it slide.  
 

This affects me a lot, I do a lot of childcare for her, I have way less free time than I would have if there wasn’t a kid living with me and I have way more expenses, because although Stacy has a job now, I cover way more of our bills than she does.  
 

I always had this dream of moving to a specific country and decided I will do it as soon as this situation we are in right now allows it. Last week I talked to Stacy about it and told her. Since this was always my plan I expected her to somehow understand. She flipped at me. She cried and screamed how I cannot leave her and the kid, how she cannot raise a kid on her own, how she does not want to be a single mother, how she cannot pay all the bills. She said I am running away from responsibilities. This made me so angry. This is not my kid, she IS a single mother, I never wanted a child and this child should not be my responsibility.

0,"AITA For not letting my niece stay over with me? | Ok, so let me preface this by saying that I absolutely love my eldest niece (we'll call her ''M''), she's like my little sister. But my sister (her mom, we'll call her ''G'') takes advantage of that.

A little bit of backstory: ''G'' is married to this terrible guy 10 years younger than her and they have two girls under the age of 3 (''M'' is not his daughter). He's straight up not a nice guy, and complains all the time about having to take care of the two little girls and about ''M'' on a regular basis. Also, everyone in my family is a musician, meaning we work all day saturdays, and we're split into two groups ''M'' is in one, and ''G'' is in another one. ''G'' lives with my niece ''M'', the two girls and her husband in their own house. In my house there are currently 10 people living here.

Now, here goes:

I love it when ''M'' stays over. When she does, we sleep in my queen size bed, which I have to tidy up when she sleeps over, and I have no issue cleaning up my bed when she's staying under a direct invitation from me (we go to a lot of cons and outings that require her to stay over out of convenience). The big but, is that when we're working on saturdays ''G'' takes off and goes home and leaves ''M'' here, with no regard of where she'll sleep, and she usually ends up sleeping with me, which means I have to clean up my bed even though I was not expecting ''M'' to stay over. Mind you, we regularly finish working late, so this happens at like 1 or 2 A.M. ''G'' says she's tired and wants to sleep, like I'm not tired too. 

&#x200B;

''G'' does this almost every week without consulting anyone and ''M'' just shows up and stays because ''G'' couldn't be bothered to pick her up after work (it's a family business), and the only reason I put up with it is because I don't want her sleeping on the couch, given the fact that we're so crowded in here. It's not just for work either, ''G'' will have ''M'' come over to my house after a party, an outing, or something and she's just like ''Oh yeah, M is staying over. She's sleeping with you right?''

I feel like I'm being taken advantage of for permitting this. I don't mind having my niece over, I love her and I love her company, but I don't enjoy that her mom just drops her off whenever she feels like it. I could have ''M'' sleeping in my bed for a month, if I'm the one inviting her over, because when she stays over with me specifically, I take care of her every need, and when ''G'' does this, I feel like I'm being thrusted with a responsibility I don't want to take at the time. I can't possibly bring this up with ''G'' because if I do, she'll bad mouth me to ''M'' and I'll be the bad guy. This has been going on for literal years, and yesterday I found myself in this exact situation and I said a firm ''No'' to ''M'' sleeping with me, resulting in her sleeping somewhere else in the house.

0,"AITA for holding this grudge against my dad from a decade ago | Ten years ago my stepmom accused me of stealing money from my stepbrother. I was 19 at that time, my stepbrother is a month younger. The whole thing was a set up, my stepmom told me it was. She and I had a fight the day before and she told me to just watch what she can do. The next day I got back from work and was met with the accusation that I've stolen thousands of dollars from my stepbrother. My parents kept our money in a lock box in their room with the key hidden. I also had a bank account so I had my own debit card for gas and a little spending money but 90% of my money went into the box. Stepmom claimed thousands of dollars were missing from my stepbrothers money in the lock box. After days of fighting it was determined that there was no proof I stole it but I would be punished anyway. My dad sat me down at the kitchen table to tell me my punishment as my stepmom stood behind him with the biggest smile,dancing and flipping me off. First was that they were cutting off paying for my college. They had already paid for my first and second semester at a community college but they took that money back out of my money. They also took away my debit card and gave me a strict allowance of only gas money to get to work, this included keeping track of my odometer calculating it down to the mile. This was to go on until I moved out which I did about a year later. 
  News was spread around that I was a thief and friends and family distanced themselves, plus I could not go out with no money and being tracked. I was doing well in college but I was not allowed to go back until I moved out and could have control of my own money. There are many reasons I rarely have communicated with my parents the past 10 years but this is one of the bigger ones. My dad has been trying to get me to meet with him and talk things out, mostly because he wants to see his grandaghter. My brothers car broke down so Ive been giving him rides to my parents house. This time I got stuck there talking to my dad. He asked me whats going on with me ignoring him and everything so I tried to talk. First thing I brought up was the situation explained above and my dad and brother laughed out loud at me. Dad said he cant believe I still think about that and that its a long time to hold something agaist him. I told him if we cant even get passed that there's no point talking and left. My brother texted me throughout the night and today trying to get me to come back and talk more, he says 10 years is a long time to hold that against my dad and I should leave it in the past. They say even with what happened its my own fault for not finishing college and moving out. Just thinking about it, 10 years does sound like a long time to hold on to somthing and plenty of people do put themselves through college under worse circumstances. So now im wondering if I am wrong to hold this particular grudge from ten years ago against him.

0,"AITA Parents bought younger sister with serious issues a 25k car for Christmas while all I got was a phone case, been needing a car for a couple years, parents promised one, but gave her one instead | In my family there are 2 kids (sister and I) and my parents. Christmas was coming up and I’ve been wanting a car for about a year now because I’ve recently gotten my Green P’s (Australian thing that you can get when you’re older than 18). My parents have mentioned in the past the idea of me paying for half and they’ll cover the other half of a car under total 10k AUD, I can afford this as I’ve saved most of my money from the 2 jobs I’ve kept since I was 14, so no biggie. I’ve also been relying on my mum to drive me to work for the last 4 years, so it was a smart move on their end rather then driving me the 30 mins each way every shift I’ve got.

My sister has just turned 17, which is when you can get your red P’s in Australia, shes never had a job and has no money saved whatsoever. I love her a lot but she’s made some questionable decisions toward her future lately, but that’s a seperate story. My parents haven’t seemed to care as much as they probably should have about these things, and are acting like everything’s normal and all good.

With Christmas coming up at the time and my birthday in early January I thought this might be the time my parents get me that car I’ve wanted for the last year, as they’ve mentioned this idea for the last couple months. I’m obviously excited the week leading up to Christmas wondering what type of car they’ve bought or what they’re looking at. 

I wake up Christmas Day around 10am to the sound of my younger sister crying but in a happy way. I’m excited for her as she’s obviously gotten something she’s wanted, I walk downstairs and no ones at the Christmas tree, but a present with my name is sitting there. I figure I’ll come back to it after I find my parents. Check the front door and it’s wide open, walk out to the drive way to see a brand new blue Hyundai i30 sitting in the driveway with a big ribbon on the front (around 25k), my sister is at the side of it crying with my parents arms around her. I ask who it’s for and my parents tell me her, I probably could have handled this better but I stormed back into the house, closed my door and stayed in there for the rest of the day, didn’t go with my family to see everyone else for Christmas because of how annoyed I was.

My parents asked me why I did that when they got home, so I asked them why they bought her a car before me, who’s older, willing to pay half, had a job, goes to school and has a stable plan for the future. They don’t have an answer to that one so they just stay quite and after a couple of minutes of awkward silence they walk out. By this point I forgotten about the present they left under the tree downstairs, so I walk down to open it, and it’s a new phone case from eBay, something I had no use for, I can't get over what they've done.

0,"AITA for complaining and not wanting to help out with my nephew | I’m (17F) and out for the summer. I’m kind of an introvert and it’s known in my family. But I’ve wanted to make the summer going into my senior year count and make good memories. 

I also wanted to relax and spend time alone. Recently my older sister has gotten divorced and she’s switched from a part time job to a full time so she works during the morning. 

Every day.. Monday through Friday I have to wake up around 6ish am to start my day of caring for her child (2M). I take care of him from 6ish am to around 5 pm. Sometimes 6 pm.. depending on who come gets him and when. 

I think this is pretty unfair. I also wanted to get a job this summer to get some job experience but that plan was nipped in the bud. I love my nephew. And I don’t mind watching him occasionally. But I’m so tired of this. I’ve been doing this since I got out for the summer in May. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. And I’ve expressed it plenty of times but I get shut down every time by my parents because they say there’s no one else to do it. 

Apparently I’m an asshole for complaining and I get hit with the life isn’t fair. 

I’m not trying to be insensitive towards her and I know she’s having a hard time adjusting but fuck! 

I think I’m going to go crazy soon. My daily schedule consists of waking up at 6. Taking his clothes off. If he cries when he gets here I deal with it. I make his food and I feed him. And then I attempt to get him to go back to sleep. I change his diapers during these times and play with him. I make sure he goes outside at least a few times during the week. At some point he goes down for a nap and I continue to feed him. 

He can only eat finger food by himself. I’m not patient so I get frustrated having to feed him by hand. It takes so long. 

I also brush his teeth, wash his face, and do his hair. 

It sucks so much to be trapped with a toddler 5 days a week. At this point he’s seeing me more than he sees anyone else. I don’t have a child. I didn’t sign up for this. 

I just want to be irresponsible and sleep until 11 AM and play video games all day and chill with my friends. Maybe even work and make some money. I don’t want to be a mom. 

I’m a passive person. So dealing with tantrums and the crying is so hard. I keep getting told by the adults around me to be more sympathetic toward her and that this will pass. But no one has made any plans to send him to a daycare. 

So I’ve started complaining a lot and talking about how I want to do this in hopes of another arrangement being made but I get told to suck it up. 

Even before she got a divorce I’d get tricked into watching my nephew for hours.

A can be a very nice, caring person and good listener but also selfish and entitled, especially when it comes to doing work for/with her. Also she's the type of person who will always ask for your advice but will literally do the exact opposite of what you told her.

Actual story: about two weeks ago, we were at a club (basically our entire year was there, as we are graduating soon). Until 10pm, all cocktails were 50% off. I arrived at about 9:15. A greeted me by telling me that there was no space at her table for me, but no where else either as she hadn't reserved a seat for me (thanks, I guess?). Afterwards, I immediately got in line for some drinks. A was right in front of me and at about 9:30 it was her turn to order. She ordered at least 15 cocktails. The bartender started taking her order and A was being an annoying customer. Why? While ordering A would ask what was in every single kind of cocktail and how it was made. This question-answer-game took about 5-10 minutes. Finally the bartender started making the drinks slowly.

A kept interrupting her and asking why she was doing whatever she was doing at that moment. Another 10 minutes pass and not even half the drinks are made. People in line are becoming impatient.
It's 9:45 and A looks at her watch, turns around to us and says in the most smug way possible with a grin on her face ""oh well, you guys only have 10 minutes left, you better hurry up"". Another five minutes pass. Again A turns around ""well, that'll be close for you"". At 9:58, all the drinks are made. All A had to do was pay. A and another girl decided to split the bill and started arguing about who would pay what.
9:59, they start getting their small change out. They pay all the drinks that way which takes at least another two minutes. Well, happy hour might be over, but this story sure isn't.
I decided to pull a Karen and wanted to speak to the manager, A friend and I went looking for him and we met A, who asked us what we were doing. I told her and she replied ""hm, at least I still got MY drinks, so I'm fine"" while grinning and trying to blow me a kiss. I slapped her hand away and told her to fuck off.

A later comes up to me, telling me she's sorry I'm upset but it's not her fault, The bartender was being fast and I shouldn't be mad. She then offered me one of her drinks that I could just pay her for. I refused. 
About 20 minutes later A comes to me and starts yelling at me. She thinks it's stupid that I'm upset about that, I tell her to leave, she yells that she won't unless I'm not upset anymore about something stupid like this. I lost it and also yelled at her, telling her to fuck off. She then returns to her table and loudly tells people there how dumb I am being. Later she texted me, wanting to talk.

I make around $800/month, but am very good when it comes to saving money and spending my money wisely. This has led to me lending money to family members (parents/siblings) when they’re really struggling, but for my parents and younger sister, they rarely ask (maybe once every couple of months) and always pay me back on the day we agreed on. On the other hand, my older sister (22) and her boyfriend (\~30) ask me for money multiple times a month, and when I do lend them money they never pay me back on time and then ask for more money just a few days later.

Recently, my older sister and her boyfriend have been struggling a lot financially. Her boyfriend got into a car accident and was deemed at fault, so his insurance only covered a small amount of the damages. Due to this, he lost his only means of transportation and was no longer able to work. He applied for EI but hasn’t heard back yet. My sister is on disability and receives enough to cover her rent, bills and food, with around $150 left for other expenses each month. They both smoke cigarettes and weed, and get take out for most meals, so they blow any extra money they have just a couple days after she gets her cheque.

Since her boyfriend lost his job, he has been messaging me nonstop asking to lend him money. I explained to him that I only have enough in my checking account to cover my expenses until my next payday, and if I touch my savings I will get charged a fee for it, so I can lend him money when I get paid next if he still needs it. He messaged me daily for the 5 next days asking over and over again for me to lend him anywhere from $50-200 and I told him the same thing each time.

I spoke to my mom about it and she told me that they have been doing the same to her and my dad and they have been saying no each time. My mom has been helping them financially since they got together a few years ago and even let them live at my parents house until they could afford an apartment. Both my mom and I helped them with stuff for their apartment and I even took a day off to help them move. My mom told me not to lend them money anymore, so they will learn to manage their money and save, rather than relying on my family to help them whenever they are broke.

I got paid yesterday and woke up to a message from both of them asking me to lend them $200. I told them no, and that I wasn’t gonna lend them money anymore unless it was an emergency. This led to my sister calling me and screaming at me over the phone saying I promised them I would help and all this stuff. I told her that they need to go and get jobs and stop wasting all their money on junk they don’t need.

0,"AITA for not wanting to buy my mom a house? | Basically, some stuff in my childhood was pretty traumatizing and involved my uncle.

I told my mom by accident in March 2018.  In summer 2019, my mom wanted to begin a civil court case and I signed for her to speak for me in court. I was grateful but a little uncomfortable with her need for vengeance. She expressed she wanted to ruin my uncle financially. This used to be my fantasy, but when I moved away for college in 2018 I finally felt peace and let it drop.  During winter 2019 she told me my uncle had agreed to start negotiating a settlement.

She started the conversation with “You have to trust me.”  ... and talked about how money can split people apart.  She told me how much money she hoped to get and how she would insure the money‘s safety and I wouldn’t have full access since I’m young and stuff.

She THEN started talking about how she wanted to use the money to buy a house in another state so she and my sister can move away for a fresh start. She made it sound like it would be an “investment”  for me to be a “homeowner” but something doesn’t sit right with me. I don’t like the idea of her taking the settlement money (an uncertain quantity) to start a new life. She kept saying “honey, I’ve never had my own house to live in, I’ve worked so hard my whole life with nothing to show for it, this house could make a difference”.  Tbh, it feels like blood money and if I receive it, I want to pay for my schooling and save the rest for when I need it. I don’t want a car/ new apartment.

I am not against giving my parents money. I’ve been working full time since May 2019 to pay for college and support myself. The settlement would cover my tuition and pay off my parents’s loans + some nice vacations or something. 

My mom pushed to take this to civil court, it feels like this was maybe her plan all along. I feel like she’s somehow profiting from my pain and taking this as a “win” in her life.

I’m still not sure about whether my mom is capable of taking the money when it’s issued. I’m just stressed (the negotiations start next month) because she has a lot of sway over me and I’m not sure if I could deny her if it came down to it, especially since it could totally wreck our complex relationship. 

I haven’t really spoken to her about how I feel yet- I know she is not going to take it well. In addition, the actual amount of settlement might not match up with what she’s demanding and she might be getting her hopes up. I love my mom and I’m afraid my discomfort means I’m being selfish/greedy.

TL;DR

My mom wants to buy a house “for me” (that she will live in) with settlement money. the case is something she said she is doing for me, against my uncle.

0,"AITA for walking out of a dinner party with my boyfriend's family, because of something his Uncle said to me? | I went to a dinner party with my boyfriend's extended family last weekend. I've met a lot of the family already last year at Thanksgiving. 

At the dinner, I was talking to my boyfriend's Aunt and Uncle about what I do (systems engineering for nuclear power plants) and then his Uncle said something pretty gross about how the guys there must like having a pretty young lady to look at. 

Now I admit that hit a sore spot for me. I have had some crappy experiences with coworkers not respecting me because I'm a young woman.

I firmly said to my boyfriend's Uncle ""I don't care for how you just spoke to me; I better not hear anything like that again"". I was trying to be firm but respectful; speaking to him in the same way I'd speak to someone at work who said something I didn't appreciate. And he got kind of stubborn, saying he was just paying me a compliment. By this point, everyone was staring.

I was feeling pretty mad and I realized it would be a better call to walk away rather than escalate. So I said ""excuse me, I'm going to take a walk before I say something I'll regret."" And I went and grabbed my shoes and purse and went for a walk.

I'd already been having a really bad week before this, my best friend moved out of town and I missed her a lot, my apartment had been partially flooded by a plumbing issue, I was exhausted from the long drive the night before. And this thing, that should have been a little annoyance, was like the straw that broke the camel's back for me. 

I started crying when I walked. I texted my best friend to tell her I missed her. She called me right away and could tell I was upset, and we talked for a while as I wandered. Talking to her made me feel a lot better, and after catching up for about 20 minutes, I noticed my phone was dying, and I ought to have been getting back, so I said bye.

My phone died right after we hung up, and I started making my way back to my boyfriend's house. But I must have taken a wrong turn as I tried to backtrack my steps; I was lost in suburban sprawl.

I saw the church steeple in the distance, and I realized that if I went to the church, the train station was close by. And I knew my way to my boyfriend's family's house from the station. So I took that roundabout way back. By the time I got back, I'd been out for about two hours.

I got back and my boyfriend was upset with me for being gone for so long, not answering calls, and generally for walking out rather than doing something less dramatic. I told him about my phone dying, about getting lost, and he was still upset with me. I'd made things very uncomfortable at the party when I was gone. 

I apologized and said I'd tried to walk off to deescalate things, and it wasn't my intention to end up doing the exact opposite. But he was still upset with me for being a drama queen, which I don't think is fair.

0,"AITA for not looking after my landlord's dog when I always used to? | Landlord has a dog, we love her. We used to look after her a lot as they go on numerous vacations a year. We train her, she’s smart and picks up behaviours well. When she goes home it isn't carried on and when we have her again we work on it (waiting when we put her bowl down etc.), we also clean her water and food bowls as they’re often mouldy.

A few months back I asked if it would be okay for us to get a dog of our own, we look after theirs and they trust us. We live on farmland with lots of space. They said no as a dog may scratch our floor, the wife told me a week later she has not got enough time for her dog, she is trying to get a project off the ground and they worry if we got a dog it would bark, and set their dog off and that would impact her work. They shut the dog in a room of their house which makes her bark more than usual.

Shortly after they approached me when my fiancé wasn’t home, they offered me their dog on a timeshare. I felt they were trying to take advantage of me as we’d expressed a wish for a dog of our own. They wanted us to have their dog when they're away and I walk her for them as then we get “the joy” of having a dog without responsibility. Their dog gets confused when she isn’t staying with us, as they yell at her when she tries to come and see us, we live open plan so when she is outside she is free to approach us. We really wanted a dog of our own and not to share someone else's, mainly as it does confuse her.

I got several messages after asking me at very short notice (an hour before) to have their dog, I had to say no as we weren’t home or were not available. I offered to bring their dog to wherever we were going but they were quite rude in their replies if I said I couldn't. We are now not allowed to pet their dog when she comes to our side of the fence.

They have asked if we would take their dog for a week as they have a lot of work, I declined. We could have her but I feel out of principle they shouldn't just get free dog-care from me when I'm also working at home. I said it would not be any more beneficial for the dog, I suggested I could collect her and take her on an evening walk with me. They recently got chickens and it seems that this has further impacted the level of care for the dog, I thought this would be a good opportunity for them to tend to the chickens uninterrupted. I received a rude response telling me not to bother and basically a “thanks for not helping us”.

Ever since, they’re blanking us. Their dog came to see us today and the wife screamed at her and said “GET AWAY FROM THEM”, I said “oh don’t worry we are happy to say hello!” and the wife muttered under her breath 'only when it suits you'.

0,"AITA for telling my mom to get a lawyer for her will so my brother doesn’t screw me over for my inheritance? | My parents are not rich by any means but they made very smart investments in properties in India. They have about a million dollars invested in India and they’re currently in the process of selling everything over there and bringing it over to the U.S. now. They’re looking for real estate to invest in the U.S. 

Because of this, my brother (22M) and I (16F) have a decent inheritance. My mom made it clear that she wouldn’t just give us straight up money, but rather pay for undergrad and grad school if we needed it, our weddings, and also the down payment of our first house. All properties that they still have would be divided equally between my brother and me. 

Now my brother has taken upon himself to find these properties. He just searches real estate websites for properties and shows them to my mom. He found one recently that my parents liked and they were looking into investing. Now here’s the issue:

He argued that the property should go to him eventually because he was the one who found it. But he literally just searched on a real estate website for a couple hours and found it. I understand wanting a commission or something, but him getting the whole property just seems ridiculous to me. 

This was shocking to both my mom and me because she’s made it abundantly clear that everything will be split 50-50 so him suddenly demanding the whole thing for a few hours work is appalling. 

It should also be made clear that my brother has no idea what he wants to do. He’s switched career paths like probably 4 times in the last year, and the only thing he really cares about is traveling. So I think he’s just trying to land this property so he can travel and not have to worry about actually having a job since the income from the property would fund his traveling. 

He got really mad that she said this (admittedly, the way she reacted was not kindly) and refused to forward the details of the property. 

So I got really upset that he’s trying to take what we agreed was ours, so I told my mom that she should get a lawyer to figure out her will and have it taken care of legally. At this point, she hadn’t because she thought it was clear that we knew what she wanted for us and that we would respect it. She agreed and said she would look into it after all this craziness dies down.

My brother flipped out and said that we were making a big deal out of nothing and that there is no reason to spend all that money on legal fees. My dad agreed especially since traditionally in India, property goes to the firstborn son and I would get all the gold and jewelry. 

As in typical Indian affairs, all of our family and family friends got involved and think my mom and I are being ridiculous because getting lawyers for wills is unheard of and maybe even “disrespectful to my elder brother”. 

That made me rethink whether I made the right choice, especially since my parents are still young and so are my brother and I. Maybe this won’t be an issue when we fully grow up.

0,"AITA for refusing to help my mom on this project? | Over the past three weeks my sister and I've been painting my parent's house. We started in the dining room then moved to the large entryway/living room area which requires us the work on scaffolding as the walls are so high. it's also a really awkward room with lots of ornate moulding. It's been a grueling few weeks and my mom gets really angry whenever we ask for a break. We've had 2 breaks in this time, and she still brings it up as us being lazy. 

I started this project being really upfront with her: I want to be able to fit in reasonable stopping points between projects. Aka I'm starting this project ONLY and once I'm done I want a break to focus on myself for a few days before moving on to the next project. I don't mind doing these projects but I want to spend time for myself too.

I said that because she likes to start projects then feverishly push people to finish them. Then she starts another project in the middle of the first project, then another, so the cycle of work never really ends, and god forbid you take a break with something unfinished. It's also a really chaotic method of working. I prefer doing things orderly as it keeps my own anxiety down.

Well, mom decided to start painting the kitchen (of course.) She claimed it was just her own project and that we don't have to help her. Thing is she can't do much because of her health, so she constantly asks us to stop what we're doing and help her. I told her over and over again that I'm not willing to start on the kitchen until I finish the front room. She seemed to relent with that at first.

This morning though mom came to me and said, ""hey can you ask your sister to help me tape around the cabinets?"" I was hesitant because my sister is even less enthusiastic about these projects than I am. 

Of course my sister refused because it's just too much work right now, but mom flew off the handle. She was calling us lazy and ungreatful. she was throwing insult after insult, and denying any of the work we've done so far.

*""You only do these things because I'll scream at you if you don't!""*

We had a similar fight before when my mom and I disagreed on the exact method for painting the dining room (paint one half of the room, than the other. Moving the furnature in between)

My oldest sibling who doesn't live here anymore was trying to give me advise about it and said, ""Treat this like an improv show. You always want to say *yes, but* but that's the same as saying *no*. Try saying *yes, and* instead.""

I just don't understand her logic though. While ""yes and"" can prevent a fight in the short term, it has been wrecking my mental health trying to keep up with mom's demands. if I say ""yes and when would be a good time to start?"" she'll say ""right now"". If I ask for a break I'm crewed out unless I literally have a panic attack. If I don't put my foot down about her parrallel projects, then I'll start having a mental break down.

0,"WIBTA for outing my best friend as scammer and possibly messing up her livelihood? | First post here, please be kind. 

I've known my friend Joyce for over about 10 years. We met through a mutual friend and just clicked and became very close to a point of calling each other sisters.  I found out she's a liar. It was always small white lies I didn't care about such as her age, things about her kids, past, etc. I noticed the stories she told didn't make sense as her kids contradicted her. 

The scam: She got into making reborn babies. She made/sold them for couple of years and was doing well according to her. She claimed one of her daughters messed up her Etsy account and couldn't use etsy. I had an account with hundreds of ratings and offered to let her use it to sell her reborn babies. She took over my etsy and started getting a lot of orders very fast as Christmas is only few months away. Despite getting large amount of orders, I noticed she was not working on the dolls. I asked her and she said she ordered the supplies. She was also selling on her website.

Long story short, by early December, she had over 70 Christmas dolls to make and send and she had completed ONE. I helped her organize the Christmas orders and made everything easier for her.

Somehow all the dolls were out by Christmas in less than 10 days. The quality was severely lacking to say the least. Myself and my DH, her husband and even her DIL helped her for the last week. I was working with her 18-20 hours a day and my DH was helping make some parts she never ordered. 

After Christmas, I helped her organize again fshe stopped sending out any orders after January. Some disputes were open due to quality of the dolls. And because she made so much etsy required SSN or tax ID and she used her business tax ID number so it's not tied to me at all.

I found out between the Christmas orders and ordered that were never sent, etsy refunded about $36k to buyers and is now owed to etsy. Few weeks ago, I found out she was getting letters from the AG office and got curious and looked up her original website. Turns out she had a lot of people on BBB complaining of never receiving orders. I checked BBB on other websites she had and same thing. People were saying she would deliberately tell them 90 days or 120 days to get them out and by then, the dispute timeframe was over on whatever platform they used to pay. Aside from etsy, she scammed another $15k minimum and these are only the ones on BBB. 

She talked about a group on book of faces for scammers that  is very active and large and I want to out her there. This was all 2017-2018 but I know she did some shady things last Christmas too, just don't have as much info as I do for 2017. This may mess with her livelihood.  Her husband makes enough to pay the bills but doesn't want to work. WIBTA if I joined scamming groups to out her?

Fay asked if I wanted to shoot for a 2 day corporate event. I would receive $25 ph and another goodie bag, same rate. I said yes as the last event was fun. I asked my boyfriend, call him Joe, to help. We'd split the cash, be reimbursed for travel, and were each promised a goodie bag. 

The event was awful. We worked 24 hours in 2 days. We were expected to have edited photos from the 1st day (ending 10pm) by the 2nd day (starting 6:30am). Joe left halfway through the 2nd day because the stress of the event set off a panic attack. We edited about a 1000 photos and sent them to Fay.

A couple months passed, I tried to contact Fay several times to hang out and ask about payment. Joe and I had spent $170 on Ubers, with Fay's approval. After a while, I called her out on ghosting me. She then
 told me a guy in accounting messed up, she didn't go through proper channels to hire us, that there was no money in the budget for us, and that her boss told her to just not pay us.

She owned up that it was mostly her fault not going through proper channels and wanted to pay us back herself. I decided that she should just pay me back for the Ubers, as we all were financially struggling. I thought it reasonable to compensate only money we lost. 

I reached out to Fay several times after that, trying to set up payment. She always stated that she was struggling finanically but would keep us updated and would send me money. I agreed to give her time. I went back to my home town with Joe for a long visit. Four months later, no word. 

Yesterday, I sent to her work email an invoice and letter of demand. I stated she had 2 months to pay me back for the Ubers and if any of our photos were used, I wanted full compensation for hours worked ($700). If an agreement was not reached, I may escalate further (contact bosses, Fair Work, and possibly take it to small claims). 

She was furious that I emailed her ""threatening to sue"" her and how I was a terrible friend for not considering her financial crisis. She called me out on how the ramifications of this would hurt her more than it would hurt me (she could lose her job vs. I could lose the money). I should be ""thankful"" for the opportunity she gave me to work with such a high profile company. 

 She works where min. wage is $18 ph, I know she makes more. I work 3 jobs in my home town to save money. Min. wage is $8. She constantly posts instas at bars/restaurants.

I'm (17F) the eldest child, and so basically have been a live in nanny/ babysitter / parent no. 3 for my siblings (15F and 12M) since I was 12/13. 

My Dad was (and is) really strict on me, especially in comparison to my little brother. When I was my brother's age, I was in bed at 9 pm EXACTLY every night. He technically has a 9 - 9.30 pm bedtime, and my mum really tries to enforce it, but my dad either completely forgets about it or tells my mum to shut up when she asks him to get my bro to bed, usually because he's busy watching TV or youtube with him.

I hate the way my dad treats my mum, and I hate how he is allowing my little brother to become a spoilt brat, with absolutely no responsibilities or rules that he has to follow. 

This anger has been building up for a while, and it was why I did what I did tonight. So, heres what happened.

My mum asked me to go tell my brother to get ready for bed at around 9, so I went downstairs to the office/guest bedroom/ tv room/ whatever to relay that message. Brother and dad are watching what looks like some horribly violent war thingy, loads of bomb sounds and gun noises etc, and I shout over the tv to tell them that bro should get to bed soon. Dad says ok, they'll stop at the end of the scene, so I left them to it. I came back at 9.30, neither of them had moved, so I repeated the instructions, and got screamed at to leave the room because ""it was the most important bit!!!"". I was honestly just so sick of their crap so i just reached in and switched it off and walked away, because my brother has to get to bed on time on a school night, and I had already given them half an hour's warning to pause the bloody thing. 

They both went ballistic, started swearing at me, calling me a stupid cow, a bitch, and the likes, which is the kind of behaviour I can somewhat justify from a 12 year old, but not my 55 year old father. My dad followed me back upstairs, fully screaming at me, calling me abusive, obsessed with being in control, a psychopathic bitch, etc etc. I screamed back, calling him a child, and saying that I wouldnt have to do this kind of shit if he bothered to actually parent his child! He then accuses me of assault, supposedly for turning the tv off, which was interesting.

My dad starts yelling at my mum next, saying that it was her fault for making me relay her messages instead of coming down herself, which isn't fair bc my mum was busy cooking dinner for tomorrow. By this time i'm like fully sobbing, screaming at him to shut up and leave us alone, but he just keeps on yelling so I just ran to my room in tears.

0,"AITA for not wanting to forgive my brother for years of mistreatment? | I (18f) have an older brother (23m) and our relationship is extremely rocky. He dropped out after about a year and a half of JuCo and didn’t tell anyone. Which, while I don’t judge him for dropping out, I have a big issue with him keeping it from everyone.

l have an issue because while he was dropped out and lying, both my parents had surgery. (Summer of 2019). So, most of the housework fell on me. The biggest one was taking care of my other brother (20m) who has autism. All while I was starting my first semester at college (thankfully I still live at home while at uni). It was a tough time. Since my brother was lying about school, he would leave the house early in the morning (6am) and wouldn’t be back till late (9-10pm, when my brother and parents are already asleep).

I was already frustrated with doing everything on my own, but at that point, I didn’t know he was lying. I was more upset that he wasn’t appreciative of me at all, and seemingly didn’t give a shit about my parents, especially my mom, who went through a very invasive and painful surgery. He also was always around the house with an extremely bad attitude, snapping at me, barely even speaking to me and basically treating me like a nuisance, like he was a teenager again.

This treatment and pushing of responsibilities onto me is nothing new. Growing up, when my parents left for a weekend, he would “watch” my brother and I, but he would completely ignore us or talk to us as if we were the most annoying people on the planet. Didn’t do wonders for my self esteem and, once again, I took care of my other brother on my own. The treatment never left.

After he finally came clean about dropping out, he also said he was struggling with depression and didn’t want to tell anyone, because “nobody would understand”. I was upset by this, since both my parents have PTSD, and my mother and I struggle with anxiety and depression. Our family has been through a lot and we’re very open. While I don’t fault him for being scared to talk about these things, I get upset when he acts as though he is the only one struggling, and thus has an excuse to be rude and mean to us. Like he’s using his depression as an excuse to not help around the house and just be a mean person to us.

Recently, he did something stupid and almost lost his girlfriend. I’m not sure, but I guess it flipped a switch in him and he’s been acting way nicer and doing nice things. He actually talks to my brother and I like people and is being honest.

I feel like it’s too late for us. I’ve never felt like he’s loved me as a sister and never treated me with respect. I don’t feel like I need to forgive him. But then I feel guilty because I’m sure his therapist is why he’s turning over a new leaf like this. I feel like if I don't open up, I’ll be stifling his growth.

My cousin decided to marry her boyfriend of 2 years (they were both 21 at the time.) I became good friends with him and continue to be today. He was deployed overseas after being married for almost a year (Army.) Fast-forward nearly another year. He returns from overseas to discover she wants a divorce and on top of that had been cheating on him while he was deployed. They get divorced and she moves in with her parents. A mere few months later she is pregnant by the guy she cheated with. He immediately ditches her and the baby, leaving her to raise it alone.

My cousin and I are very different despite being close as kids. We didn't hang out much but I harbored no ill will until she cheated on her spouse who is a close friend to me. I was upset but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. ""People make mistakes"" I thought.

Fast-forward 18 months. Cousin gives birth to the baby and is living with my grandparents. They are getting on in years and they noticed their memories are not what they used to be (History of Alzheimer's in the family.) They decide to talk to their lawyer to check their affairs are in order because they are unsure how many years of being sound of mind they have left (Keep in mind right now they are still fine.)

Cousin takes grandparents to lawyer’s office. Cousin gets in her head (don't ask because I don't have an answer) that they are going to sign over to her sole power of attorney and management of their finances in preparation of them being unable to make such decisions in the future. The lawyer immediately shoots it down stating the following:

""That is premature as well as a poor choice of guardianship as the grandparents have two perfectly capable sons in their early 50's.""

Giving a 20-something single mom with no job and hardly any work experience that responsibility and power is a bad move.

She gets up on his desk screaming at him he has no right,etc. Lawyer asks her to cease at once or he will call the police. She doesn't. He gets on the phone to dial 911. She explodes out of the room and speeds off, leaving my grandparents stranded. The lawyer apologizes and pays for my grandparents to get a ride home.

Cousin is also best friends with my wife. They would hang out all the time and my wife really enjoys spending time with her little one. For me though, it was the last straw. My grandparents are the sweetest old folks you'd ever meet and she tried to take advantage of them before making a scene like that. I explained to my wife that I understand they are friends but I FORBID cousin to step foot in MY house.

0,"AITA for refusing to split the cost of a housekeeper with my boyfriend? | My (27F) partner (35M) and I both have pretty different standards of living. We have lived together for several years so this is nothing new to us. 

To put it plainly, he would probably sit on camp furniture, eat off of paper plates, and sleep on an air mattress if it weren’t for my presence. This doesn’t bother me. It’s the guy he is and I love him for it. 

I on the other hand like home making and making things “nice”. I have purchased all of our furniture and creature comforts. 

His tolerance threshold for mess is way, way higher than mine. I wouldn’t say he’s a slob but he doesn’t think to do some of the regular chores that need to get done: like vacuuming the baseboards, scrubbing the toilet and cleaning the base, washing the floor, and washing the sheets, cleaning the crumbs off the kitchen counter after you make a sandwich. I think these are pretty typical chores. On a more seasonal rotation I do deeper cleaning, like purging the pantry and deep cleaning the fridge, washing the windows and other textiles around the house, etc. 

Both of us have full time jobs, but he makes 4x what I make. He happens to have a lot of hobbies and spends 100% of the weekend doing just that. He doesn’t make time, or find time, to do household chores so they end up in my hands.

I have asked him several times to share responsibilities with me, but I usually get accused of nagging or he holds it over my head as a giant effort. I should also admit here that his efforts to clean don’t feel very sincere to me (ie: he will swipe the brush around the toilet bowl, but never lift the seat to wipe up the calcified urine build up, a critical task in cleaning the toilet IMO). 

If he doesn’t accuse me of nagging, it’s that “I don’t think my shit stinks”. Or, if I in any way point out the inequities in the time we spend looking after the house, I’m accused of keeping score. 

Today I finally brought up asking him to pay for a housekeeper to come once a month. He insisted it was only fair if we split it. I totally disagree. He makes 4x my salary, and I clean every week. The cost of a cleaner coming once a month would be $100 tops.

He totally thinks I’m TA  for asking for this. 

The alternative to him paying in order to share the responsibility I guess would be me asking him to do chores. Which would lead to a tally and ultimately more resentment, so I don’t see that as a viable option. 

I think he’s being immature and that I’m not asking for a lot.

I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.

The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.

Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

I’m a 24 year old woman, my dad is 65, my fiancé passed away in April, dad was not there for me at all and was even drunk at the funeral, saw me twice after and then ignored me and bailed on every attempt to hang out from me. 

Few months later I start to finally make progress, get my own place all on my own, dad ends up in hospital from mixing alcohol and pills. 

I pay for almost the entire $5k deductible, brother and his wife reluctantly pay $1k cause I literally can’t have more money come out of my account at once. 

Am there in hospital after work every single day despite my very, very unstable mom (they’re divorced but lived together) being there, when he’s out I call out of work and drive 6 hours to get him to the rehab falling asleep driving, drive back, have to go in and get his belongings while dealing with mom who is aggressive saying she’ll call the police on ME when she has no right to be there, have to come back three times to get more of his stuff, same things happen, have multiple breakdowns in car after seeing her. 

Take care of all of his bills, break his lease for him, he calls every day to make sure I’m on top of paying his stuff. Incredibly stressful two months taking care of me and him when I was just able to take care of me, but no one else is helping him. 

He’s out of rehab, brother won’t let him stay with him in 3 bedroom house, I say he can stay with me in my small 800 sqft condo for a couple weeks on the couch, it’s been two months and I can’t have any friends or guys over after 11 (when he gets off work) cause it’s too weird and I think my neighbors think we’re a couple and it’s so fucking weird. 

I stay in my tiny room when he’s here cause there’s no real room in the living room. I’m running out of money that I had saved up but spent on his deductible for rehab. He helped with a couple hundred for rent and says he can’t afford his own place so i say he should find a roommate and he gets offended and says I just want him out of my hair and he does not want a roommate. 

The only reason I’d want him to stay is so he can save money to start paying me back and help with rent since I spent my savings on him but it is so awkward and cramped and uncomfortable. He’s recovered and is sober and it’s good to have a dad and have him back to normal but i feel ive done more than enough when he did nothing for me in the darkest time of my life. Am I the asshole for wanting him out, even though it’d be financially smarter for both of us to live in this small condo together?

0,"AITA for not giving my parents money? | My mother was convicted of a white collar crime years ago and owes the U.S. government a substantial amount of money (neighborhood of $1.3M). She has now owed this money for several years. My parents have property worth around $1.2M-$1.6M. As far as I know, that's all their assets. She does not work (she spent time in prison) and he makes mid/high 5-figures.

&#x200B;

My sister and I are in our late 20s. We both went to college and have not received money from them since we were 18 because of what happened, save for a few hundred here and there. We both have been very successfully professionally (think \~$150k).

&#x200B;

A few years ago, my sister and I received letters that we were named as two of the main beneficiaries on my mom's uncle's estate. When we received the notice, we shared it with our parents. We were honestly not close to our great uncle/communicated with him sparingly during holidays/birthdays. My mother was very close with him growing up, and had continued contact with him. At the time of his death, he knew that my mom was in trouble, but the full extent/amount was not yet figured out.

&#x200B;

My mother now claims that she told my uncle to leave everything to us so that we could help her out. I have no way to verify this and she initially acted surprised, but she has also taken a lie detector test that indicates that she did tell him to leave everything to us so that we could help.

&#x200B;

At the start, we were open with them about what was happening, but their tone in conversations shifted over time, in our opinion, to indicate that they saw themselves more and more entitled to the money. We never came to an agreement on the extent that we would help them, because we were so far off (we gave them very broad assurances like ""we'll help when we can"" as the estate was being worked out, while they made it clear that they thought we were morally obligated to pay the debt outright if we could). By the time that it did close completely \~1 year ago, we already had had several blowup arguments. Our willingness right before the estate closed was probably to give them a monthly stipend but to ask them to sell most of their assets. After it closed, we had a few more VERY serious arguments. As it stands now, I have no immediate plans to help them at all or be in contact with them in any meaningful way (I can go into the reasoning for that specific thing in more detail if needed, but we've had some VERY bad arguments). The proceeds of the estate were in the same ballpark of $1MM EACH for my sister and me.

AWTAs for keeping 100% of what we received, given that there is some truth to the statement that he would have liked some of the money to go to her, and that the lie detector test indicates that she did have some conversation with him, especially with the additional fact that we are both very well off independently?

She has a daughter who I love a lot. And I basically helped raise her since I was 11. But I can’t be a “mom” anymore. My older sister just expects me to take care of her daughter and do every little thing for her. She’s taken advantage of me for so long. And I let her. She’s put me down a lot. For not wearing makeup. For being ten pounds heavier than she is. For not doing enough for her. For not making her food when she wants. For never being enough. For having feelings. But today she drew the line after getting in an argument with me and at one point I called her a bitch. She sent me oodles of essays via text. I apologized for calling her that and for what happened during the fight but then she continued to put me down and blame me for her problems. She kept telling me I wasn’t really “sorry.” I realize I could’ve been better during the argument but she insisted she was the only one who was calm. She was not calm and yelled at me at one point and didn’t let me finish what I was saying. That was the point when I got up and went to my room. 

I did stop talking to her at one point in my life to an extent, but decided to give her another chance to see if she would maybe listen to what I have to say or if she could try and understand that it’s never been easy being her sister. Or trying to talk to her. Talking to her is the most difficult thing I’ve had to do because she doesn’t treat me like a sister. I’m just someone she needs when it’s convenient or someone who is easy to manipulate.

Pretending things never happened is my number one pet peeve and causes my anxiety to be worse. 

Would it really be bad to cut her out of my life other than formalities and interactions with my niece? I know “family is family” but I have friends who feel more like family than she ever has.

My dad got involved with drugs and other illegal activities, and blew their (my parents) entire savings on who knows what. We had nothing. The last vacation we ever took as a family, my dad blew $8,000 in Mexico in a week. Suffice to say I do not trust him with money. He has also been unemployed since I was about 13 or 14 and is on welfare.My mum works at a daycare, but is currently on EI. 

I got my first job at 12, as a paper delivery person, mainly so I could have some money to go to the mall with my friends. The law stated that because I was under 16, my pay cheques had to be made out to my mum, and then she could transfer the money into my account. This would have been fine if it wasn’t for the fact that my dad had access to her checking account, and would drain it on a weekly basis. 

When I was 16, my granddad took me to open my own bank account, at a different bank from my parents. We told my mum, but kept my dad in the dark. He found out when he stole cash from my wallet and saw a new bank card. Since then he would use threats of violence and emotional manipulation tactics to get me to give him my money. I told my mum, but she never did anything. I was 16, what else was I supposed to do? 

I have been consistently employed since then with several different jobs, and despite my best efforts, I’ve never had more than a couple thousand dollars in the bank at a time. I’ve calculated how much my parents have taken from me since I started working, and it’s well over $10,000. 

My parents still regularly ask me for cash, and I keep telling them no. When I do give my them money for say groceries, at best they get chips and ice cream.

Back in 2015 my mother passed from cancer, leaving her home and her assets to ""A"" and I. I had graduated from university but “A” had never attended post-secondary. With no real work experience and a Bachelors degree that was practically useless I dropped my dream of law school and went back to school briefly while working whenever possible to ensure that bills were paid. “A” obtained part-time work. I transferred the all the bills into my name. Eventually, I graduated and obtained a full-time position with benefits and enough income to survive but not much else. ""A"" has a healthy bank account because his inheritance has barely been touched and while he's offered to transfer some bills into his name, no effort has really been made on either of our parts. 

Around 2017 my father came back into my life. We have a good relationship. He wants to see me go to law school but he would like ""A"" and I to keep our current house because housing market. I get it but I’m not particularly attached to living in a house. The maintenance is another of my responsibilities. ""A"" does some household cleaning but nothing when it comes to repairing, doing extensive cleaning, or any other things that need to get done around the house. Further, ""A"" will never be able to afford to buy out my half and I’m uninterested in the house.

It has been several years now since our mother passed and I feel I've done my part in giving “A” opportunities. I've put aside much of my life/interests for years. But life is hitting me hard. I work, I struggle to pay the bills, I drive ""A"" to and from his retail job most days and work overtime as my job requires me to travel frequently all across southern Ontario.

In my spare time, I have been studying for the LSAT which I never wrote prior to 2019.

Our father wants me to attend part-time while continuing to work my full-time job. This would commit me to maintaining the house, the bills, working full-time, doing law school part-time and continuing to give ""A,"" who can't drive, rides to and from work as well as performing any chores requiring driving (groceries, etc.) and graduating later. I think it’s unrealistic. 

Another of my father's arguments is I’ll leave “A” high and dry if we sell the house and split the value 50/50 (roughly $350,000 each). I think it's perfectly fair as, (a) ""A"" is not my kid, (b) I've given ""A"" years to pursue something but he hasn't, and (c) I have to take my own interests into consideration. All of this has been discussed with “A” and my father.

In addition, my paternal grandmother is the Landlord of a small complex in the downtown core which my father runs and he and “M” live. “A” could also come with me.

I feel like the best choice for me is to commit and take law school full-time. I know my father (possibly “A”) will never approve but I think I have to do what is best for me in this case.

I have my own small business, and a part time job. My boyfriend, who I've been seeing for a year, has not worked in that time. When we first started seeing each other, he would ask me for help with a bill or two. I assumed this was one-time help because he was struggling. Within a couple months, I was paying his rent, electric, internet, cell phone, and car insurance, PLUS he expects me to pay when we go out and to help him buy things like video games. I give him my biweekly check from my part-time job entirely. He thinks that I make a lot of money (I don't), because I earn more than he ever has at any of his previous jobs. I've told him multiple times that I don't earn enough to support two people and he needs to find a source of income, but nothing has changed. My own bills are going into default and collections and I can't afford health insurance because I've been paying for his things. I have no savings. I have no credit. This is ruining me financially. But whenever I bring up the prospect of him being responsible for himself financially, it becomes a huge thing - screaming, crying, telling me I NEED to help him, etc. He recently found a job working part time at a local fast food restaurant, but for some reason the training he was supposed to start this weekend never materialized. I'm not sure if he blew it off, or if it really will happen soon.

&#x200B;

The reason he's not working is he has a physical disability (he needs reconstructive surgery on one of his knees due to a car accident a few years ago) and several mental health diagnoses, including Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD. I've suggested he apply for social security, but he says it will take too long to start getting money through them (however, if he had applied a year ago he'd probably be getting a check now). I've suggested he apply for fuel assistance and cash assistance and any number of other benefits, but he never follows through and tells me he can't do these things without my help. The only source of income he has is a little over $100 in food stamps. He asks me to supplement his food budget, and also to do things like pick him up fast food and order him pizza.

Since then, I have driven all the time with one exception. When I found out I was selected for promotion, he insisted we go out and I could pick the place. I was just planning a chill night in as it was Tuesday, but he talked me down. When we got to the parking lot, he said, because I chose the place, I should drive, which sounded fair. Next week, we go to a place of his choosing, and I end up driving because he ""left his keys."" I brought up the trend a week later saying it was causing me not to want to go out with him. He said that because he drives a truck, a 50/50 split isn't beneficial for him but agreed to a driving one out of every three times. I agreed but stated that because I've already given him numerous rides (we went out to lunch numerous times at work where always was the one driving), that we should do 50/50 for October. He agrees.

Yesterday, I stopped avoiding him and we were leaving around the same time and he recommends a carpool. I say yes, again expecting him to drive but I again end up driving. Last night, we were both planning to go to this new bar with a buddy and he suggests a carpool again. I put my foot down and tell him, only if he's driving. He insists on me driving because he doesn't know the place but I say neither do I. He says my car will blend in more and nobody will mess with as opposed to his truck.

0,"WIBTA if I put my dad on blast on social media because he is trying to profit from my little brother's death? | ***Edit to follow rules, sorry for duplicate. 

My brother died about two weeks ago.

My parents are divorced and most of my siblings don't really talk to my dad because of some shitty things he did to my mom and also because he was generally a bad parent. I was a senior in high school when they divorced so I didn't really get caught up in the custody battle, but my little brother chose to live with my mom full time as soon as he could (14 here). 

Fast forward to now, my brother was in his early 20's and tragically died two weeks ago. We held his memorial this week and due to current world conditions had to severely limit the size of the gathering. Additionally, because he explicitly requested it, we had him cremated. My mom and I covered the costs, and the memorial went as well as it could given world and family circumstances, in addition to the tragic nature of his death. 

I found out the day before the memorial that my dad started a GoFundMe to cover the costs of the memorial, and today found out that he also started a donation checking account and is asking his side of the family, his church, his coworkers, and my brother's coworkers to donate in order to help cover the costs of the memorial (which again, my mom and I already paid for and he said he could not afford to help with). 

This is a tragic time and I really don't want to start shit or cause contention, but honestly this makes me completely sick to my stomach because he has already raised several thousand dollars (about 3x the actual costs) and I think he is trying to profit off my brother's death. Additionally, the people who are generously donating are doing so under the assumption that their money goes toward helping with funeral costs, not directly into my dad's pockets. 

Trying to see my dad's side, I know he is in bad shape financially as he does not make much money in general, has debt, and is laid off for the time being. I'm sure he could use the money. He is also grieving, and expressed a lot of regret about our childhoods at the memorial. He may be planning to spend the money on some sort of memorial object, but we already bought him a nice urn amd gave him a portion of the ashes and there is no grave for a grave stone, so I am not sure what that would be. 

I still think he is acting completely unethically and potentially defrauding people. Would I be the asshole if I posted on social media asking him what he is raising money for and letting people know that the costs have already been covered and there is no need for donations? Instead, if people feel compelled to donate, they should donate to a charity or something.

0,"UPDATE: AITA for not wanting a relationship with my parents now they've cut me off? | Recap on [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g06g8u/aita_for_not_wanting_a_relationship_with_my/):  My parents cut me off financially with 10 days notice and BS reasoning. They had offered to pay my rent throughout university so I had 10 days to find a new place to live. I ended up sleeping on my friend's sofa. About 6 weeks of no contact later, they called me asking why I hadn't called to wish my mum a happy birthday. I wanted to know if I was TA for not wanting anything to do with them given the way they cut me off. It later came out that the reason they cut me off is that my older brothers told them I'm a lesbian (which... I might be. Still figuring that out. But my brothers didn't know that). I sent my parents proof my brothers lied and they apologised but I've not forgiven them and probably won't ever. I'd applied for emergency housing and a full student finance loan but as I couldn't prove my parents cut me off the services I had to go through said they couldn't help me. I was also looking into a work placement as my course offers them and they pay a decent amount.

So here's how everything has shaped up:

* I won't be getting emergency housing from uni. I've not heard anything and there's less than a month left before summer, so I'd be shocked if I got it at this stage.
* I'm still living with my friend. She got me a job at her workplace but refuses to take any rent off me so I've been repaying her by sneakily buying food and cooking her dinner as I get home before her. We have plans to move in together this summer ready for next year.
* My parents have done a complete 180 and now want me to forgive them so badly that they're still refusing to sign a letter showing they've cut me off, so I'm still fucked with student finance. My parents have also offered me my truck back, so me, my roommate, and 2 more friends will be going to my parents' house some time soon to collect my truck and some things from my room. My tutor has written a letter for me for student finance which they might accept but I'm waiting to hear back.
* My course changes were approved so now I'm doing what I want, not what my parents want, and it looks like I got my work placement, so I'll be either working and studying part time for 2 years or working all next year and finishing studies the year after. Either way I'll be adding an extra year to my course but I get paid and get relevant experience in my field.

But its the principle of the matter. It’s rude. Plain & simple.” She said “We’re family. I didn’t think you’d care about money like that lmao” we went back & forth & the whole time she was being condescending, saying “do u want ur 74 cents or something? U need 74 cents?” I got mad & said “Don’t ever talk to me again. Bye” she replied “ok, that hurt” & we haven’t spoke since. Few weeks later my cousins get me in a room & tell me she told them what happened & I need to apologize or I’m no longer invited to family vacays. I said if she wants to tell me something, tell me. Don’t get other people to do it for her. So AITA? What should I do? I’m seriously tired of the high & mighty attitude she has towards the younger kids.

0,"AITA for setting boundaries with my boyfriend’s family? | I (27F) have been with my boyfriend Josh (29M) for 2.5 years. I spend ~3 nights/week at his place, and we’re planning for me to officially move in in the next 6 months. The crux of the problem is, he lives in an apartment that his parents bought for him and his younger brother. His brother, Sam, doesn’t live in the same city anymore, so Josh pays his parents slightly below-market rent for the entire place. Since deciding that I should move in, we’ve been trying to get Sam to pick up his stuff from back when they lived together.

The thing is, even though Josh pays rent for the apartment, his parents still see it as “their place,” and his mom in particular will come unannounced and stay for long periods. Most recently, she came to the US for 7 months, alternating between staying with Josh or Sam. There was no end date set when she arrived, and she only left because of immigration requirements. She doesn’t approve of me living with Josh, is cold and snarky to me, and is also quite picky about her living environment, so I stay over less when she visits. She also expects Josh to spend every free moment with her, so we rarely get alone time when she’s here.

As she was leaving at the end of the 7 months, she mentioned she was planning on being back right after New Years! I don’t think I did a great job of containing my shock, and honestly the knowledge that she’d be back so soon was my breaking point. That night, Josh and I had a long discussion about setting boundaries with his mother. I told Josh that her behavior is making me reconsider our relationship, especially as our relationship gets more serious (I shudder to imagine what she’d be like with future kids).

So Josh talked to his mom, and the phone call was apparently a shit show. The highlights are:
- Josh told his mom that, for future visits, she needs to give us set dates in advance. No more unannounced, indefinite stays. His mom responded that it’s her place and she can stay there when she likes. Josh then said that, if that’s the case, we’ll find a new place to move into together. His mom was also offended by this suggestion.
- His mom was angry that we asked Sam to pick up his stuff. In her opinion, they bought the apartment for Josh and Sam, so Sam has a rightful claim over part of it, and we can’t ask him to move his stuff or get rid of it if he refuses.
- She also expressed concern that, if Josh and I eventually marry, I’ll treat her poorly. She was offended at my reaction when she told us when she’d be back, and called me manipulative for saying I was reconsidering our relationship because of her.

I was having dinner with my college roommate and her family, who are from the same country as my boyfriend, and they think my boyfriend’s mom is not the asshole. Some even think I’m being an asshole and should be more receptive to her visits and make more of an effort to endear myself to her.

0,"WIBTA if I left my job of 7 years over a coworker's unaddressed behaviour | Sorry - it's a long one. 

TL;DR: My coworker is driving me nuts. She's slow, throws tantrums, lies, and won't listen to me (manager). Boss won't do anything and I have a new job offer. WIBTA if I left (with appropriate notice), and told my boss that she's the main reason I quit?   

Long version:

About 4 years ago we hired Joan. Joan and I went to the same school, and took the exact same program with the same teachers. 

At first, she was a bit forgetful or asked basic questions, but there's always a learning curve starting a new job. After a year she continued to mess up. Customers would get angry or flat out say they were not coming back because of things she did.  

Now, I give her advice or instructions and she will give me 101 reasons why she wants to do it her way. I try to help her with problems she's having, using advice that she normally would have done herself, but she will reject my idea, seemingly because I was the one who said it. 

Recently, she's had tantrums, screaming matches with the boss and myself, and will cry and storm off over really small disagreements. She NEVER apologises for her behaviour. The one time I pushed for an apology she literally got on her knees and mocked me (""PLEeEeASE forgive me, deadleaf28!"") 

Last week, we made a plan that I would continue hole punching some books while she printed her business cards, and when there was a decent amount to coil, she would start coiling. I guess she forgot? Because when I reminded her about it, she blew a gasket. Convo below: 

Me: Hey, I'll take over the punching now, you can go do your cards.

J: No I'm fine.

Me: But.. I thought I was going to punch and you do your cards? 

J: FINE! I'LL DO THE DAMN CARDS! I WILL DO THEM! I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP YOU!! \*runs away\*

Me: What? 

I met her at her desk and she was really angry and crying. (No actual tears...)

Me: What's wrong, why are you crying? I thought that was the plan, for me to punch and you do cards, then coil?? 

J: IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THE STUPID CARDS I'LL DO THEM!

Boss shows up to see what all the fuss is about. Joan IMMEDIATELY calms down, stops 'crying' and says, ""oh, I misunderstood."" 

I feel like Joan is trying to manipulate me into either quitting or losing my cool. The only time I've raised my voice at her was when she was already yelling at me so I could make my point before she ran away. I've told my boss about my concerns and how I really can't work like this anymore. She says she'll hire somebody new but it's been over a year and she's done a few interviews and hasn't hired anybody, and hasn't told Joan that it's not acceptable behaviour. Recently I got a job offer in the same field, with better pay and a better organization.

0,"AITA for quitting and walking out of my camp counselor job last summer? | I am 17f and I had a job as a camp counselor last summer. It was horrible.

The pay was hourly but we all worked way more hours than we are allowed to report on our time sheets. Minors are only allowed to work 48 hours a week but there is really no time off at camp. The day starts at 7 am and ends at 10 pm. Not to mention if kids wake up in the middle of the night, or pee their beds, then more time. So 15 hour workdays, 7 days a week. 105 hours a week. We're only allowed to report 48 a week, which means only getting paid for 48 a week. 

There is no cell service or access to landlines for us, no internet access, no transportation except cars on or off the camp which is deep in the woods. None of us 16 or 17 year olds had cars. I feel like more people would quit on the spot if they had a way to leave. 

So, onto the drama. Two months into the summer, the camp was having a staffing problem. They'd fired one guy. That guy's three best friends quit on the spot with him. Two international counselors quit soon after. 

I was working at the arts and crafts shed, along with Tom who's 17. We're good friends and I kinda have a crush on him.

One of the girls in our group was the camp owner's daughter, who is really really spoiled, she's used to getting everything she wants if she says ""but Susan's my mom!""

She wanted more craft supplies, and I said no, every child only gets three because we need enough for everyone. She started a screaming crying fit going ""But I want them! My mom's Susan, you have to give me them! you have to!"" It was silly but it was my last straw, and I was like ""Actually I don't have to do anything."" She goes ""Yes you have to, Susan's your boss""

And I go ""Not anymore."" I went to leave and Tom followed me, he said he was done here too. We ran into another counselor with a radio on the path and said they should radio the office to send someone else to the crafts shed, we were quitting.

We packed our duffles and walked away, it took us almost four hours to walk the dirt road out of camp and to the nearest small town, where we went into the dollar store and asked to use a phone because we had no cell reception. His parents were only two hours away so they came to get us that night.

Things apparently got crazy behind us. The counselor we'd told about quitting didn't know who we were so nobody knew who had quit for a while. The camp director was furious at us for having left the children alone, but also furious that we, two minors, had walked off with no ride and no communication with parents. I guess we were in a weird place where we were employed and responsible for children while also legally being children they were responsible for...

I’m not vegan, my son isn’t vegan, and nor is my grandma. However, my cousin who had dropped her kids off at my grandmas IS vegan, and so are her 3 kids, 13,12, and 5. 

My cousin usually drops her kids off at my Grams place so she can go to yoga, and normally (I think from what my grandma has mentioned) she’ll leave cash so my grandma can order them some vegan food. However today she didn’t leave any money because I’m assuming she saw me there and figured I’d take care of the bill. She’s always done stuff like that since we were young, because I have always been a saver and she’s never missed trying to take advantage of that. 

After maybe 2 hours, I decide it’s time for lunch and so ask my grams if she’s hungry cuz I’m happy to cook. She insisted I leave the cooking and order in but I’m not letting an old lady cook or waste money when there’s food in the house so I make some awesome vegan tacos (it was vegan ground beef on lettuce leaves with diced onion and sriracha mayo so really nothing fancy but pretty tasty). 

My kid ate it yelling ‘daddy this is AWESOME’, my grandma ate it and was pleasantly surprised that it was good, I ate it and even the dog was sniffing around at the ground meat. Two of her kids however sat there with their noses turned right the way up and kept saying ‘ew, I just want to order something in’ whilst the youngest chomped it down shaking his butt doing the little kid happy food dance. 

I just told the older two they could eat this or go get fruit from the kitchen. They sat there scowling until their mom came back. When she did they went running to her and told her how hungry they were, at which point she asked why I hadn’t ordered them food when ‘there’s just literally a vegan sushi bar a block away’  I told my cousin that I had cooked vegan food, and I didn’t feel the need to order in when there was already food available. 

She called me a complete asshole (in front of my son as he had wondered in by this point) and told me that if I was such a tightwad she would have squared the cash with me right from the start so her kids didn’t need to go hungry. I was beyond fuming but kept calm for the sake of my son, and instead just went out in the backyard so I could focus on my boy. 

After she left and I came back inside, my grandma was very quiet and asked me to please apologize to my cousin.

0,"AITA for refusing to do Thanksgiving with my boyfriend’s family every other year, even though I previously agreed to? | I am generally all about sticking to your word, but this one has me in a corner. Early on in our relationship, my boyfriend and I agreed that since we wanted to spend holidays together, we’d alternate each year between his parents and my parents for Thanksgiving. Both of our sets of parents live within 30 min of us. The first couple years, it went well. Then, out of the blue, his parents told us one year that we would be going to have dinner with their extended family. Cool. Except his extended family lives a 5 hour drive away and they want us all to drive up there and back together. And we would be staying all weekend, Thurs-Sun.

It was a lot, but it was his year so I agreed. It was mostly great, but his extended family lives in the boonies with no internet access or cell reception. I got back Sunday night to a bunch of angry emails from my boss. I work in a demanding field where the expectation is you pretty much be available 24/7 unless you tell people (and even then it’s frowned upon). I explained that I hadn’t realized I wouldn’t have any access, accepted the reprimand, and moved on.

The problem is, for some reason, his parents now insist on doing this every year. According to my boyfriend they have always hosted thanksgiving at their house, but now they’ve decided his extended family will host every year.   So every other year, I am expected to take the car ride over with the family and spend the whole weekend there. I’ve done it twice and it’s always pretty inconvenient.

It’s his year again, but I’ve found out that I have been invited to go to a work conference shortly after thanksgiving this year. Because of prep, timing, and travel arrangements, I’ll need to fly out the night after thanksgiving. I told my boyfriend and offered to still come up there, but leave early by myself. He got upset. Apparently his family will find this incredibly rude.

This led to a fight where I finally said that I don’t want to go to his extended family every other year. He argued that I’d agreed to it and it was only fair, but I feel that this is way more than I agreed to and is unreasonable. We spend half a day with my family on my years and only have to travel an hour round trip. We spend 4 days with his family and travel 10 hours round trip to somewhere that’s so isolated, I can’t even respond to a work emergency, which makes me look bad.

I told him I wasn’t willing to do it anymore if his parents insist on going to extended family’s. At most, I’d be willing to do it every third year, and do the other two years with my family. He thinks this is incredibly unfair, since I previously agreed to split evenly and since it means his parents have to either choose to host every other year (and not go see extended family) or only see him on Thanksgiving every third year.

I'm female, married, and a vet. went back school using my education benefits/student loans and I'm almost done with my Master's. My husband makes $10 working full time as a temp in a factory. We've been together for a decade and married for about four years. He knew that there was a strong likelihood that we would have to move after my degree program. Now that we're approaching that point, apparently I'm now restricted from going certain places because we have to be in a state that isn't too restrictive on guns, because that would be taking away his freedom. That leaves me with pretty much the deep South, the rustbelt, and a scattered array of other states where I'm probably not gonna be able to make a living. Most of the jobs that pay a living wage in my field are in big metro areas, VA, DC, and so on. Again, this was discussed. I also brought up the possibility of moving abroad, but apparently that made him super angry because he stormed off and accused me of being inconsiderate.

It's not like I'm trying to move somewhere where we can't have them.

I was going broke paying his half of the bills while going to school, and I couldn't take any more hours at work without failing because of my schedule), and that was on top of him need health insurance (I have the VA... I didn't need it. I'm basically having to pay for both of us to have insurance so he can even qualify for it). I would like to 
at least pay off those student loans so we don't have to spend our lives in poverty. I'm not asking him to do it. I'm not even asking for help. I'm asking to be able to get a job that allows me to do so. It would be one thing if he had a degree, or knew a trade, or something... Anything, really... But he doesn't. He hates his job, doesn't want to go to school. He has no aspirations to do anything at all that actually involves any more planning than what he's doing now.

0,"WIBTA if I told my SO to cut back on complaining about being bald? (31F, 31M) | Together 2 yrs. He went bald in his teens, completely bald by age 19 or 20. No medical condition, just very early onset male pattern baldness. I am hugely sympathetic – your hair is a big part of how you look, and I can’t imagine how hard that’d be as a teen. Not diminishing the importance or what a big deal that is to guys, especially so young. I get it. 

He is going to interview for medical residency soon and all he can talk about is how no one is going to hire him because he’s bald. He’s 6’2”, slim and athletic (swimmer/runner body), Caucasian, very handsome and symmetrical face, perfect teeth. Some people don’t like the bald look, but everything else is conventionally perfect. And he’s very sociable, intelligent, great with kids (looking for pediatric-related residency, so that’s relevant), has good grades, etc.

He goes on and on about how being bald is going to hold him back, nobody’s going to hire him, he should’ve gone to school for a job where you don’t interact with the public so employers might still hire him and just keep him in the background where nobody has to see him. In short, he’s being ridiculous, but he actually says this stuff very seriously, every single day.

I, on the other hand, am a very petite (4’11”, 95 lb), very young-looking (I was carded for an R-rated movie last year), dark-skinned black woman, also a doctor.  I started a little younger than he did, so I’m almost done with my surgery-related residency. It’s a constant struggle for me to be taken seriously as a surgeon. I am ALWAYS confused for a secretary or medical assistant (at best, a nurse) even when I’m in my surgical scrubs. This includes patients, staff, and other doctors. Patients don’t trust my advice, staff don’t take my instructions as seriously, colleagues aren’t always welcoming. That’s its own story, suffices to say I have a hard time and probably always will.

I just deal with it (what choice do I have?) but it’s really bothering me lately how much my SO whines about being bald when he otherwise has THE most stereotypical “doctor look” ever. I honestly want to tell him that I’m not the right person to complain to about that, considering how much harder I objectively have it, and that he needs to grow up. It just makes me roll my eyes being a dark-skinned black woman who looks like a third-grader, comforting this tall, thin, athletic, handsome white man about how he’s such a poor victim of genetics and will never be accepted into medicine because he has no hair, and reassuring him that he isn’t too “weird looking” to get a residency.

0,"AITA for refusing to claim my grandma? | Some backstory: My grandmother and I have never had a very good relationship. My cousins and I have a running ""joke"" that grandma loves you... Until you turn 13. Then she absolutely hates you until you prove yourself. My oldest cousin got married to a wonderful guy. My middle cousin gave grandma her first great grandbaby. When I started going to college, grandma started liking me again, but that seemed to end quickly when she found out I medically withdrew.

Because I never ""earned grandma's love,"" she's always been really petty and nasty towards me, especially around the holidays. Most notable is the Christmas my brother was born. My parents were still in the hospital on Christmas Eve, so I was alone with my grandparents. My grandmother screamed at me that I was an ungrateful child, my parents give me everything and I squander it, and I'm horribly disrespectful and don't deserve what they give me. I didn't tell my parents for years. It got worse, but I always took it because my brother loved having the family together for Christmas.

Three Christmases ago, grandma started acting nasty towards my little brother. Even to the point that she made him cry on his birthday because she accidentally caused him to spill his milkshake but ended up screaming at him that he was acting ridiculous and that it was all his fault and he didn't deserve the milkshake in the first place. That's when my hatred really began to fester.

Two Christmases ago, I was late to Christmas because of work. Before I got there, my grandma kept needling my dad over petty shit and my dad got mad, which turned into an argument that he ended with, ""This is my house and you need to respect that.""

I show up early Christmas morning to find my parents standing in the kitchen. Grandma left in the middle of the night to check into a hotel and left a note to my little brother blaming my dad for acting immature and attacking her.

Grandpa was gone to check on her. He comes back and goes to talk to my parents privately. My mom tells me that grandpa was sent to tell my dad that she refuses to come back for Christmas unless he apologizes for unjustifiably attacking her and acknowledges that he's ruining Christmas. If dad refused, then grandpa was to pack up their things and leave. My grandma also demanded my grandpa take my uncle's ashes from off our mantel because we ""don't deserve to have him in \[our\] house anymore."" (I was very close to my uncle before he passed.)

Since then, grandma keeps sending gifts to my little brother, saying she is innocent and it's all my dad's fault. My parents haven't let him see any of it (too hard to explain). Grandma has made no attempt to contact to me.

My oldest cousin told me that I'm overreacting and I ""just need to get over it."" My friends have looked at me shocked when I say that it would be easier if she was dead, because that's a better explanation than what's gone on.

At the time I started getting close to someone i saw as a sister, let's call her Emy. She lives in the uni hostels and I rented a studio apt next to uni but because we spent all our time together she just moved in with me. She paid for nothing (no rent, bills, expenses) I didnt mind because it wasnt a big deal. As I said things were cheap.
My boyfriend, his friends and my friends would hangout at my place most of the time. One specific friend we'll call him Jack started a thing with Emy which led to her having feelings for him.
Emy was in a different faculty and had her own schedule so she couldnt spend time with us most of the time. Because of how often they came I started to get to know the type of person Jack is. In summary hes a playboy.
I tried warning Emy about Jack and she said that I was overreacting and that it's fine for him to see other people because ""they're not official yet"", but she was very protective of him.
Whenever we'd go out (without Emy) theres always a new girl with jack and everytime I was the one paying for everything. For the first few times i was trying to be nice but then it became a habit. I always end up pay for 4 people (me, my boyfriend, jack and any new girl he'd bring) and if they invited more friends id pay for them too. This took a toll on my finances where I couldn't afford necessities.

I knew my boyfriend was coming over with Jack which means he'd try to eat whatever I have left so when cooking I added some things I knew he was allergic to.

We went through a really rough patch about a year ago, mostly due to issues on my end. However, she told me she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. She told me she would only keep it if I was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, I said I was fully committed, and we kept the baby.

As time went on, I became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was mine. I did the math and thought it was unlikely it was mine, on top of having a gut feeling. I was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, I could barely even hold him because I was so convinced he wasn't mine.

I told my wife I wanted a paternity test. She was upset but told me to get one if it would ease my mind. The test comes back two weeks later and it says I am not the father.

I'm absolutely livid. I had an out of body experience. I stormed into our house and just let loose. I felt like I couldn't stop myself, I was completely broken in that moment. I cried and screamed and asked her what I did to deserve this. I absolutely never laid a hand on her.

The whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. This made me even angrier for some reason, so I kicked her out right then and there. Told her to pack her bags and just get out.

She calls me the next day and tells me that I deserve to know that the baby is mine, and asks me to get a paternity test from another company. I figure I have nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help me in a divorce, so we get one at the company she suggested, and I sent a third to another company, just to be sure.

I get the results from one and they say I am the baby's father. I wait a few days and don't say anything, then get the second set of results, also confirming I'm the father. I feel like the weight of the world has just been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally be the dad I want to be.

I call my wife to give her the good news and she tells me she's not moving back in. She says she's disgusted with how I acted by asking for a paternity test and my reaction to the false one. She tells me I can come see my son, but she will be filing for divorce.

But inertia is incredibly powerful, especially if you're already exhausted from working from 8am - 11pm every day. We've had a lot of discussions where I try to talk her into actually setting aside some time to network and apply at other places, but she never gets around to it. For context it has been **1.5 years** since she started complaining about her job and she hadn't even applied to other places. In fact we talked about it briefly on our first date.

&#x200B;

Her boss is intelligent & manipulative. He will occasionally throw her a bone, like give her a tiny raise, or compliment her work, that makes her feel like ""maybe things will get better"" - but they don't, and she's always in tears about it a few days later. She also has some sort of internal confidence issue, combined with inertia, combined with not having the energy / motivation to do it.

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to do - it's not like I can apply for her. But it was breaking my heart to see her like this. So one day I asked her to cover her eyes because I had a surprise for her. I led her into the bedroom where I had put her laptop and then shut the door behind her, and held it shut. I told her through the doors that I would not be letting her out until she showed me a few submitted applications. I even left some water and food in the room.

&#x200B;

She whined a bit at first and asked me to let her out but I refused. It felt cruel but necessary to finally give her a push. Honestly I have done a lot of talking with her, and I feel talking is just that - talk. She eventually caved and started editing her resume and writing the cover letter. After 2.5 hours she had sent a few applications out and I let her out, and we hugged it out.

1,"AITA for not punishing my daughter for standing up to her cousin? | Hi all. 

My sister Eleanor and her husband Paul were staying over at our place for my much younger brother's wedding over the weekend.

Eleanor and me have daughters who are both 15. My daughter is called Sarah and hers is Becky. They are both very pretty but are polar opposites in terms of personality. Becky is very confident, outgoing, has loads of friends and is a huge party girl. She's also very capable academically and according to Eleanor is top or near the top of most of her classes. Sarah is the opposite. She is a kind and gentle person but is sensitive and at times awkward, with major issues with her confidence. She has a few very close friends rather than being part of a large group. Her academic performance is decent but not exceptional like Becky, but we are nevertheless proud of her because we know she works hard at school. 

Becky bullies Sarah and has done for a long time. She is spoiled by her parents who think that it's ''just harmless kid stuff''. Just this weekend she told Sarah that she was too ugly to go the wedding and that she would have to stay out of the photos. She also tried to push her out of big family photo at the reception. My wife Diane had to find Sarah after she ran outside crying. This bullying has gone on for years and nobody has made an attempt to stop it. 

Sunday morning in the garden we heard someone scream inside the house. We ran into the kitchen to find Becky feeling around the kitchens trying to find her glasses. She has very bad eyesight, bad enough that according Eleanor she needs to feel around for her glasses on her bedside table since everything is a blur for her. She has worn glasses in a high prescription since she was a baby. 
Becky was crying her eyes out until Diane found her glasses in one of the food cupboards. Once she had got them back on she started saying that Sarah took her glasses. 

I called Sarah downstairs and she admitted that she did take the glasses. We were all disappointed but Eleanor and Paul proceeded to tear into her about how cruel and nasty she was and how frightened and upset Becky was because of her. 

Sarah tried to explain that Becky had been taunting her about the photos and had been saying that she would be cropped out, but Becky's parents had no sympathy and said that maybe a ''bully'' like Sarah deserves that. I went ballistic and said that Becky had been bullying Sarah for years and they have laughed it off. Paul tried to say that Becky's ''girly teasing'' wasn't bullying and that what Sarah did was. 

I can see why Eleanor wants Sarah punished, but at the same time her daughter was the instigator and I don't agree with her wanting to punish our daughter after hers inflicted years of psychological abuse on her. We don't want to punishing Sarah. Obviously it was wrong to take the glasses, but it was a response to years of torment.

1,"AITA for getting mad at my friend for not moving in when I'm abroad? | A year ago I decided that I wanted to spend the 5th semester of my bachelor's degree in London. I am leaving for London in 9 days. I have a rather big apartment back home where I already have 2 roommates. I've always known that when I leave for London I would have to find a third resident. 6 months ago my very close friend came to me, and asked very politely if he could move in when I leave. The two other roommates were not my friends prior to moving in so they don't know the actual rent. They pay a rather low rent for the average rent in the area but they actually pay 80% of the rent where I pay the remaining 20%. I pay for everything else in the apartment and it is my apartment on paper too. I figured I was gonna get a third roommate who would pay the same amount as the other two, so I would have more money for London.

My friend however knows how much I pay, and he asked if he could move in and pay the 20%. Both he and I have always been bad with saving up money and I knew he really needed a lower rent so I agreed on a few conditions. I wanted him to take over the room with my furniture so I didn't have too pay for them to be stored. He agreed. I also didn't want to stress about the move because that was the last thing I needed. He knew I was doing him a favor so he went along.

I have been rather stressed and in a terrible mental condition ever since and just really need to leave for London for a fresh start. He knows this. We both smoke way too much weed, and I want to get away from that. A month ago he got a new job that pays a lot better. Now he wants to stay at his current apartment and not move in at my place. At first I was furious. He came to me because he needed my help and now he doesn't want it. I calmed down and told him that I would still like to continue with our deal because it really suits me. He would still pay a very very low rent, live in a better area and in a bigger apartment. He told me he would move in if I didn't find anyone else. I never looked for anyone else as I was very comfortable with our agreement. He has now told me he won't move in and I am very pissed but am trying to avoid confrontation.

He is a very stubborn person who always struggles to see other perspectives but I don't know if I am letting my stress make a not so difficult situation more difficult than neccessary.

Was I the asshole or was I set up to be the asshole? | So much background here and 3000 characters is never going to cut it so if you read please trust me that I'm trying to do my best to narrate this reliably. I am 28, first real job as VP of sales in a smallish manufacturing company. There are two other VPs but I have the most issues with the VP of manufacturing (Ben) who I feel always steps on my toes (this is very important) and is super jealous that he's 65 and just got the job and I'm a woman and am at his level. 

Last week boss was out of town so security company were sending me notifications. One night company called and alarm was going off. I drove in and was met by our security company. Only one at work was bosses son who had his beats on and didn't hear anything. No obvious damage and nothing seemed missing so I went home. But next morning about 20k in samples were missing. Police came, could find no evidence of break and interviewed everyone and the detective told me he was 99% certain that the son walked out with the samples and asked if I wanted to have him arrested. Being the boss's son I tried to call my boss and he asked what the samples were, he said they were an old unit and he'd deal with it when he got back. I said ok. 

Here's where I made the huge mistake, I asked Ben for his advice on Friday. He told me strait up ""you need to accuse (son) in the staff meeting on Wednesday. If the detective said he did it, boss needs to know."" I have literally been sleepless ever since knowing what I should do. 

So meeting came and boss wanted to talk about the ""break in."" I spoke up and said that I was really sorry but all the evidence points to your son stealing the samples. At that moment Ben spoke up and said essentially ""oh hey about that, I forgot to tell you guys that I accidentally set off the alarm that night and I have the samples for my trip this week."" I wanted to die. Ben absolutely set me up to look bad in this. I am shocked at how petty a 65 year old man can be. Like blown away in my shoes. My boss looked at me and told me directly ""well you're fired, you can clean out your stuff and get out of my business."" I started crying uncontrollably and went to my office to leave.

1,"AITA for not paying the bill at a restaurant and not tipping? | This happened a few years ago, but since right now I have nothing to do,I can’t stop thinking about it. 

A friend of mine wanted to go to a restaurant for his birthday and asked toto RSVP so that he could reserve a table. The restaurant hadn’t been open very long, but it already had a built in audience since it was part of a franchise. About 25 people answered. 

I am always the one that’s on time, which is early for everyone else, and that day was no exception. No one was there, not even my friend, but still, I told the hostess that I was part of the group, and she told me that they already had the table waiting, but I must wait for my friend. That was fine, he got there 10mins later. He approached the hostess to ask her to take us to the table, and she refused. She said that she could only sit ya if there was half of the people he had reserved there. We were shocked, we had never heard of such policy before, especially at a franchise spicy chicken wings place, and also we knew that our friends were not going to be there on time. 

We had to wait for an hour and a half on the sitting room. We saw how the place went from mildly busy to packed, and from the sitting room we could see our reserved table and how they never touched it. They just wouldn’t let us go in until half the people were there. 

At the moment I thought that it was because they didn’t want the waiter to get confused on our orders, but turns out that’s what he did later. 

Maybe having only 1 waiter for a 25 people table and have him still wait on his whole section wasn’t a good idea, but he still made a lot of mistakes. If we asked for water he brought Coke and when we tried to send it back, he told us that it was already in the system and he had to charge us for the water in addition since he couldn’t delete the coke. He did this with several items and people had to pay double for food they didn’t order. The bill was astronomically high at the end of the night, and there was food on the table that no one touched because we hadn’t ordered it. We asked to speak with the manager and he said that the waiter was right in how he had handled it, and there was no way to fix his mistakes. 

We only paid for the food we originally ordered and left. 

They tried to chase us down the street, but we were already on our cars and leaving.

1,"AITA for wanting someone to pay me after he lost a bet? | So I work at an office with around 300 others and even though there is some competition between certain people in general the work atmosphere is great. We joke around with eachother, we do group activities  and we take friendly bets.

These bets can be about anything. I bet you can't throw this piece of paper on X's desk from here for $20 or something equally benign. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. When I lose I always make it a point to instantly pay and not whine about it. Fair is fair.

3 weeks ago I made a bet with Jack. He is maybe 10 years younger than me even though he earns the same as me he is one of those guys who manages to spend his whole salary before the end of the month. No problem, we're all adults and can make our own choices. The bet we made was about blackjack. We were talking about casino games and I said did you know that the version of blackjack at a certain casino has a house edge of 0.74% to which he replied that it actually is a lot more. Time for a bet. The usual $20? Let's do it. Shake on it. Lets see who's right.

Boom, I am right. Jack asked me if he could pay later. Sure man, why not. It's only $20. All good.

A week passes by. ""Hey Jack, you still owe me that $20"". ""Yeah man, tomorrow ill get it for you, only have my cards on me now"". Queue a few weeks of excuses and 'Oh sorry I forgot's. Yesterday a group of about 9 colleagues including Jack are sitting in the bar below our our office after work and I see him pay for a $7 organic craft beer with a $20 note. ""Hey Jack, that's my $20!"" in a non confronting tone. He tells me that he doesn't owe me because the terms of the bet were not clear and that he therefor owes me nothing. I get angry and proceed telling him he is a cunt and that if he is a real man he should just bite the bullet and pay me reminding I would have paid him straight away if I would have been wrong.

At this point Becky another colleague, arguably the hottest and most popular of the group, intervenes. ""Let it go, its only $20"". ""No"", I reply. ""Jack is an asshole for not paying me"". A little back and forth ensues and the group turns against me. In the end I tell Jack that he can keep my $20, that he is a little bitch and that I hope he enjoys his beer.

She was getting rid of some of his clothes and told me to take anything I fancied before it went to the charity shop. 

In the box were lots of his clothes but also a box with his military dog tags and watches from when he was in the army, some coins too. I told her and she quickly realised and took the dog tags and coins out as she wanted to keep them. 
There were 3 watched in the box and I asked if I could have the gold watch. She said sure and I took it along with a belt and necklace. 

A few months passed and the watch broke. I took it to a shop to be fixed and the guy said it was super valuable and actually worth over £300+ if fully functional. He checked it out and offered me the £300 there and then. 
I was at a hard point in my life and had car insurance due, rent due and money owed to a credit card and my MOT due. I took him up on the offer and then excitedly rang my girlfriend to tell her. 

At first, she got mad and said I better get it back and that she didn't give it me to sell it. I said that it was being given away anyway and she said that no, the clothes were to be given away but when she realised she had the box of dog tags and watches was in there, she took it out and only gave me that watch because it was me who asked. 

I said that I was sorry for the misunderstanding but that what's done is done and I can't just go and get it back because the guy will sell it for a profit, not just to sell back to me for what he bought it. She asked how much I got, I said £300 and she screamed at me and said it was worth way more than £1,000. I checked this later and in fact it's worth around £800-900. 

She then said if I'd sold it then she wanted at least some of the money. I said I'd already booked my MOT and paid off my credit card. She cried and said I'm an asshole. We spoke the next day and she said she was genuinely reconsidering our relationship.

I’m 36 years old and am married with a child of my own (13 M)and 3 step children (15 F, 14 M, 10F) . All 4 kids live with me and my husband. I have an ex husband who I will start referring to as X. My husband and I married 2 years ago, I have been divorced from X as of 5 years ago. We married at 20 and it just never was really going to work. Honestly surprised we made it 10 years.

We are not poor, but we do not spend frivolously. We have enough money for the life we live and that’s about it. No expensive vacations or anything like that. Now, X I guess came into a lot of money shortly after we divorced. He got a new job or something idk, we don’t talk. X takes our son for 2 weekends a month, and he ALWAYS comes back with something. Videogames and gaming accessories, shoes, sports equipment, clothes, shit even expensive colognes and a chain once. 

My husband and I cannot afford to spend on the kids like this, and the kids understand. They have what they need but ultimately they have to wait til Christmas or birthday if they want something like that. I’ve been seeing tension among the kids, my husbands kids have been getting upset about the constant gifts my son gets from X. My husband thinks it’s a little ridiculous too, like X is just trying to show off, but he’s not going to tell X what he can and can’t get for his own son. 

Since all the sheltering, my son hasn’t seen his father. But last week we got a prime package with X’s name on it. It was a gift for our son. Some game he wanted idk. Before giving it to our son, I decided this was going to stop. I called X and explained that it’s totally unfair to the other kids when they see him with all new things. And that if he wants to buy our son things they have to stay at his place. 

X roared at me “Just because your new husband can’t afford what I can for his own kids, I can’t give my son gifts? I worked hard for my money I can spoil my son if I want to, I don’t have to worry about your step kids feelings. I don’t have to buy my son less because you got remarried”

After that conversation, I really don’t know. X has every right to buy what he wants for HIS son, and my step kids aren’t his problem. But I still feel bad, I know they wonder why he gets all new stuff and they don’t.

It's grueling work. You work 10 hour shifts, and you're walking, stepping on steps, and bending over the hole time. It used to start at minimum wage, but now it starts at 10$. The ***CAP*** income for 99% of workers is 13$ an hour. Basically, it's a bullshit job. 

I still talk with a few people there and they say morale has been really low. There's been a major issue with shipments getting delayed, so they're out of a lot of product. This leads to a problem where you work for about 30 minutes getting the product ready, only to find out you don't have enough and need to undo that work, and re-do the work with a replacement. This is very physical work all done on a tight schedule while preforming other time sensitive, also physical duties. This always happens when it starts snowing up north.

At a thanksgiving-adjacent dinner, Basically-uncle was complaining about his employees. Keeping in mind that I'm adding some context to his words and these aren't direct quotes, his complaints are:

1. too many people ""have to"" be fired because they fail a random drug test. 

2. on the rare chance that there's an issue with a machine, most folk opt to sit down after they've gotten as ahead as they can be without making a mess. He's tired of telling them to find a broom or other busy work to do.

It was a small sized mutt which looked a little like a collie, so we named her Collie. Collie is the 3rd member of our childless household of family pets, we had 1 more dog and a cat.


We had Collie let loose to run around the neighbourhood every evening, and she would come back in about 30 minutes. It wasn't that we won't walk her, she just doesn't do well with a leash and prefers to run around all by herself. Our other dog prefers to be leashed and me or my wife would walk her every other day. 


One day Collie didn't return, it was 11 May 2018(yes I record down the dates). We were devastated and looked for her for weeks. Posters with reward, social media and shelters, we did everything we could. Eventually we gave up and accepted that we may never see Collie again.


Last month, I was visiting a client's house and on the way happened to saw Collie entertaining herself in somebody's yard. I wasn't sure at first, but the similarities were definitely there, so I called out her name and she actually raised her head and responded, that confirmed it. I went knocking on the door and 2 children answered, the adults weren't home.


It turns out that the younger child of the family took Collie from the streets, thinking that she was abandoned. The family took Collie in and never bothered to find her owners(Collie had been microchipped and my contact number was on her collar). 


I told the 2 children that I will be taking Collie and left them my number, telling them to let their parents contact me for the expenses for 2 years, I will pay them. They tried to stop me but I warned them that they have stolen my dog and that stopped them.

When she was 5 her teacher (who has taught for 30+ years) said she's the brightest kid he's ever taught. She has always smashed her targets and always been top of her class. She's doing really well at school. Her teachers all love her and she has lots of friends who she gets along really well with. 

My sister has a son the same age, Tommy. Nice lad who goes to the same school as Anna.

He struggles academically and his grades are often below average. 

The school held assessments recently (not official tests just assessments to see what level everyone is working at). Anna did really well at everything as we expected. Tommy, also, met his targets in his tests too. The targets weren't that high but the targets are personal. Anna got the highest grades across the board. 

Yesterday evening we all went to my sister's place. My parents attended, but they briefly left to do some christmas shopping. Anna and Tommy wanted to go with them which they said yes to. 

When they came back they were both in tears. They were selling giant cuddly toys and they both wanted one. My parents didn't bring too much money and could only buy one and chose Tommy, because they were ''so proud'' that he managed to hit his target grades. Anna spent the return the car journey crying and calling him mean things like dumb and ugly which made him cry too. 

When my parents told me their decision I saw red. So the kid who only just manages to get average grades gets rewarded, and the kid who exceeds all her targets and is the best in her year gets nothing? I was absolutely fuming and had a go at my parents for their bad decision. 

We left early and my husband tried to say that I was overly harsh and that I should consider their point of view. I'm sorry but no. They chose Tommy over Anna even though Anna achieved more.

1,"AITA for making an ""unequal gift"" for my girlfriend on her birthday | So 5 months ago, on my(27m) birthday, my girlfriend(25f) bought me a drone as a birthday present. I was really happy and enjoyed that gift and i've decided to make something special for her. I had 3 months until her birthday. I've started brainstorming all kind of ideas and in the end came to the conclusion: it's not about gift as a material thing, but its about emotions (cpt. obvious).  The thing is that i love all kind of riddles, puzzles, quests, etc and i was trying to make my girlfriend join the dark side. After some time she also have started to enjoy theses kind of activities, especially break rooms. So my idea for her birthday present was to make her cool city quest. In my town, there are a few companies that  organize city quest and they have only a few set quest scenarios. So i've decided to make my own super cool romantic quest. First of all i've searched for an app to make things easier, but i could not find one, so i made my own app for quest creation(putting markers on the map with description to guide my girlfriend through quest). Then i wrote a scenario. In the end quest included places of our first date, first kiss, etc. also i've added a few historical city places, it had to be fun and educational.

Three days ago the day has come. It was her birthday. I've showed her my quest-app and the quest had began. To keep thing short it was really fun, romantic and entertaining; we had a great time. It seemed that she liked it a lot. When we came home, we had a dinner, watched TV and started to prepare to go to the bed. At that moment i've noticed that my girlfriend looks sad.

1,"AITA For falling out with my brother's wife? | Basically this has been going on for a few years now, I haven't spoken to her for some time and my parents said I was probably over reacting and should let it go now . I dated a guy for a year who was my sister in laws best friend. He was super nice at first and then became a leech. He started borrowing hundreds of dollars from me and my niave ass kept loaning it. He eventually owed me over $2000 - honestly, I'd stopped keeping track after a bit because you just don't expect your boyf to take advantage like that. 

It got towards the end of our relationship where I was sending him money for food and he would recieve it and go and sit in a bar with his friends and stop texting me back. I decided to end the relationship due to feeling like this was going to be vicious circle and I had started having feelings for another man who was self sufficient and made time for me. There was no cheating, I ended everything properly and was honest.
He didn't like this and decided this was enough to not pay the money back - said i deserved it. 

He blocked me on everything so I couldn't contact so I asked brothers wife to speak to him please because it isn't fair, i worked hard for my money and he didn't have a job through our entire relationship. She said she didn't want to get involved and got really short with me and said I shouldnt of asked her to contact him and I was putting her in an awkward position.

I said that she was condoning his behaviour and a good friend would called their friends out on their BS and doing so didn't mean getting involved, just reassuring her friend he's pulling a D*** move.  My brother then ended up getting involved and it started a lot of arguments until he finally came back to me and said i was in the wrong for upsetting his wife asking for help and told me it was my own fault for lending money to someone in the hopes of them paying it back. 

I never received the money and brother's wife and ex boyf are still best friends and I haven't spoken to wife, brother or ex in over 2 years now.

1,"AITA for reporting my son’s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he’s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. 

Two weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would “try his best”. 

That afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said “if you’re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.”

After that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. 

I called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would “look into it.” After a couple more days, he hadn’t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that “nobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he’s the best one at the school” (Which I sincerely doubt). 

I mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is “the nicest guy you’ll ever meet“ and that her children say my son is “extremely disruptive” on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn’t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.

1,"AITA for calling up a mom the day before her son's Bar Mitzvah and telling her to invite my daughter? | My daughter is 13 and attends a relatively small middle school with only ~50 kids in her grade. Everyone in the grade knows each other well, and for the most part all the parents know each other too. It just so happens based on the area that the school is in that almost half of the kids in the school are Jewish. So a lot of these kids are having Bar/Bat Mitzvah parties, and so far everyone that had a party has invited the entire grade. 

My daughter is socially awkward and does not really have friends. She's a very sweet kid, but extremely shy and I've heard that it comes off as her thinking she is smarter than other people (I don't see it, but that's what I've heard). A boy had his bar Mitzvah this past Saturday, and the day before I heard that he invited *literally* every kid in the grade except for a notorious bully and my daughter. I was furious and upset. 

I let myself calm down before calling his mother, and she was clearly uncomfortable over the phone and just said that she let her son choose the guest list. I said that I could understand that even if he was inviting 40 out of 50 kids, but to just exclude two is cruel. Especially since my daughter is certainly not a bully. She did seem to feel bad but wasn't making any move to do anything about it. 

So I said ""I'm planning to bring my daughter to the party tomorrow, is that okay?"" She responded that they can't add another person the day before the party. I said that they invited over 200 people (including family, family friends, and non-school friends) and they can fit one more person, especially since at least one person won't show up. She ultimately agreed, and I ended up taking my daughter.

Nobody knows, including my daughter, what I did, so it's not like the kids at school know and I embarrassed her (as long as the other mother didn't tell people). I feel bad for making the ""demand"" the day before the party, but that's when I found out. I knew my daughter would be crushed after the party if she found out everyone else was invited.

1,"AITA for exposing a man as a fake veteran before his wedding? | I'm from New Zealand and i live in Ireland at the moment. One of my friends, Kathy, is Irish and had been dating another kiwi named John. John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. I knew he was a phony from the beginning, since i am a member myself i noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when i met him at a party he told me stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. I have told Kathy and her friends my concerns but they never believed me because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Im guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk. 

I was able to get someone i knew in the service to search up his name and i found that he actually enlisted but was dishonorably discharged within a week of entering for bad conduct. Obviously this means he is not a lieutenant and should not have any uniforms. I get this information within a few weeks before his wedding. There's several legal ways to do this but i don't want to get into it for confidentiality.

  Kathy's brother emailed around 1600 making announcements for the wedding. This allowed me to get everyone's emails. I sent an email explaining all the discrepancies of his uniforms, stories he told, and finally proof submitting his discharge papers. Kathy decided to cancel the wedding and there was massive flame war that occurred, via email. I didn't even know that was possible but it happened. People went on saying how was a scumbag that should've minded my own business. Other people have told me that i should've told Kathy this privately but i feel everyone should've known that this man was a lying piece of shit. Kathy was initially angry but has now thanked me.

I feel like a huge asshole for doing this but I am so sick of being at 5% kidney function and being at dialysis three times a week. I am exhausted and tired of being sick. It sucks, and my wife’s kidney has a high chance of turning things around for me and hopefully I can live normally again.

I had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. 

The date was going ok. It was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so I decided to break the tension. A while ago, I heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order French fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. I've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. 

When the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, ""Does the Guac have onions?"" To which she responded, ""Yes, it does"".  I then proceeded to tell her, ""I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?"" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, ""are you really allergic?"" To which I said ""no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac"". She was pretty impressed like ""damn, I'm stealing this one"". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. 

The rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. 

The first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  

(Side note: I don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don't know why I thought that.) 

Cutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, ""I barely got any onions in the bite"". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. 

After leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  

He kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , ""Okay"". In my head, I thought I'd just let him drop me there and then I'll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I'm like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I'm sure and I'm like yes I'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. 

At the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I'm the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. ""Thank you so much for everything.""

He gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but I don't think I was an asshole because I did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all my fault.

1,"AITA for wanting my husband to pay for my daughter's college tuition? | I married my current husband seven years ago. He has three children from a previous marriage and I have my daughter from a previous one as well. Two of his children are in college right now and one graduated in May, and my daughter is starting high school in August.

I really want my daughter to go to a top tier school as my daughter has stated many times she wants to either go to John Hopkins, Stanford, NYU or Columbia. My stepchildren go to state colleges.

Yesterday, all of us were together for a birthday when I mentioned my daughter, M would start SAT classes. My eldest step son J remarked that he and his sisters B and R never took SAT prep and did just fine. This led me to discuss how M wants to go to a prestigious school that would demand a higher testing scores.

This led B, who for context purposes is always trying to start a fight even on a family occasion, to ask how M would get scholarships to go live somewhere and go to school at private colleges. Their father/my husband refused to allow his children (with agreement with their mother) to send off to private or out of state schools due to the high tuition.

So, it would not be that far fetched that now, with his children locked in their current schools that both of their parents wanted, that my husband and I would send my daughter to a nicer college. My ex-husband have not discussed yet what we would like for M, but my ex husband does have two kids with his new wife. I think my ex-husband would be fine if my husband and I paid for M's college tuition and expenses.

B hitched a fit that it wouldn't be fair for her siblings and herself if M got to go out of state. I told her that paying for three children to go out of state would be a lot of money, but that just paying for one is not as expensive. Also, I reminded them that their own mother agreed that they should stay in state for the lower tuition. B argued that her mother is still unmarried and could not afford the costs, so I had to repeat AGAIN that three children out of state is a heavy burden compared to one.  I also said that her father and I share finances so sending M to SAT prep and other things is my right to do. If my husband had wanted his children to go out of state with our money, I would not have been mad, which I told my stepchildren. It's really a matter to discuss with their own parents; not me. B then called me an ass, to which I told her to not use language like that. 

B told me I was being inconsiderate, so I had my husband ask her to back off and calm down to which she refused. 

B, even though she's an adult, acts very immaturely with her stepsister and always has, ever since we got married. B is eight years older than M but acts younger. I am taking her comments with a grain of salt, but I would like to gain outside opinions on this.

B and her siblings were quiet the rest of the evening, and B was probably trying to stir up more drama as it is. I'm getting tired, frankly, of how she is constantly undermining me in front of everyone when I'm really just trying to better my daughter's life. It's not my fault my husband and his ex-wife would not send their children out of state. His children act very entitled to our money but the way they conduct themselves causes me to doubt they really want a relationship with their father and instead just want our money. It's all about money to them. I know they are happy with their current education, but the second M gets something remotely nice they all freak out on me. 

So, do I really deserve to be called an ass when it's not my fault they're jealous and acting entitled? 

Please feel free to give any insight about this so maybe I can try to communicate with B better.",False,False,3,4,2,2,1,3,Fairness,729
1,"AITA for comparing my boyfriend to an autistic child who needed to be driven around to calm down? | I was driving my boyfriend and I back to my house (parents house) where we were staying that night. We had been having an argument about how he acts around my family, I think he's unfriendly to the point of being rude (for example he has walked into a room where my brother was and not bothered to say hi. I've had to tell him to say hello.) At the start I thought it was due to shyness which I was sympathetic to but recently I've gotten a bit of an irritated vibe off him and felt he just can't be bothered making an effort with them.  Anyway, this is what we had been arguing about in the car and he had said ""I'm sorry if sometimes I'm in a bad mood, or tired and I'm not overly enthusiastic around your family"" to which I said that I would understand if you were only like that occasionally, but it's all the time. He then said that it wasn't all the time and I conceded and said ""ok, well you're like that 9 times out of 10"". He flipped at this and called me a liar, saying that I had lied when I said he was ALWAYS like that because I had changed it to '9 times out of 10'. He said I had lied and had admitted it by changing what I said immediately after. I was 100% that this did not make me a liar and I think it's just him nit-picking, but maybe I'm wrong. At this point he was shouting at me which I hate and the argument wasn't going anywhere so I said I was done with it. We were close to my house at this point and I asked him if we were going into my house would he stop shouting as I didn't want my parents seeing that, but he said he wasn't calm enough to do that yet. So I said ""So I have to drive you around until you've calmed down, like you're an autistic child?"" The reason I said this is because I've heard of parents of autistic children having to do this and it reminded me of this. So he completely flipped at this and started going on about how horrible a person I was for talking about autistic people like this. This is coming from someone who used to do an impression of a Down's syndrome person on a TV advert. He says he has changed since he used to do that and isn't that sort of person anymore. So we spent about 20 minutes more driving around as he was threatening if we went back to my house he would go and ask my parents what they thought about what I said. I couldn't care less if they knew what I said but I didn't want them being dragged into the argument. I told him he could message his friends to see what they thought, I don't know if he did. I asked if he had anywhere else to stay for the night as I essentially wasn't able to go home as I was afraid he'd drag my parents into the fight. He eventually said he wouldn't do this and we were able to go home. I don't think he will speak to me until I apologise for the autistic comment. I think he was wrong in calling me a liar when I don't think I was and for having me drive around for ages because we weren't able to go home because he was threatening to make things awkward at home.

1,"AITA for continuing to ask a woman if she would be quieter during a concert when I felt she didn't answer the question with her response | I'm at the city theatre for a concert with a family member. Everyone is sitting down and it ranges from gay men  and a few lesbians to families to a lot of women in their 30’s  at this show.

During the opener, a band which was great, playing some 80’s hits (Hungry Like The Wolf) singing along having a good time, and then the two women behind us start to get loud. Just talking and laughing. And the music for the opener wasn’t really that loud, so they were overpowering the music really. Enough times that the person I was with did the little shoulder glance back so I knew it was bothering them, and I knew it was bothering me, and now I felt justified, it’s bothering the person I’m with.

I actually give it another minute after I decide I’m going to ask them to be quieter because maybe they’re gonna settle. It’s cool to have fun, they’re just a bit too loud. So they continue, and I turn around to face them, and I say and make a point to be as polite as I can (because this is something I’m really working on with frustration) and say “I’m sorry, will you please be quieter?” 

Now this is where I need some feedback to know if I was an asshole. Neither woman looks at me, and I’m directly in front of them, and in their face not as in leaning in, just they have to see me, I’m directly in front, not to the side. The one I’m really talking to, the woman behind me who might be a bit older than me but not a huge amount, says “Sorry.” I want to be clear, this wasn’t a nice sorry. It wasn’t like a genuine “Oh sorry” where she might not have even known she was too loud, and I didn’t want to embarrass her, I would have said no worries at all, have fun, just thanks for being quieter.

But she doesn’t, and it’s a throwaway sorry. And she doesn’t even look at me. I’m really not angry, but I’m not accepting that as an answer, because it’s the kind of treatment where it would be very possible for her to just go back to doing it in a minute. So I say, “You don't have to be sorry, but will you please just be a little quiter?"" I’m sorry” same tone as in she might as well have said fuck off, and no look to me but just above me. ""I really don’t want a sorry, are you gonna be quieter yes or no?” The person I’m with presses my leg so I know reel it in, so after she says “I said I was sorry” I turn around and leave it.

And it’s not a problem again.

Hindsight being 20/20 it would have been better all around to have just turned back after the sorry and if she continued then acted again.

So AITA for pressing it? Reading it back it sounds like it, but it was just a moment of really offering as much as I could to be a polite about it and when it was just a whatever given back to me I wanted it settled. I do get that me obviously imposing a yes or no answer on a stranger likely paints me the asshole, but it was asked as a genuine question, I just dropped polite words as it went on.",False,False,3,4,1,3,1,2,Fairness,609
1,"AITA for refusing to switch sides of the bed with pregnant wife? | My wife is about 12 weeks pregnant with our second child and recently she asked me to switch sides of the bed with her. I've slept on the right side of the bed for as long as I can remember, every house, every relationship, back to when I was a kid living at home with my parents. Right now we're in the process of buying a home so we're living in a small two bedroom double-wide. The two bedrooms and the bathroom are the end of the hall on the left side of the house in a sort of U-shape. Our bedroom is small and from my wife'e side of the bed it's maybe a ten step trip, unobstructed. From my side it's probably about seven or eight steps. Not really a huge difference, and on my side there's a large dresser.

I politely told my wife I wasn't going to switch. She got huffy with me and told me I obviously didn't have any concern for her condition or our unborn child and I didn't care about making her life easier. I pointed out that when she was pregnant with our older child we lived in a small two story apartment where the bathroom was on the ground floor and the bedrooms were on the second floor and she never had any trouble with that, so why is this any different? She's not high-risk, she's having moderate-to-light morning sickness that has been lightening up over the last couple weeks. She's chasing our toddler around with no problems. I'm sympathetic to her situation, I really am, of course I want my wife-pregnant or not-to be comfortable and happy but I don't see how this small change is going to make a lick of difference.

I don't ask for much. We're an equal relationship as far as childcare, housework, financial, work, etc. I don't sit on my butt drinking beer and watching her do everything, I get up and do my part and then some. It's what keeps us happy and our relationship good. All I'm asking for is to keep my side of the bed. But my wife insists that if I don't give her my side of the bed that it means I hate her and the unborn baby. No amount of my trying to show and tell her how much I care about her and the baby will change her mind.

Another reason I don't want to switch are because my wife has to have a fan on when she sleeps and the only place we can keep the fan is on her side of the bedroom. We only have two outlets in the bedroom, the kind where each outlet has two sets of plugs, one on top, one on the bottom. One is behind the top of the bed and the other is on the wall beneath the window on her side. I'd be too cold. My side of the bed is just the right distance to be comfortable. I'd need extra blankets and my wife says it'll make her too hot so I can't do that. And her side is right next to the window and I have trouble with bright light when I first wake up, I get headaches.  

I don't know what to do. I know this is a really stupid hill to die on and honestly I'm ready to give up, but I'm still just really confused, like why is this a big deal? AITA because I just want to keep my side of the bed?",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness,606
1,"AITA for supposedly ruining my girlfriends big moment after she received a prestigious scholarship? | My girlfriend and I are in our early 20’s and have been together for 6 months. A few days ago she found out she was selected as a Fulbright finalist and will be moving to Europe in August for 10 months. I’m extremely proud of her and I’m happy that she’s fulfilling her dreams but I can’t help but feel a little sad that she’s leaving. I’ve been trying my best to keep those feelings contained and to just be happy for her but it’s been a little difficult and I’ve sort of been distant with her these past few days. 

Last night we were at a bar celebrating this girls birthday party but also kind of celebrating my girlfriends huge achievement. Long story short, she started posting on Instagram and Snapchat right next to me about how she’ll be living in Europe in a few months and will meet one of her friends in Paris. I didn’t say anything but having her flaunt that in my face when she knows it’s a sensitive subject brought down my mood and made me shut down. She then went to the bathroom so I got on my phone for a little bit and was still on it when she came back because I was reading something. Admittedly, I didn’t really feel like talking at that moment and the phone was my escape but I couldn’t have been on there for more then 5 minutes after she came back. She then told me I looked miserable and to go home if I was having such a bad time. I told her I wasn’t having a bad time and I was here for her. I questioned why she was upset and she kept telling me to just go home because I looked miserable but I said no. She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as I followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling me to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to me saying “BABE” implying she wanted me to follow her and get in the car but I just said “No, I’m not going with you” so she gave me the middle finger and took off. That last bit made me upset and I texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn’t some game where she runs away and I immediately go chasing after her. She said I looked miserable when I was on my phone and humiliated her because I couldn’t even hold a conversation. Today we talked about it more and she says that she’s incredibly hurt because it’s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around me. She says my excitement for her isn’t genuine and that I say all the right things but don’t mean them. She says she understands that I’m sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure I felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration we would start having those conversations about how she’s feeling. In response I said, “If it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we’ve really talked about it. I’d know that something this big is obviously a good thing but it affects you too as my girlfriend so I’d try to be aware of your feelings.”

I transferred to this university and have already made a good amount of friends. One of my close friends at the university lives next door to Troy. We saw Troy in one of our classes since he is in the same major as us so we thought we'd introduce ourselves. He tells us he does not have a bunch of friends which motivates my friend and I to help him make friends. At this point, Troy seems like a cool dude so far. 

We start inviting him to parties and other social events to help him make new friends. Almost every time he gets to the parties we invite him to, he goes off by himself to socialize with other people, which is good. But I noticed that when we meet up with him after Troy's wandered off, he acts differently. He acts as if he we were friends for a long time and becomes rude to us in front of his new associates. For example, when we tell him that we are planning to leave the party, he tells us to stop trying to rush him or says something like ""does it look like I want to leave with you guys right now?"" in front of his new ""friends"". Like bro, we are just telling you we are leaving. He would talk down on us as if he has superior intellect compared to us, always sounding condescending.

Couple months pass and Troy takes some classes abroad in Europe for like 2 months. Troy comes back from Europe and he starts saying stuff to us in Dutch (he's not European) and talks with a Dutch accent. Fast forward 1.5 years later, we all have summer classes together. We invite Troy to a kick back with a couple of my other friends. He still brags about Europe and talks with a German accent. My friends and I find it very annoying that this guy clings onto this one thing and talks as if he himself is German. For example, we would talk about some subject and Troy would be like ""Well in the Netherlands..."".

 Like dude stfu, it has been so long since you've been there, Stop clinging onto that ONE thing. So I tell him  ""no on cares that you have been to Europe for like 2 months that happened more than a year ago and stop trying to be something you are not. No one finds it interesting that you do that. Not only that, you are always acting like you are smarter than everyone else when you're not. Sure you got the academics, but you are a social fuck up. No other people are trying to hang out with you but us because we feel sorry that you have no friends. Like we are trying to help you make new friends but you keep throwing us under the bus and being a douche to us, how do you think we feel when you do that?

1,"AITA for refusing to pretend to buy my girlfriend drinks? | This is going to be ridiculous. Forgive me.

A few weeks ago my(31m) girlfriend(22f) of 8 months invited me to go bar hopping with two of her friends. They are also a couple so this was a double date. I don’t like her friends but I agreed to go to make her happy.

As she was putting on her makeup, she told me she had to ask a favor. She asked me to pretend to pay for her drinks in front of her friends. She said she would give me cash before we left to make it look like I am paying when she is actually paying for herself. 

From the beginning of our relationship we’ve agreed to keep our finances separate. We buy gifts for holidays and birthdays, but do not pay for each other for anything else. We pay separately when we go out to eat. If she asks me to pick up something just for her when I’m at the store, she gives me the exact change back. I like this arrangement as it proves to me she is not with me for my money. Obviously I would not be with her for her money as she is a poor college student. 

It’s come to my attention that her friends are much more shallow than she is. I was shocked by her asking me to pretend to pay for her. I asked her why. She said her friends tease her because I never pay for her. I said I’d think about it. I felt inadequate as a boyfriend when she said that to me. I started wondering if I should just pay for her. Then I realized that this is manipulative on her part even if unintentionally. I was not going to be guilted into paying for her, or be humiliated for not paying for her.

I told her no which ended up snowballing into a bad fight. She started to cry and said that her friend’s boyfriend (the one we were going drinking with) always spoils his girlfriend and it makes her feel bad I never do that for her. It made me feel like shit to hear that. We agreed that it was for the best to keep our money separate and now she wants to flip the script. I spoil her in other ways. I allow her to live with me rent free because I love her. I told her that I don’t care what her friends do in their relationships because the only thing that should matter is what works in OUR relationship. 

We went out for the night and I refused to play along. She ended up paying for both of our drinks for the night. When I’d go to ask for 2 checks she’d passive aggressively say it was “fine”. 

Things were a bit tense after that night, but a few days later things were back to normal. Or so I thought. We got into a small fight last night again about something unrelated. She brought up that situation again, saying I acted like a complete asshole that night. Now she is giving me the cold shoulder.

I did not think I was an asshole. I thought she is immature to want to make her friends think I’m her ATM. However I’m starting to wonder if I should’ve handled it differently because she is very upset.

When Rachel fell pregnant she told everyone that they would be waiting until the baby was born to find out the gender, wich really didn't suit any of my family and especially not me as I would like to buy little bits and pieces for baby as the months go not suddenly find out and have to buy everything at once.


Knowing my sister who is extremely impatient in all matters , I knew she would end up getting a gender scan even if she didn't tell her husband Nick. 

So every day i would sent her a message asking if she knew yet and would drop the question in to conversation. 


She told our mom I was driving her insane with the constant asking but I think it's 1000% normal to be excited to know if you'll have a niece or nephew and to begin baby clothed shopping.

Anyway fast forward to Rachel being 17 weeks pregnant,  I sent her a text asking if she knew yet and lo and behold she text back saying yes she had a scan and it was a girl.

I was through the roof with excitement but then Rachel text me again to say that she wanted gender neutral gifts only.

She was extremely adamant about the gender neutral gifts so i did 80% neutral and jut got a few pink dresses and frilly pink sleep suits as they were gorgeous.

Fast forward to 36 weeks,  Rachel drops bomb number 2.
She sends a group message on whatsapp to say that as she will be needing a c section because her baby is breech she only wanted herself and Nick at the birth.

She tried to talk me round via text saying she was terrified and that she wanted peace and quiet for her c section and said although I don't mean to i talk alot in exiting situations. 

I found that incredibly insulting but dropped the issue as she wouldn't budge.

Rachel never got a gender scan, instead she told me it was a girl to stop me asking her every day.

1,"AITA for refusing to pay for a laptop my daughter ""broke""? | My niece, Samantha (19), has always been a prickly girl but I never quite expected this. My husband and I have been visiting family and while we have been spending time sight seeing and spending time with my sister, Samantha has been babysitting our child. I use the word babysitting very lightly here. My daughter (Lila) is very quiet and well behaved and babysitting basically consists of being in the same house as her while she plays games on her phone, reads or watches TV. Lila is not loud or very boisterous, so it's not a big deal. Despite this Samantha kicked up a real fuss when she was asked to look after her and demanded compensation, saying that expecting her to help out was unfair unless she was getting paid. For reference Samantha isn't a social butterfly and she basically lives at her computer, and I believe she did all of this just to be rebellious and cause a fuss, but that's besides the point. Just providing some context about her character .Her mother ended up paying her in the end and aside from some initial grumbling when we left the first few times, things settled down. Until a few days ago.

We arrive and Lila is crying and Samantha is in HYSTERICS, claiming that my daughter went into her room while she was in the bathroom and spilled soda all over it and now it's completely ruined. She shows us the laptop and it won't turn on at all. She then doesn't ask but tells my husband and I we WILL be paying in full for new one. Now, here's the thing: one, Lila absolutely hates soda. Hates it. Fizzy things make her feel sick and she outright refuses to drink anything but water. Samantha, on the other hand, guzzles it down like it's nothing and easily goes through 2L a day. Two, Lila is a small girl and is nowhere near big enough to somehow get up onto a bed or desk just to upturn soda on it. We asked Samantha where her laptop up and she said on her desk. How on earth was Lila meant to get up to her desk to begin with? It's taller than she is. Three, as I recall Samantha had a big history of lying as a little girl blaming other people for what she did. She would break something and immediately point fingers at somebody else and I don't see that having changed. Four, Lila insists she didn't do anything and she didn't even leave the living room. I trust my daughter.

My husband wanted to give in despite all of this but I put my foot down and refused. I'm very confident that it was Samantha, not Lila, who ruined her own laptop and she just saw my daughter as a convenient way to get a new one from us as her mother doesn't have a lot of money. I don't want to enable that behavior or make Lila feel as though I don't believe her. My husband agrees that he thinks Lila is innocent and my sister told Samantha she was out of line to shout at us demanding money, but this has caused a big ripple throughout the family and Samantha has stormed off to her fathers house and now he's hassling my sister over it all.

1,"AITA for asking my fiancee/girlfriend [28F] to work 80 hours a week in order to pay off her debt in time for our marriage? | I have been doing the same thing since last November.

I have $70K in debt, all of it student loans. I got a second job. It will take me until the beginning of next year to pay off my debt.  I am looking at working about 80 hours making $130K. It sucks, but I realized I am not going to get out of debt quickly any other way.

She has around $60K debt.  She financed her father's treatment for cancer (who is thankfully in remission) on credit card.

She works as a teacher working 60-65 hours a week making around $65K. I told her if she works another 15 hours tutoring people she can easily make $15K-$20K. She can easily be debt free in around 18 months. If she gets another job or starts tutoring people, I can help her and she'll be done quicker.

She is calling me an asshole because she already ""compromised"" by agreeing to do a budget.

I told her doing a budget means nothing if we are not cutting our spending and increasing our income.

She said that working 80 hours a week will be bad for her mental health (she has a history of depression).

I told her that I had/have depression (as diagnosed by the doctor).  If I can do it, she can as well. I also told her that her mental health will be worse with the debt hanging like an albatross on her neck. Hell, paying of debt is important for my mental health because it is stressing me out.

She resents the fact that she, in her words, ""never sees me"" and that this will hurt our relationship.

I told her that if we didn't figure out our debt problems, we would definitely get divorced because money problems cause fights.

She said I was a asshole and cheapskate because I am demanding we reduce our spending on food by not going out, not eating fancy stuff like avocado, and not spending money on Netflix. Currently, we are paying $450.  She thinks that $350 per month on groceries between the both of us is too low.  It isn't.

Breakfast: Milk and banana ($0.40)

Lunch: spaghetti ($2) or salad ($3.50). 

Dinner: two cheese ($2) or tomatoes/cucumbers without cheese($2.50) sandwiches.

Total is ~$5-6 per person per day, per month ~$180. We can meet the $350 guideline if she stops buying avocado ($0.50 per avocado), she only eats salads on the weekends, and we shop at a different grocery store for some other things.

I told her to cancel her gym membership ($40). She can run on the streets. She called me an asshole for suggesting this. Apparently, I wasn't checking my ""male privilege"" because she feels afraid as a woman, running at night. She has never told me this before. I told her we can arrange our schedules so she can run with me. I cancelled my gym membership and run alone in the park. 

She wants to go on a honeymoon after our wedding, but if we don't get out of our debt, I am not going to enjoy the honeymoon because I will feel guilty due to debt.

1,"AITA for telling my brother maybe he'd have a different perspective if he ever left the small town he lives in? | On a recent trip home to England I got into a fairly robust discussion with my brother about people who choose to raise their children gender neutral. I was in England with my husband as we were visiting my friends and family. I am English but we live in his home country, Australia, where we've lived for 12 years. We get back to visit every 2 years or so. One evening, about 10ish days into the trip my brother, his gf and another friend of theirs came to my parent's house (where we were staying for the duration of the trip) for supper. My brother lives in the same small, rural town as my parents, about a 5 minute walk away. He never leaves this town, other than to go to work in a nearby, larger town. I cooked a meal and we all (me, my husband, my parents, my brother, his gf, and their friend) sat around eating and chatting. It was so lovely to have my family in one room as the relationship between my parents and brother had recently become difficult.

In the context of a discussion about gender fluidity, we began talking about the subject of raising children gender neutral. My brother was adamant that it was a bad way to raise children, whereas my husband and I put forward points that disagreed with him. The discussion wasn't passionate but robust. I argued that kids don't need gendered toys and that an absence of this might give kids more freedom to think of themselves in their own way. Neither my brother or I have children so the discussion was hypothetical. He argued that not gendering children might lead to an absence of workers in certain stereotypically ""macho"" fields, eg. deep sea welders (his example). While I argued that I didn't think this would happen because gender neutral doesn't mean boys can't do stereotypically boy things and girls, stereotypically girl things - it potentially offers children choice for girls to engage in ""boy"" things and boys, ""girl"" things.

I became frustrated that he wasn't picking that up and resorted to telling him that if he ever left the small town he lived in he might get a wider perspective on social issues. I knew it was a low blow but said it anyway. He left after supper, saying goodbye. The next day I received a Facebook message from him stating that he ""didn't want to know me anymore"" and that I shouldn't come back every 3 years and judge the way he lives. I didn't respond because I was hurt, shocked and didn't want to give oxygen to what I thought was an overreaction. He proceeded to cut off contact completely. I haven't spoken or had contact with him in a year now. I recently tagged him in a funny IG post that I knew he'd appreciate bc I wanted to try a softly softly approach to get in touch. He blocked me, and has completely cut me off.

I recognise that I shouldn't have had a cheap dig at him, but I'm really upset that a previously close relationship now no longer exists because of one comment I made. AITA here?

TL;DR: I told my brother maybe he'd get a better perspective on gender issues if he left his small town once in a while. AITA?",False,False,3,4,2,1,2,3,Fairness,582
1,"AITA for expecting my girlfriend to drive me to work? | So, here's some backstory. I (23TM) had my partner (21F) of a year move in with me last month. She works online for a local office, and I work 30min away at a fish hatchery. I have epilepsy and can't drive, and until recently I had been paying a friend quite a bit to drive me to work because my apartment isn't by a bus. Leading up to moving in, my girlfriend had been giving me rides more often, and seemed happy to help. We've never gotten into any argument we weren't able to solve within half an hour or less. We are both very peaceful, we have all of the same hobbies, and just generally get along great.

&#x200B;

We both like more traditional relationships. I would never expect anything of a partner other than being equal, but right from the start she made it clear she wants to be a homemaker, cleaning and having me come home to hot meals every day, and eventually we want to adopt and raise kids with her at home. It is a relationship dynamic that works well for both of us as she doesn't do well with traditional jobs (anxiety), and most of the time I don't have it in me to cook or clean when I get home. I do not ask her to pay rent because she doesn't work very many hours, but she does pay for our groceries, our cell phones, some dates, and is all around a very helpful person.

&#x200B;

Today, she brought up how it is inconsiderate for me to assume she will give me a ride to work every day since she moved in. She isn't even mad that I didn't formally ask her, she just that she thinks it's too much for me to expect. I tried to explain how I felt to her and apologized for assuming anything without talking about it first. I also mentioned I felt it was something you should just do in a long term relationship. I did NOT say that I feel I deserve rides because I pay rent, or say/even think anything like that, but the way she reacted made me feel as if I had shamed her or something when I have never mentioned anything like that, just the rides. She shut me out for the rest of the day, and I had to pay my friend to drive me when I really didn't have the money. When I got home, she was asleep.

&#x200B;

My least favorite thing is being shut out and not being able to resolve things immediately, and she knows this. There is nothing barring her from being able to do this, she can work whenever she wants so it doesn't hinder that, also it's not money because she is able to save tons by not paying rent. She often goes out when I'm at work (which I don't have any problem with, she can go out whenever she wants), so she is driving anyway. I don't think it's too much to ask for, but she does, and even said that she doesn't want to feel used for rides, but I don't want to feel used either. I do realize that she would be spending 2+ hours a day driving me which is the reason I'm questioning if I'm completely wrong on this one.. So AITA here, or is she being unreasonable?",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness,581
1,"AITA for not changing my “argument routine” now that my wife and I have a child? | So my wife and I have been married for 2 years, together for 5 years total, living together almost the entire time. For the longest time, we’ve had pretty much the same “routine” when we get into arguments. Usually it starts out with me either forgetting to do something or doing something wrong, she sees it, lets loose on me about it, and decides that it’s now a good time to bring up all the other shit I do or have done since our last argument that bothers her. I do my best to listen but once we reach the point where she’s laying it on too thick or I feel like she’s being unfair, I leave the house. If it’s a Friday or Saturday I just got for a long walk around the neighborhood and come back a couple hours later. Any other day of the week I’ll drive to my job, which I have a key for, and try to catch up on some paperwork for a couple hours. I then go back to the house. Usually by then she has calmed down, but if not my last resort is to go stay at a friend’s house or I’ll go back to work and sleep in the empty retail space upstairs, I’ve actually got a pretty cool setup there with an air mattress and a travel toiletries kit I put together last year. 

Despite the fact that we get into these arguments, we have what I would call a pretty good marriage. 6 weeks ago, it changed a lot because my wife gave birth to a little boy, our son. She’s got another 6 weeks of maternity leave, I had 2 weeks off then I had to go back to work. Last night we got into our first big argument since he was born. I went through my usual routine, and ended up deciding I needed to sleep at work that night. When I woke up this morning, I had dozens of angry texts and a few missed calls (my phone automatically goes to Do Not Disturb after midnight) from my wife. She was pissed that I’m still “pulling this crap” after the baby was born. She’s always understood my routine before, and actually at one point said she was happy that I’m able to turn a bad night into a good morning (because I get extra work done and I’m always on time the next day). I get that she would want help with the baby but he was fine when I left, he was asleep in his bassinet and he had just had his diaper changed and drank a full bottle of milk about an hour before that. I can’t stand to be in the house when she’s going on her rants and I don’t see why I should have to sit there and take it from her just because at some point in the next few hours she might need help with something. Maybe she should’ve thought about that before she decided to belittle me. I love her and my son and I’d be happy to help with any of his needs but I have to stand up for myself, I’m not going to be a pushover and let her walk all over me just because her hormones are acting up.

1,"AITA for reporting a group of girls in my class for being excludatory to myself and others | I'm a 19 year old college student studying art & design. It's a small class with under 20 students, most of whom are female. There are only 3 guys in the whole class, one of which is myself. Over time the class has naturally divided into 2 separate social groups. One one table there is a group of girls and 2 guys who are quite studious/quiet, they tend to just get on with their work. On the other table there's another all female social group who are very boisterous and chatty. I sit on the edge of this table.

Now, the girls on my table are by all means not awful people. However, being the only guy on the table I have noticed that they treat me significantly differently.

With each other, they're always joking around and having banter, spouting memes and generally goofing off. Whenever I interact with them, they are friendly and polite, but they don't have any banter with me. It's like they think I'm incapable of having fun, when in fact that's my EXACT sense of humor and pretty much how I am with my bros.

Another thing I noticed is that with each other they talk about movies and video games, two things I'm really interested in. Not once have they spoken about those things with me. Usually they will only talk to me about classwork. I also noticed that I seem to cease to exist when they're all present, but if only one of them is in early or something, and I'm the only available option, THEN they'll talk to me.

They very rarely interact with the two guys on the other table either. To me it definitely comes across like they dislike us just because of gender.

I recently started feeling more and more excluded when I would hear the girls on my table talking about stuff in their group chat (which I'm not a member of), and hearing about them hanging out outside of class and having all these inside jokes I can't understand.

So, that brings us to monday of this week. I arranged to have a meeting with our main tutor after class, in which I basically told him everything I've written here. He pretty much said there isn't much he can do in a situation like this because he can't force friendships. He said the only time he can really get involved is if there is actual bullying going on.

I then asked the question ""Is socially isolating somebody to the point where they want to drop out of college considered bullying?""

He said yes it would be, so I said that would mean I am being bullied. My tutor said he would then have a talk with the girls on my table, and I went home feeling better about the situation.

Turns out I shouldn't have felt better because now things are worse. When I came in the next day I was ignored completely. They don't even attempt to talk to me anymore. I also get the impression that they're constantly laughing at me in their group chat.

I've spoken to a friend about the situation and he said I should never have gone to my tutor about it. I disagree and think it was worth a shot, but I'm open to other perspectives. So reddit, AITA?",False,False,3,4,2,3,1,4,Fairness|Proportionality,577
1,"AITA for telling a professor that I think his class is a joke and walking out? | So this semester I started taking a intro web design class. Despite attending 3 classes though no one has any clue what to fucking do for the class. This is where J comes in. J is a 60 something guy who is the professor for the class. He's some industry guru who made a lot of money in web programming and he let us know that right off the bat.

&#x200B;

The problem with J is that he spends the who lecture time trying to be ""hip"" and impress us by being funny and making ""radical"" comments. He starts each lecture by pulling a desk to the front, taking his shoes off, and connecting with us. He then proceeds to just stand there and ramble about stuff that is vaguely related to the topic while not teaching us anything. Wednesday he spent over 25 minutes letting us philosophies on how we should layout a web page despite the fact he hasn't taught a single html tag in class.

&#x200B;

The worst part by far though is the work load. For the next 14 days we have various small irrelevant things due and almost 4 chapters of reading. Despite being a web programming class, tonight we have to write a page paper pretending to ""advertise"" our website. The thing that pissed me off though is that he never announced any of this in class or though the announcement channel. Last night we had our first reading and first project due (4th day of the semester). We had to build a simple site in html despite the fact he never announced that 2 chapters of the book were due or the project in class. This morning when we came people were complaining and he told them ""tough luck"" and to pay closer attention to the due dates.

&#x200B;

As class was getting started people were still complaining so he announced that he would reopen it for tonight but I raised my hand and told him that it still does not make it right because he has yet to teach us anything about html. He then told me that it's my responsibility to read and learn and that he wont be repeating what's said in the book because that is ""not his job"". He then said that the book will teach us and we are supposed to come to class with that knowledge.

&#x200B;

Most of the kids in this class are freshman with only 3 or 4 seniors like myself filling the credit requirements. I have never had a class like this and every programming teacher i've had at least introduced us to the languages before and I told him this. He got defensive and told me that this is preparing me for the real world. So I stood up and with everyone looking at me told him ""Well, if the real world will consist of a out of tough old man who is more concerned about being cool than setting the people below him up for success then I might as well give up now. If it isn't clear i'm dropping this class. You're a clown and i'm not sticking around for this"" and walked out.

1,"AITA for asking my brother and his fiancee to change their wedding date? | My brother has been with this girl for 7 years. They were never interested in getting married until I got engaged. She got my brother to propose with my mom's costume jewelry. It wasn't even a real ring. They announced their engagement only a few weeks after mine. It was a slap in the face because my fiance went through the trouble to save up for a real diamond ring and he planned a romantic getaway to propose to me. My brother and his fiancee got engaged on the fly with a fake ring and everyone was congratulating them like it was a real engagement. It cheapened my engagement, honestly. My brother was never into the idea but she forced him because they have a child together and he lives in her house.

My brother's fiancee has always been controlling and weirdly jealous of me, and I noticed that she copies everything I do. I wanted my wedding to be a unique event because my fiance and I waited so long to get married. We have been together for 9 years.

We announced our wedding date and then my brother and his fiancee announced their wedding date right after us. They set their wedding only a month after mine. It annoyed me but I didn't say anything. Then I found out that she scheduled her bachelorette party the same weekend as mine. Also, she copied my dinner menu and stole some of my decoration ideas. It looks like their wedding will be nearly identical to mine.

Some family members who live out of town said that they'll be going to my brother's wedding, but not mine. I was very devastated. They said that it's because the wedding dates are so close together and they can't afford to go to both weddings. I chose my date first and my fiance and I don't live together yet. My brother and his fiancee live together and they have a kid, so why are they rushing to get married?

My mom and I invited my brother and his fiancee over to our house and we asked them to postpone their wedding date. Our weddings aren't until July and August so they have plenty of time to change the date. They made a lot of excuses like they always wanted a summer wedding. I asked them to at least change some things about their wedding so it won't be too similar to mine. They got pissed off. Then I asked why they're even having a wedding. They already have a house and a kid together. My brother's fiancee said that she always wanted to walk down the aisle in a white dress. My mom jokingly asked her if she should even be wearing a white dress because she has a kid. My brother flew off the handle and screamed at us. He called me a lot of names and then they stormed out of my house. It has been about a week and they're still giving us the silent treatment.

My mom and I are trying to work with them to make sure that both of our weddings go smoothly, but they won't work with us. A few of my friends think that I should've left this alone, but I think that I'm justified in asking them to change a few things about their wedding. AITA?",False,False,2,4,3,2,3,3,Fairness,575
