0,"AITA for not giving into my older roommate's demands about my gf? | For context, I'm a 23 year old living in a subletted room of an apartment of a 43 year old professor. No contract, I just give her money each month. When i moved in, I told her that my girlfriend stays overnight twice a week. She said no problem to this. My girlfriend and I are both very quiet and friendly, and we mostly keep to ourselves by watching TV in my room. She's been spending more time during the day on Saturdays (like she'll be in my room Saturday afternoon - Sunday afternoon), but she's actually only stayed overnight once a week since I've lived here. We try to invite my roommate to go places whenever we go out, but she always says no. When I first met my roommate my girlfriend did nOT spend this much time at my old apartment, but since I've moved closer to her we now can spend more time together. So my life has just slightly changed since moving to this apartment, I promise I didn't intentionally omit how much she spends in the apartment. Total, she's probably IN MY ROOM with the door closed for 20 hours a week including sleeping.

My roommate also didn't tell me that there's a chore list of about 50 things that needs to get done every week. No problem, I'm happy to do it if it'll make her happy and make the apartment look nice. I've also driven dinner over to her office when she's been stressed about work. i've tried to be nice.

We're both super busy so my girlfriend comes over once during the weekday from 8:30 - 10:30, and then she comes over to my room on Saturday afternoon around 2, we'll go get some food for a few hours because it stresses my roommate that my girlfriend is in my room. Then we'll come back and watch TV for the rest of the night in my room. GF's then there until Sunday around 3 PM. For context, we're now in my room the ENTIRE time with the door closed and the TV on low, but we used to occasionally do homework in the living room or eat in the kitchen. At first, she didn't like us eating in the kitchen or being in the living room (common spaces) when she got home which I totally understood, so she asked us to eat in my room and not cook in the kitchen so no big deal, we now order out and eat in my room. Also, my girlfriend has never showered here, she showers before at her home so she doesn't have to use our water/shower while she's here.

Roommate has confessed that she often can't tell if we're in my room or not unless my gf's car is out on the street because we're quiet.  Fast forward, my roommate's work has gotten really stressful and she now tells me that it bothers her that my girlfriend is in my room on Saturday because she ""can't focus with more than one person in the apartment"" and she asked that my girlfriend leaves by 12 PM. She also asked that I tell her my schedule of when she is and isn't in the apartment. I now give her 24 hours notice and try to tell her our schedule. I'm a little annoyed at this point because I'm trying to be accommodating, but whatever.  We normally leave at like 2 PM now to go to the library on Sundays because i'm not gonna have a curfew imposed on me at 23, but i'm doing my best.

Now the kicker. What really hurt was that one of my students (I teach 2nd grade in a bad neighborhood) was shot and killed instantly on a Friday. I text my roommate that my gf and I will be in my room all day Saturday because I'm mourning and crying and grieving because you know, my kid was a victim of gun violence. She says she's sorry and blah blah blah, she's nice. THEN Sunday at around 2 PM, I manage to leave the apartment and an hour later (3 PM) while we're out, I get this text message. 

""if possible I’d prefer that you and gf not spend more time here together today. I’m not feeling well and it stresses me out when you guys are here on the weekends, especially since lately it seems to be the whole weekend and not just overnight. I understand you wanted more time yesterday but you did not ask for today and I’ve already asked before that you and Koryne not stay past noon on Sundays. This is my home and I need to have a space in which I feel comfortable."" 

When I saw that text, i just broke down crying. It definitely not the whole weekend? I was heartbroken that someone could be so unforgiving when she knew I was upset about my kid dying. 

it's not just her home, I also pay rent here. I don't know. AMTA? I'm tearing up while re-reading that text. I'm moving out at the end of December which I'm very thankful for, I'm just nervous for these next few weeks. My job is really hard sometimes ( re: my student died) and my girlfriend is my rock through it all. I can't do this without her. Also I keep saying in my room because whether or not my girlfriend is there, I'm in my room with the door closed. So it doesn't really affect the roommate in anyway. 

TL;DR Roomate was ok with gf staying over twice a week, she's actually not. She gave me a list of 50 things to clean every week and I do them. She didn't like us in common spaces so we don't hang out there anymore. She told me to give her my schedule so she know's when we'll be in the apartment and I've done that. I've tried to be accommodating to my roommate about my girlfriend, and roommate was ok with my girlfriend until her work got stressful. She sent a really cold heartless text to me about my girlfriend being in my room 2 days after one of my 7-year-old students was shot. AITA? ",False,False,5,4,2,3,1,2,Care,1054
0,"AITA for not wanting to deal with my best friend’s chaotic life anymore? | I’ve [F26] been friends with this person [F25] since we were 13. She is a great friend in terms of being there to listen. Her family and her have always been poor. Her mother has never been a good role model - keeping publicly abusive relationships, drinking constantly and not being there for her daughter. Her family life over all has always been hard.  She has dealt with depression and anxiety her whole life.

My friend has never been able to keep a job more than a couple months since high school. She just quits randomly. I’ve paid thousands of dollars for her over the years in the form of rent, food and entertainment so that she can enjoy nights out with our friend group. 

She has two children who she sees every other week because her and the dad are separated. When she doesn’t have the kids, she goes on drinking benders. During these, she will start shit with her family members and boyfriends causing huge fights. She just got a DUI a couple months ago and is now on probation but is refusing to stop drinking or doing drugs.

She has wanted to kill herself for years, and has acted on it tens of times. She will blow up everyone’s phones saying she is taking a bottle of pills and then not answer anyone’s calls. This causes her loved ones to leave responsibilities like work, racing around town while in tears trying to find her and getting the cops involved. Last episode she had called me for the first time saying she was going to kill herself which sent me into a panic and i had to go track her down thinking my friend would be dead by the time I got there. Every time is has turned out she didn’t actually take pills and she was saying/doing crazy shit cause she had been drinking. I have stopped inviting her out with new people because she will show up wasted and embarrass me.

I was already distancing myself a bit because I couldn’t emotionally deal with the chaos, but the last straw was when I foolishly let her borrow a few hundred dollars. She had a new job and seemed to be doing well, so I told her yes but I needed it back in two weeks. She promised me she’d have the money back to me “100%”. She said she needed help because her kids’ dad fucked her over on daycare. Turns out she quit that job the day prior (after 1 week of being there) and that she actually needed that money for rent. She told me all of this a week later and genuinely didn’t seem to realize that her story was much different than what she told me before. That deadline is now three months ago. She has brought up paying me back once. She got another job a couple weeks ago and I heard from a friend she already quit it.

She’s had a history of dating physically and mentally abusive men. Yesterday I get a call from her mom asking if I’d seen her because she hadn’t come home. I say no and automatically know what this is about. The night prior she had texted me bragging how she cheated on her boyfriend. This boyfriend has blatantly said to our group of friends that he’s not afraid to beat a woman. I knew he was evil. Turns out her sister told him that she had cheated on him, he drove to her house, broke in, smashed her phone and beat her. She now has bruises all over her and is (hopefully) getting a restraining order. I was not surprised at all, I told my friend he’d beat her one day and my friend (who is also one of her bfs) didn’t believe me. He is an overly-obvious abusive person. Yelling at her constantly in front of strangers, acting crazy all of the time.

In summary, I’m caught up because I have suffered from crippling anxiety and depression but it’s never brought this type of destruction onto everyone around me or myself. It seems at this point she’s choosing all of these awful things to happen to her at this point. (Besides being beat obviously). Blatantly self-sabotaging. Which I know can be from mental illness. Where do you draw the line blaming it on mental illness? I don’t want to be dragged into this anymore. I care about her and her wellbeing but it’s been 10 years of this chaos. 

Something happens every week. And every week either she or her mom will call me to talk about it, thinking that I need to be informed of what happened. The same shit that always happens. Nothing ever changes, and in fact gets worse every year. It brings a lot of stress onto to me and has ruined a lot of days for me, crying, leaving social setting to go make sure she’s okay or sitting around in anxiety over how she’s doing.

0,"AITA for telling my boyfriend off? | I’m (20f) a stay at home to my 4 mo old baby that my boyfriend (24m) & I share. He works over night & sleeps up until an hour before he has to go work again, so of course I’m responsible for our daughter 90% of the time. 

He just got back to work as he spent the entire year that I was pregnant unemployed just because. He is qualified and can easily get a job but he chose not to. He was able to do this because a few years ago I was in a bad car wreck and received a decent amount of settlement money for my injuries. The whole time up until now, we have been paying the rent with my savings. Even now that he works he hasn’t contributed to rent, the only thing he pays for is when we go out to eat. 

For the past week, I have had extreme migraines & dizziness so I scheduled a doctors appt. I spent the night at my grandma’s because the appt was much closer & I figured it would be easier to wake up here since I had been feeling bad & would have to drive less in the morning. 

Coincidentally, his mom & my grandma live in the same complex. After he got off of work, his plan was to go to his moms to sleep. We also agreed the night before that he would watch the baby while I went to my appt. 

He gets out of work at 6 AM. I woke up at 10 AM, appt was at 11:30 AM. It took me a while to get out of bed because of the migraines & dizziness, & I also got up several times in the night to feed/change the baby. I figured by that time he was already asleep but I would call him to wake him up to let him know I was going to be leaving for my appt soon. 

Remember that his mom & my grandma live in  the same complex, meaning it would have taken him less than 2 minutes to stop by & pick up the baby. I asked if he could do this because I was very dizzy, I still had to eat, get myself ready, & get the baby ready. I would’ve been able to save a little bit of time & effort if he would have just stopped by to pick up the baby. If I had to drop the baby off, I would’ve spent more time also because his mom talks my ear off even if I say I’m in a rush.

He said he was not going to come pick her up because he was “trying to sleep” that he would send his mother instead. His mother has spinal issues and cannot walk down the stairs, especially not with a heavy car seat and diaper bag. Aside from that, I would’ve had to remove the car base from my car & install it in hers, which was going to take me even more time & was going to be hard for me to do with my symptoms. 

I get he works over night, & he was “trying to sleep” but he had been home for the past 4 hrs but when I asked for a favor that I never ask for, he’s trying to sleep. We ended up getting into a bad argument & said some ugly things to each other. 

Am I the asshole for telling him off? I have built up over time which I have previously communicated to him but he brushes all of it off.

0,"AITA for using my wheelchair despite my parents' telling me not to? | I'm 21 & Im starting uni. Ive moved back in with my parents. I use a chair in public. I do have the ability to walk, & tend to walk around the house because it is carpeted & has stairs (its a struggle for me).  
 

What happened with my legs- I'm weak. My legs collapse frequently & even if they don't, I'm in constant pain 24/7 if I walk. To the point of crying. I have been to my GP & have been instructed to STAY IN THE CHAIR, until we figure out what the fuck is up with me. I'm not stated as disabled on any of my docs cause I have no diagnosis yet, but have docs from my GP for chair use.  
 

Now the real meat of this is my parents. When we (S/O and I) were moving back in with them, they said to take one of the wheelchairs in the airport to skip ahead of the line. I then had to drop the bombshell that I actually have my own chair & have to use it because my legs are crap. My parents did not like this.   
 

Some info, they see me as an abusive person because I refused to bend over & let them continously treat me like shit (making decisions for me, cutting me off from my family). Saying that I took advantage of them. Anyway, since I've moved back in, they are insistent about me not using my chair. On outings with them & my siblings, they'd force me to walk to look 'normal' and would make comments like ""see? youre fine!"" When then ten minutes later I have to sit down over & over & then pop a few painkillers to just not cry. I've tried to stand my ground but they refuse to listen.  
 

Last night, I was talking about my classmates to them, I was attending everyday, using public transport to get to my campus. My mom then asks me to never use my chair again, saying I shouldn't take advantage of people & I should stop pretending & just be ""normal"". My dad goes into this rant about how I just want to take advantage of people's kindness, stating I'm a cruel person for using the chair. I tried telling my dad that being disabled is difficult & he then said ""then stop pretending & just work through it!"" I insisted that its too painful to ever do that & I have to listen to my doctor until I figure out what's up. He went on about how karma will bite me in the ass & that I will be unloved, jobless in the world cause of the chair. He then instructed me to ditch the chair in the next week, & to lie to all my mates that I am on medication & can walk. I refused. Until I stayed up at night thinking about it & letting it to get to me, because I CAN walk & people do help me.  
 

What if they're right? Should I suck it up & just pop 4K mg a day & limp until my muscles get better? My S/O stands by the fact I need my chair & will stand up for me the next time but I don't know if I want them to do that?

0,"AITA for telling my GF's sister not to touch my newborn son because she insulted him, me, and my GF | A bit of backstory; me and my GF have been together for 3 years and a year ago we found out she was pregnant. I'll admit at the beginning I was not supportive, its my biggest regret. I did a 180 when she was about 4 months along and since he was born he is the best thing in my world. My GF and her sister have always been close, they tell each other everything. Her sister has always been a bit off, thinks she's never in the wrong EVER and the entire world is against her. 

About a month ago, when my son was 4 weeks old, she was angry that her Mom was not giving her enough attention (she bought herself a puppy a few weeks before my son came along. The puppy is a nightmare, and she doesn't discipline it or even take care of it). Since she was not getting attention from her mom she got her puppy and started saying ""Look at the baby. Who's a good baby?"" To the dog and brought him over to my son. The puppy is feisty and squirmed almost scratching my son in his grandmothers arms. I got mad and took my son into my GF's room (we've been staying with her mom since they live far away). When I walked out of the room she called my son a dumb baby and said he was ugly. She came into the room later and told me to give her the baby, I told her no. My GF agreed I did the right thing, but her sister decided I hate her and is taking it out on her mom. She screams at her mom constantly about nothing and told her mom that no one can drive her mom's car (we have been borrowing it while we are here to get around) not even her mom can drive it only her and she will drop her mom at work and keep the keys during the day. 

After a month of her screaming and saying everyone is ruining her life she decided that her dog is more important than her nephew. Her brother was playing with her dog, which she didnt like, he was rubbing its belly while she screamed ""STOP RAPPING MY DOG!!! IM CALLING THE POLICE IF YOU DON'T STOP NOW!!! WHY DONT YOU GO AND TOUCH (GF'S NAME)'S SON'S DICK INSTEAD!!!"". My GF had to stop me from confronting her because I was livid. I decided then that she would not see my son until she got right. 

Last night we were at our friends house, we are a few days from flying back home. She texts my GF angry because her brother told her I dont like her. She started saying some really fucked up things to my GF about her, my son, and me. My GF told me what she was saying and showed me the texts. She told my GF that I dont love my son because when we first found out I wanted to abort. I regret thinking it everyday, he is the best thing and I dont know what I would do without him anymore. I snapped and called her some really bad things to my GF and almost cried because it hurt that bad. I have now refused to let her come visit us and told my GF she should stop talking to her.

0,"AITA for blocking my mother out of my life and refusing to give her a second chance? |  So, this was about a couple years ago, but as of recently, I've been feeling guilty because of it. 

&#x200B;

  I should give some backstory to this first, my mother wasn't the best person, she acted like she loved me sometimes, but a lot of the time she would be quite abusive in the emotional sense. For example, when I was learning how to drive she would constantly make comments about how I was purposely trying to harm and kill both her and my sister by purposely trying to crash the car. Not only that, but she would constantly tell me how terrible of a person I am, how I was compliant with the ""people"" trying to ""get"" her, and she would use that as an excuse to punish me severely for weeks at a time. There's more, but I have trouble addressing this stuff. 

&#x200B;

  Eventually, I broke down and couldn't take it anymore. I wanted away from her as much as possible. I called my dad, told him I wanted to move in with him and then proceeded to tell my mother the same. Instead of becoming angry, she tried everything she could to keep me from leaving (preparing my favorite meals every day, tried to enroll me in a new high school, begged me to not pack my things, etc. Everything but apologize for how she treated me). I ended up agreeing to call every day while I lived with my dad, but this didn't last long. While texting with my sister, I ended up learning that it was my mother pretending to be my sister. After this I was done, I called my mother, told her off and then ended by telling her I wanted nothing to do with her anymore. I blocked her number and I thought that was that. 

&#x200B;

  But as of recently, my mother has been going to therapy and receiving medication for bipolar disorder. I keep being told that she's doing better and that I should reach out and try to reconnect, if not for her sake, for my sister's and my grandfather's sake (I can't see them as much because of my mother and my grandfather is quite old and likely doesn't have many years left.) But I want nothing to do with her anymore, she betrayed my trust on several occasions as well as gave me longstanding problems with depression. But I feel a little conflicted, I feel as if I'm the asshole for not giving her a second chance, or at least not having some relationship with her so I could spend more time with my sister and grandfather, but yet I'm still firm on my decision to not want to have anything to do with her.  

&#x200B;

 So, I guess I should ask you all, am I the asshole for not giving her the second chance or am I justified in not wanting to see her ever again. Most of my family feel as if I should reach out, but I do mostly feel justified, though, no one in my family knows the full extent of the story so I though, so that's why I'm posting this here. 

&#x200B;

0,"WIBTA if I quit my hospitality job the week before Christmas? | This is my first ever post so I’m sorry if I’ve got anything wrong! 

I have been working as a restaurant manager for over 10 years but in September this year started at a new place as a deputy manager to take a step back from the stress of being the general manager. My last general manager job caused me to end up in a deep depression & so I thought I’d be better off as a deputy.

Turns out I was wrong. My job started off great with a promise of having at least 2 evenings a week free, one night so I could play my sport (which helps keep my mental health in check) & I helped the GM with all the rotas & was given lots of praise for the job I have been doing. Recently I haven’t been getting any evenings off in the week, my shift patterns are usually 3-close, 12-10 or 12-close, meaning I’m only free to do anything else on my days off (i.e. see friends, see my boyfriend, see my family, Christmas shopping, tidy the house etc) & worst of all I have been put to work on the days I play my sport, my team aren’t particularly happy with me! 

On top of that my general manager is an AH. He never says hello as we come in, he never thanks anyone for their hard work even though all our reviews have been amazing, he constantly is moaning or telling people off for things that most of the time aren’t even wrong, they’re just not his way (his way changes every week we will never get it right) & people are now fearful of coming to work as they know they will be shouted at as soon as they walk through the door.

Only recently have I managed to end up in his bad books (reasons unknown I have been doing my job the same way since the start). He has undermined me on the rotas, twice now after I spent hours of my time doing them he has then scribbled them out in front of my face & said I have been too nice to staff so he will re-do them. I accepted I would be working all over Christmas because I know the industry but asked if I could maybe not do the whole day Christmas Eve or start a little later on Christmas Day to spend a small amount of time with my family, instead he actually extended my shifts from what I had suggested they could be. He also extended some of my other shifts that week meaning I was working all day on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day & the 2 days after that as well, no time to see my family or my heavily pregnant sister who would be visiting. 

I could go on forever about the things he has done to me lately but long story short, I’m now having daily panic attacks about going to work & have had to return to my GP for help with my depression. Both the GP & my parents think the job is not worth my happiness but I know the staff (who I think are all great btw it’s just the manager who isn’t) will be short over Christmas without me & the GM may have to cancel his holiday he has booked from Boxing Day.

0,"AITA? I told my parents they couldn't see my son unless it was separately. | My parents have been unhappily married for 33 years, ever since they were 16. It was a shotgun wedding on account of my older sister. When I was a kid they'd argue constantly and dad pretty much would live with us for a year, move out for a year, move back in for a year, move back out for a year, and every time they'd say it was over, they were getting divorced, they couldn't make it work, and then dad would move back in and things would resume. They'd also try and bring me and my sister into arguments and get us to say whose side we were on. I moved out as soon as I reached 18 because I was just so tired of hearing them fight all the time. They made it clear they were only together for me and my sister, and we told them at one point that they could split up with no hard feelings from us, but they didn't believe us and thought we were ""putting on a brave face"" for their sake so they stayed together. They refuse to see a marriage counselor or any sort of therapist, separate or together, as they feel it's a waste of time, money, and energy.

My son is 7 years old. I live within 90 minutes of my parents' house, and after my son's father left they offered to help me out with childcare.  I refused initially as he was in preschool so he had someone to go to, but when the school holidays rolled around I had to ask them for some help. One of the first times he was with them for the day (he was 3 or 4 at this point) he came home and told me they'd spent the day fighting, tried to make him pick a side, and he didn't want to go back. I told both of them that spending the day yelling at each other in front of him and dragging him into their fight was unacceptable. They tried to pull my sister into the argument and she offered to watch my son rather than send him back there.

On Saturday around 10 I got a call asking me to come into work for a meeting at 12. I asked my sister if she could watch my son but it was too short notice. I called my parents and asked if they could meet me at my town center, and just watch him for a couple hours and take him to the beach or round the shops. They agreed. I was gone for approx 1hr30 and in that time they had an argument. My son said there was no yelling but they'd tried to make him pick sides again.

I gave it a lot of thought and rang them today and told them that they could only see my son from here on out if they were apart, and if they ever tried to pull him into an argument again they wouldn't be allowed to see either of us.

I feel justified because at the end of the day I'm talking about my relationship with my parents and my son, however in the conversation they did make some valid points, including that my son loves them and wants to see them, they've been together 3 decades, and my dad has a sight issue that means it's not safe for him to drive after dark so he can't come alone until summer.

0,"AITA If I Choose A Random Couple For Adoption Than Stepsister? | 
So I (21F) am in my junior year of college. I’ve been extremely careful on not getting pregnant and have tried all avanues. My IUD moved and I almost died so I had to get it removed, the implant in my arm left a rash and started to burn so I had it removed, so me and my FWB started using the calendar and condom method which is basically when I’m not ovulating we would use the pull out method and when I was we would use a condom and a Plan B just for backup.

Well, I’m pregnant. I found out in the beginning of December that I am four weeks along. I knew immediately I didn’t want to keep the baby. I considered going through with an abortion via the pill. I got them but couldn’t do it. I know that it was selfish, but until you’re in those shoes you never know how it truly feels.

So I decided adoption. I told my friend that I was planning on delivering the baby and she told me about her brother and her sister in law back in her home state that have been struggling with infertility and have been desperately trying to conceive a baby for years without fail. We FaceTimed a few times and I think they would be perfect parents for my baby. They’re both well educated with well paying jobs and an amazing home they could raise a baby in. It actually made me excited to be able to know that the baby will go to a family that so desperately wants them. I decided they would be a great fit and since they’re so far away, it’s like it never happened kinda thing.

I finally brought it up to my mom yesterday that I’m pregnant and everything else. My moms first words were “What about Sylvia? Her and Jon would love a baby”. My older stepsister is 28 and infertile. She’s known this for years and we aren’t that close so I didn’t know if she ever planned on having a baby through other means.

I said no. Sylvia lives in the same city as me and I see her during holidays and any other family gatherings. I don’t want to adopt the baby into my own family circle and still have to be in some form of its life. I would basically become the step aunt? I just prefer the idea of having a closed adoption in a far away state with a picture every once in a while. My mom started gushing and called Sylvia immediately despite my protests who seemed really happy. She told my mom they were looking into an egg donor and a surrogate but this baby is so much less expensive and less of a hassle.

I told Sylvia that I don’t want to give the baby to her for the reasons I listed above and kind of already “promised” another couple that they could adopt the baby. Now I haven’t went through any legal channels via the other couple so it’s not like I HAVE to do it, but I really want to. Sylvia got upset and asked why I would choose a random couple that I know nothing about versus my own “flesh and blood” (Our parents have only been married for 3 years and we never lived under the same roof as she was 25 then).

I am the youngest of 5 and my siblings are a lot older than me. There is a lot of history here, but I have to keep it short. I will gladly answer any requests for more info.

3 of my siblings do very well financially and the other one gets by OK. 2 of them live close by and the other 2 live in another state. None of them have helped out with my mom over the years and I accepted that. I have been a single mom for 24 yrs and things have been tough at times.

My mom has been very ill in the past. I have worked 2 jobs and my adult son moved back home to help. My siblings who live close by did not help with getting her to dr appts, caring for her at home, or any financials. Despite this, they want to remain in contact, be kept informed of my mom's status, and have a say in her affairs.

My son, who was working and going to college full time, quit school to help. I did not ask him to do this and it kills me that he did. When my mom got better, my son landed a better job, saved up money, and prepared to move out again.

My mom then became severely ill with diabetes and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. My son stayed home, I left my job and withdrew my retirement money so I could stay home to provide the 24 hr care my mom needs. My retirement money has since run out and now the burden is falling completely on my son.

My siblings think I should be home caring for our mom and they said they would help, but since having this discussion they claim they do not have extra money or time. I’ve been happy that they are successful and can afford many luxuries. I told them that I don't think anyone is obligated to provide assistance, but I would like for them to make their intentions clear so there are no false expectations or angry reactions to decisions I may have to make (e.g. one of my siblings was unhappy with potential funeral plans due to my financial constraints). I have to get a job and cannot leave my mom alone. She probably does not have long to live so we’re not talking about a situation that will drag on for years. I can try to work overnights while my son is home, but I don't know when I will get any sleep due to so many dr appts. My siblings have the resources to help, but they are not doing so. Yet they cry on the phone when discussing her impending death.

AITA for thinking they should sacrifice a few luxuries in order to help keep our mom happy in her final days and/or the ones who live close by at least help with getting her to appts and taking turns caring for her while I work since they claim to care and want to be involved in decision making?",False,False,5,4,3,2,1,4,Care,591
0,"AITA For Cutting My “Tough Love” Mom Out Of My Life? | I am a 43F single mom of a 13M. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past 12 years. About two months ago, I was having a terrible period in my life, and made some changes all at once. I quit my job, moved back to my hometown, ended my relationship, and went off all my meds. It was a very hard couple of months for both myself and my son. We are both starting to feel better and things are getting back to a good place. I am on different meds and have started a new job. My son is doing pretty good at school and is happy to be back in our hometown. 

The issue is that my ex-fiancé got ahold of my mother when we first moved out to let her know what was happening and that I was not in a good place. My son also reached out to my mother when he was feeling particularly down and wanted someone to talk to. She basically blew him off and never bothered to check back on him again. She never contacted me to check in either.

Some backstory: she believes in “tough love” and “codependency” and believes this means that it’s ok to just basically ignore her children (all 3 of us are adults) if they are struggling, or unhappy, or even need to just talk. By ignore, I mean she has already cut my youngest brother (39 yrs) out of her life because he struggles with PTSD and alcoholism and will not check himself into a hospital which is what she thinks he should do. So she refuses to have anything to do with him and basically pretends he doesn’t exist.

In regards to me, she abandoned me at age 1 to be with the man she cheated on my father with and her two babies she had with him. She did eventually get visitation rights and I saw her on the weekends for years. She was physically and verbally abusive for most of my childhood towards me and my (half-) brothers as well. She smoked pot constantly and drank a lot too. 

Over the years I have done a lot of therapy and pretty much got over most of my issues with her, and have had what I thought was a pretty good relationship with her for about 15 years. It was always up and down, but I just went with the flow and up to now, she has been a decent grandmother. 

Fast forward to now. She hasn’t spoken one word to me since I told her I quit my job two months ago, and as I mentioned, she blew my son off when he tried contacting her when he was upset and worried about me. I honestly never expected her to help me in any way, but a check-in to see if we were ok would have been nice. Now that I know she blew off my son, I am furious and hurt. 

I want to cut her out of my life completely but my best friend thinks I should give her another chance. I think it’s bad enough that she deserts her own children but now that she has deserted mine, I am done. AITA for wanting to just cut the cord and be done with her for good?

0,"WIBTA If I don’t tell my brother I found his cat? | TL;DR at end
Background: I have dogs & cats. All of them have been rescued from being strays/abandoned, etc. I’ve also been fostering for 2 years. Obviously, I love animals. I’m 24 & moved out of my mom’s house 3 years ago when my boyfriend and I got a house together because I didn’t feel my pets and I were safe. Without going into detail, my mother has never been easy to live with but my last 7 years in her house were hell.
About 7 years ago (I was 17), I rescued a starving, sick kitten that I found in a parking lot across the street from a burning building. He was screaming, and alone, & starved. I took him home, fed & took him to the vet. I named him Scout. Because I had pets already, my younger brother decided Scout would be “his” cat. I didn’t mind because I was still living in the same house.
 A few months before moving out, I had worked a 17 hr shift and I got home asking about Scout because I had not seen him. NOBODY else noticed him missing. My boyfriend and I put up posters, walked the neighborhood for hours and put his litter box out. My brother did not help us look. The next night, boyfriend and I again searched all day. Around 11pm, we went out to check the litter box again and he had returned!! When I moved out, I took all the pets except Scout because my brother and mom wouldn’t let me. I begged them to be careful.
Well... not even a month after I moved out, I was told Scout was missing again. ONLY boyfriend and I again searched. We did everything we could to find scout. We kept it up for months but Scout never came home or was found. Over the last few years, I’ve continued to look for him and get email alerts for lost/found pets on my city. I check every one in case it’s him. I was devastated and have felt guilty about not bringing him with me.
Yesterday, while checking the animal shelter page, I saw a freshly posted cat I KNEW was him. By then, the shelter was closed. I showed my boyfriend, and he agrees it’s him. I texted my brother right away and sent him the picture. He said it looks like Scout. When I asked if he wanted to go see him at the shelter, he asked if today. I explained it was closed but he could go tomorrow AM since I can’t go till after work, around 5PM. All he replied with was “yea maybe”.
My boyfriend and I decided we will go after work, adopt scout, bring him home, & not to tell anyone. Would I be the asshole if I do this?
TL;DR: Cat that I rescued as a kitten 7 years ago was deemed my brother’s cat when we all lived together. He was let out to escape from mom & brother’s house a month after I moved out(3 years ago). Brother and mom wouldn’t let me take him with me when I moved. They never helped in extensive search for him.  I’ve still been on the lookout and found the cat in my local animal shelter page, posted for adoption yesterday. Brother didn’t react much when I told him.

0,"AITA for cutting ties with my father 10y ago and refusing to resume communication? | (Scroll for tldr)
My entire family (mum, bro, myself) was hostage to my father's moods. He spent his time isolating us, bullying us, gaslighting us, screaming at us for hours until we cried (or threw up in the case of my brother), throwing landline phones or chairs at my mother (but never actually hitting her, which used to make me think this wasn't *really* bad), and more, until the divorce.

When i hit puberty it became even nastier so I refused to see him and he'd call me a 100 times a day until hearing the phone ring would make me retch, stand in front of my mum's building for hours, scaring the neighbours and occasionally breaking the glass door.
As an adult I went to see him twice a year which led to tons of guilt tripping (5 min after getting to his place for xmas: ""so what do you want to eat next year xmas when you come again?""). I told him I wouldn't take any insult directed at my mother, he'd say ""you know it's not your mum's fault if she is stupid"", which he was really adamant did not qualify as insulting her.

Because I'm petty as hell, what truly prompted me to cut ties was that whenever I opposed him, he'd act as if he was proud of me for ""standing up for myself"".
I realised he was trying to turn this into a ""I made you tough"" narrative and I was not having it. I ghosted him. He sent me 4 letters that all start with ""Well I dont know what I did to you but I'm sorry"". They were promptly binned.

*The twist*: my father has a severe undiagnosed mental illness which contributed to making him this way, notably by ""making him"" an alcoholic, leading to him being unemployed for almost his entire life. I have this same mental illness but much less severe, so I know what it's about. Regardless, he still made the choice to torture us, and not by accident: he brought my mum into his country only to forbid her to learn the language. He then was obsessed with only having daughters (because women are weak and easily controllable, amirite), when my brother was born he was so mad he didn't hold him for the first 6months of his existence. My brother took his 1st steps because my father was screaming and he was trying to get away from him.

Whether or not they know this, people who seem to think I am in the wrong here insist I should forgive my father and resume communication, for... closure?
What I'm thinking is I dont need to forgive anyone! I moved on and this is not part of my life anymore. Speaking to him means teaching him about how much of an ass he is and trying to make him see the light. I feel the efforts would be at 90% coming from me and I'm over this, not a project I am interested in. Besides, would it not be better for him to die alone not knowing - he isnt even really alone because my brother is a selfless angel and takes care of him.

TLDR; My father made my childhood a nightmare but partly due to an undiagnosed mental illness.
Also I'm super petty and I know my decision is somewhat linked to that.

0,"AITA for declining my best friend's wedding invitation? |  

Hi AITA.

tldr; My best friend(28M) and I (25F) have been online friends for roughly 5years. I would say he's one of my bestest guy friends. I have seen him struggle with his relationships, seen him go from job to job and saw him thrive in his current relationship now. Recently he had asked me if I would attend his wedding and I of course said I am going to decline out of respect for his fiance.

Here's some backstory:

He and I met on an online server. We've never actually met in person but we kicked it super well and have continuously stayed friends for 5 years now. When he first met his now fiance, I helped him plan his first date and even now every little detail of how he had custom made her wedding ring to where he had asked for her hand in marriage. I absolutely adore her, at one point we all were in a group chat together, I talked to her privately via text. I thought we were all pretty good friends until about a year ago when my bff told me that his fiance was actually pretty uncomfortable with me. He said every time he brought me up, she would get pretty moody. He would also say that she didn't like that we had so much inside jokes, also how he had a crush on me, just the whole idea of us being friends really made her uncomfortable. I eventually distanced myself so that they can cool off and he made the effort to tell his fiance that there was nothing more than a solid friendship.

We would text nonchalantly but never to the extent of how our friendship normally was. Recently this year we started talking normally again. I miss my best friend but I also told him that I understood boundaries and I never want to make his fiance feel like she is less than or feel like I am competing for his attention, or whatever she may feel. I've always tried to accommodate her feelings to make it known that I was only his friend and even waved my relationship around saying we should go on double dates if I ever decided to meet my bff and her in person to make sure that she knew I had my own relationship and never wanted to step in hers.

So a couple days ago, he had told me that they had a date for their wedding and asked if I would come. I had asked him about how his fiance felt and he stayed silent. I took the silence as she didn't really feel comfortable about me still, so I softly declined out of respect for his fiance because I never want to make her day be less special because of my presence. It sucks because he is my best friend and I would love to be there for him but I know the circumstances wouldn't be favorable.

Personally, I feel like an asshole whether I showed up or not. I know my best friend doesn't want to have to choose between his life partner and his best woman friend. I want to be there for him but I also don't want to make her uncomfortable on one of her biggest days of her life. If I showed up, I am an asshole to her and if I don't, I'm an asshole to my best friend.",False,False,5,4,4,2,2,4,Care,584
0,"AITA for socially ostracizing my manager and getting her fired? | This one happened ~6 years ago but I still think about it from time to time.

I was hired for my first job (a contract position) at a convention for my hobby. I was thrilled to work at a huge-name company with great benefits making cool things, and grateful to this manager for having taken a chance on me. After 6 months I was upgraded from contractor to full-time employee and moved from the large team I started at to an intimate team of 6 people, working directly under my manager as the only non-remote employee in our dept.

Our team worked crazy hours, got little sleep, and were threatened with being disbanded for months. We became very close under those adverse circumstances. Eventually we got out of the danger zone and were able to bring more members to the team, which was nice. The dynamic remained close and we continued to put in long hours. One night I was there at 2am with my manager, and we were drinking since it was after hours in a very alcohol-friendly company, and she confessed that she really liked me. She asked me to break up with my girlfriend and date her instead, semi-jokingly. I laughed it off and said I couldn't do that, but felt disquieted. 

The next day I was wary since I had no idea she felt that way up until then, and started to question if maybe I'd been hired for my appearance and not my work (the person I was hired to replace was my boss's ex (I later found out), and VERY similar in looks to me). My manager asked if I was okay and I said yes but decided to be distant, which changed the vibe. She crossed the line imo when she scheduled a 1:1 during work hours to ask if ""we were cool"" and to talk about interpersonal things. After that I felt her watching me constantly, she'd leave work the same time to talk to me in the parking lot, and would try to corner me to check in on things when I was by myself... eventually I asked a male friend to warn me when she was around because I was so stressed. Our coworkers noticed and I didn't want to tell them about everything so I brushed their questions off, but it was obvious I was avoiding her. The exec of the 10 person team also pulled me aside and asked if I was being harassed but I said no... this situation was made more complicated by the fact that she was trans, and I identified as such as well at the time but did not present. I didn't want to seem transphobic OR have to out myself if that came up. Our big boss was a very Baby Boomer kind of guy who made fun of minorities casually and I didn't want to disclose info to him in particular, although I'm sure he would have done something fair about it. Eventually the team began eating and spending time together without her and after 3 months of being shunned, she quit. 

In hindsight I feel like I contributed to bullying, BUT I also feel like she crossed a huge line with someone she had a lot of professional leverage over, and that I had no choice but to actively avoid her or expose both of us to some overpersonal corporate questions.",False,False,5,4,3,2,1,3,Care,582
0,"AITA for being frustrated that my husband’s father is sick and dying? | A little background, my husband has 5 siblings and grew up in Brazil and I grew up in USA. He lived there his whole life and when we got married (5 years ago) I moved there to be with him while we applied for his residency in the USA. Our ultimate goal was to move to the USA and find work, start a family, save money. 

About 3 years ago, his 80 year old father started to feel tired. It began with him not moving around as much and asking his family to bring him everything to his room. During this time, I also got pregnant and had a baby boy.  We raised our son in Brazil for about 2 years until my husband got his green card. Once he got it, we planned to move to the USA within six months. Well, his father’s health kept declining and for the past year we put off our move to take care of him. I mentioned my husbands siblings because I always felt they didn’t put in as much work as my husband did to take care of their father. My husband was basically his primary care taker. As you can imagine, this is very hard and constant work. His siblings would help out, but most of the responsibility landed on my husband. We found out a few months ago, his father has stage 4 cancer. 

Although this news was heartbreaking, we couldn’t put off our move any longer this year. We had to move to the USA or risk losing the green card and all the money we invested. We made arrangements and my husbands siblings took over the care-taking responsibilities for his father. 

We’ve been in the US for about a month now. Our move was very emotional for my husbands family because they grew accustomed to having us around. My husband is also feeling very guilty about leaving when his father is on his death bed. 

As expected, it’s taken a lot to adjust to life here for all of us. I am currently 7 months pregnant and working. My husband is looking for work but hasn’t been successful yet. On top of that, his family sends him messages saying how much they want him to come back and how much they need him. 

He wants to go back for a couple months and I can’t help but feel exasperated. I love my husbands family and I can understand the absolute stress everyone is under, but I feel like our children and I are being pushed to the side lines. Also, this complicates his residency application.

I have been completely supportive of whatever my husband decides. I always tell him I totally understand what he’s going through and this is his decision to make. But I keep thinking if he goes back, it will only cause more work and stress for me. I basically have to work, raise my son and prepare for birth on my own. On top of that, I would truly just miss my husband so much if it wasn’t here with me. Thinking about him leaving makes me feel so sad and lonely. 

I’m feeling so resentful of my husbands family and that makes me feel guilty. I want to tell my husband that he shouldn’t leave me, but I feel it would sound selfish. AITA for wanting my husband to stay?",False,False,5,4,4,2,1,3,Care,581
0,"WIBTA if I reported my friend for animal negligence? | Basically, around 2 years ago my friend moved out of home and bought two kittens. Due to health issues she ended up quitting her job and staying at home full time living on welfare (I am only mentioning this because I believe it is relevant to the problem). This meant she spent 24/7 in her 1 bedroom flat with her cats. As they grew out of the tiny kitten stage, she said she wanted more. So she bought 3. I was a little worried at first, I didn't know whether she had considered the commitment of having 5 cats but she seemed set on getting them. As she doesn't have work to focus on anymore, her cats have become her entire life.

Fast forward by about 9 months on and the same pattern just kept happening again and again, the cats started getting bigger and then she said she wanted more kittens. I suggested fostering kittens but she said it wouldn't be the same.  Now, she has 10 cats, all under 3 years old. Ultimately, they were being cared for so I stopped getting involved.

That is, until a month ago. I hadn't seen my friend in a while as I've started a teaching job. I thought it'd be a nice surprise to visit her but when I got to her flat, she didn't seem happy to see me at all. Her place was a tip. I know she suffers from depression so I tried to reassure her that there was no need to be embarrassed and helped her clean. As I reached for a box in the corner of the room she shouted at me not to touch it. I looked inside it and saw a bunch of newborn kittens curled up with one of her cats.

She explained she hadn't realised she had male cats and assumed they were all female. She'd never taken any of her cats to the vets, so none had been spayed or neutered or received any vaccinations because she ""didn't see the point in wasting money and putting them through invasive surgery"". While I was there I noticed 3 other cats with protruding stomachs, I asked if they're all pregnant and she said yes. When I asked whether she would consider taking them to be spayed (basically, aborting the kittens) she said absolutely not and that she'd be keeping any kittens she can't find homes for. I can't even do the math on how many cats that would leave her with.

So here's my dilemma. Talking to her is completely useless at this point. I offered to adopt a few of her cats but she refused. One of the pregnant cats is only 9 months old, and the others are not much older. Though all of the cats seem happy I just feel so bad for them. I'm meant to be her friend and I feel awful for considering this.

I would warn her first but I don't think it would achieve anything, I think if I told her she'd just freak out and threaten to harm herself, as she has done that kind of thing in the past. But I also think reporting her could mean all of the cats will be taken from her and I genuinely do not know if she'd mentally recover from that.

0,"AITA for making my mother cry | So recently for context, I've had trouble finding work due to my condition (Epilepsy) I'm unable to do EXTREMELY fast paced work (Fast food, warehouse work, etc). So it's been a trying time for me. My Mother allowed me to stay with her and her boyfriend just until I can get on my feet. 

So 3 months into the stay, I've had 2 jobs, none I could keep and have been holding down minimal work doing video editing for people. I've been paying her (although not huge amounts).

So 3 days ago, she comes home late and drunk with her boyfriend and my 2 other younger siblings in the car. I ask how everything went and she tells me I have until tomorrow afternoon to leave. I at first say ""Are you sure, let's talk about it more tomorrow."" And the annoying bf loud mouth gets in my face and says ""SHE'S SURE!! WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH YOUR SHIT ANYMORE!"" 

Next day comes and my stuff is outside. I try to talk to her but I can't say anything without her asking her bf.

I ask her if she can let me sleep in her car for the night in exchange for $10. She tells me ""NO! YOU ARE 19, YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU CAN FIGURE YOUR OWN SHIT OUT!""

So I've spent the last day or two looking for homeless shelters in my city, and any resources for homeless people, none for Men. All for women. I slept on a park bench last night in the pouring rain. So morning comes, I knock on her door and ask to take a shower. She asks her bf On speakerphone if I can, and he says ""if it's over 10 minutes, call the police"" So I quickly shower and I start the dreaded argument with my mother.

So I told her this during the argument ""You would really let your own son, freeze out in the cold rather than let me wait just until I get my tax return (already filed) and get out""

Then she said the words that sent me into rampage ""If you die, that's your fault, I am not going to help you with your problems"" I spent the next 20 minutes cussing her out until she broke down crying.

She attempted to call the police on me for cussing her out, in her words ""Abusive behavior"" After they found me, they brought me back and assessed the situation and told me to go so everything could calm down. I asked if there were any resources for homeless people and they told me ""No.""


My mother has gone on to lambast me to other family members over social media and has essentially ruined most of my relationships with family under the guided lies and puppetry of her bf.

0,"AITA if I cut off an old friend over a cat? | I posted yesterday about a big blowout I had with this friend over declawing her cat. I was mad about her doing that and she was mad about me judging her in front of other friends. Big fight. She ended the friendship. The post here got deleted since the powers that be decided it was a debate post about declawing. 

You'd think that makes this moot, but my other friends who have been talking to her suggest that in time she'll cool off and want to be friends again, and that I shouldn't make rash decisions like ""well fuck you then if you're going to overreact so much to criticism.""

Here's the thing.

When this friend, Thyme, was angry, she texted our other friend Avocado saying she couldn't talk to me as I am a brick wall and a bully, and she doesn't want to go down the rabbit hole again, so could Avocado let me know how she feels?

...We're almost 30. 

So Avocado let me know, per Thyme's request. I texted Thyme to say that if she's really done being friends we should arrange a custody agreement of our other friends so they don't get caught in the middle.

She got pissed and sent us all: ""Custody agreement decided. I'm 100% out."" As in, not being friends with any of us (me, Avocado, and our other friend Books). 

Avocado was stunned because she'd been letting Thyme vent to her and she just cut her off because she lives with me and I have bitch cooties or something. 

Hurt, Avocado tells me, ""Well, if we're going scorched earth, you should know that she had Whiskers put down.""

Whiskers was a 2/yo cat that Thyme adopted. He was healthy but incontinent. Thyme decided she would euthanize. I'd objected - told her it was shitty of her to put him down when he was otherwise healthy, and that she could rehome him. (She has a barn but Whiskers couldn't be an outside cat because she declawed him, just as she has done to the other >10 cats she has.)

Thyme got sick of it and told me she rehomed Whiskers at an apartment complex. Except she didn't. She confided to Avocado last week that she put him down because she ""had no way of knowing if someone else would do something to him"" (hmm, like kill him?)

If it was just that she lied, I would let this all blow over provided she stfu about declawing her pets. But I don't feel I can overlook this. Thyme has a history of doing things with pets I don't approve of - she once flushed her pet rat down a toilet because it looked sickly. The rat *swam back up.* Turned out it was mostly just dirty.

But to kill a cat because you don't feel like rehoming it, knowing that it could be alive if you hadn't declawed it, and then go on to declaw more cats? I don't think I can overlook that. It's just cruel.

Thyme, Avocado, Books and I have been a very close quartet of friends for about 12 years now. If Thyme decides I'm forgivable (fucking spare me), and I refuse to be her friend anymore over this, it could cause turbulence with the others and make them feel they have to take sides.

It's like bulimia but no binge. I'm 25 and started getting help which was hard because everyone associates throwing up with bulimia (or worse ""bulemia"" and ""bullemia"") and gets dismissive. 

I've been purge free for the first time since I was 10. I hadn't been to a dentist since I was 12. Well obviously, my teeth are fucked. Now when I made the appointment I was clear that it's been a long time since I'd been to a dentist and have an eating disorder, and asked if I could schedule with a kind dentist because it was already scary for me. They said of course, they understand.

When I had the appointment...that's not what happened. The person who started the cleaning and exam was very rough and as soon as she got into it she made this long deep sigh and said ""Let me guess, you're bulimic?""

I started to say ""No, I have purging disorder"" and she cut me off as soon as I said no and said something like ""Please don't lie to me. It's not going to help you or me. We're going to have to (bunch of stuff I don't remember/understand.""

I said ""No, you don't understand. I don't have bulimia, I have--"" she cut me off and said ""It doesn't matter. You have severe enamel erosion, several of your teeth have X and Y.""

I said ""IT'S PURGING DISORDER"" because I thought if I said ""no"" again she would catapult me. 

She said ""Okay, sure, ""purging disorder"""" with air quotes and rolled her eyes.

I'm not proud of it but I started to cry because it was already so anxiety-inducing for me. She got annoyed and took off her gloves, threw them away, and said she would be back when I calmed down. Instead of calming down, I just got my things and left without paying anything. I cried in my car but shook it off and ended up going home. 

When I got home I was still really upset and so I started writing reviews left and right about the situation. I think I left one on like 7 sites. About two weeks later, I got a call. It was someone from that dental practice who had matched my name with my appointment and was wanted to discuss my reviews and how I was obviously very upset, but was leaving those reviews really necessary.

I said yes, it was, to prevent anyone else from having the same humiliating experience. She argued with me that it wasn't going to change anything or fix my teeth. I lied and said that I had already seen another dentist who had managed to treat me with dignity and respect and hung up. On the sites you can reply to reviews, someone responded to me and tried to pretend they worked with me to figure it out.

I've talked about this in my therapy group and with friends. A bunch of people are telling me I'm wrong because 1-star reviews can really hurt small businesses and how it's not their fault they aren't trained better, but I shouldn't take it out on them.

0,"WIBTA if I (24f) reported my (ex) Therapist for unethical behavior? | Over the past few years, I was really struggling with my mental health. I was unmotivated, depressed, extremely anxious, and having bursts of anger. 
So a few months ago, I decided it was finally time to seek outside help. Which brings me to the therapist.

(I have since been diagnosed with ADHD and a mood disorder- not by the therapist)

At the end of my first session with the therapist, I was bothered when they forced me to hug them at the end and said “you’ll get used to it”. I’m not comfortable with physical touch.

I kept going to the sessions bc 1. I wanted to give them a chance and 2. I was finally getting help and did not want to deny myself an opportunity to feel better.

So 2 months go by and I consistently go to my weekly session. Eventually my sessions were only doing the biofeedback, even though I wanted and needed talk therapy. 
They also arrived 15 minutes late to a session (without any notification) AND during my last few sessions, they  spent 10-15 minutes of my time complaining about their own problems.
My copay was $45 per session, so I did not appreciate that. (2months cost me $360)

Here’s the present problem:
I recently started school, and due to requirements, had to change my session time/day.
The last time I saw them (~3 weeks ago) I told them I would like to change days and they responded along the lines of “ I am sure I have another availability, I’ll get back to you on that”. 
A few days later, I text them to see if they looked at the schedule—- no response

The next week I got the confirmation text for the appointment on Tuesday, I immediately texted them to remind them I can’t make it and that I’d still like to find another session time that works. —— no response.

The same thing happened last week, automated call and my text response, asking for their available times—- NO RESPONSE

This week I got no text reminder, which seems like they removed me from their schedule.I text them 1 final time saying I wanted to keep seeing them and to please let me know what availability they have. —— no freaking response

I have still yet to hear from them. 
No discharge summary or reason.
Luckily, I have been on some medicine that has really helped me (thanks to an NP, not the therapist). But I have to be honest, this hurts. Guess you could say I was ghosted by my therapist. 

I really don’t like the idea of putting  someone’s job or livelihood in jeopardy. But I also don’t want anyone else to experience this, especially if they are emotionally or mentally vulnerable.

I also feel like I spent almost $400 for mental health services, that did nothing for me. Again, I am 24 and in school, so budgeting that money for therapy was difficult, but at the time I thought it was a necessary expense. Now I need to find a new provider, which can take months. 

Important notes: 
- I work in providing healthcare services (all I’m comfortable saying), so I am familiar with ethic guidelines and appropriate provider-to-client relationships.

0,"AITA for suggesting that my nephew's bad behaviour is mostly due to parenting to my Brother? | My Nephew has always been a bit of a problem child. He has been Smoking since he was 9 years old, has been expelled from 3 schools. He pretty much stays home and plays on his phone all day and doesn't go to school anymore. He has also had several run ins with the law enforcement for underage driving, drinking, unruly behaviour and so on. He's sixteen years old now and his only friends are other 30 year olds sitting at home and wasting their lives. 

Me and my family recently shifted to our native country, where my nephew lives. His parents, i.e my brother and his wife cannot combat his behaviour at all. My brother left him in my place so that he has no access from his devices and his friends (who are most likely drug users). 

It was incredibly difficult to live with this child the first few days. He's obnoxious, rude and destructive. I put some rules into place, like do your chores(doing his dishes, making bed and doing laundry once a week). The same rules everyone in the family follows. He didn't like it at all. He bullied my kid, tried to burn a blanket, stole my car keys, broke some stuff. He did all this expecting that I'd kick him out. But I didn't. Whenever he broke a rule, we would remove all forms of entertainment and he would get bored and eventually he would do as told. We'd sit him down and explain that actions have consequences. He also earned an allowance by helping me clear the attic(old house) and do some repair work, and compensation would be taken out of that if he broke something. We also prohibited smoking, instead I gave him nicotine gum at regular intervals to prevent withdrawal.

While he was extremely resistant for a while, he eventually gave in and started doing things without being told. He stayed with us for 3 months and there has been a massive change in his attitude. While he is still very rude and obnoxious, he stopped smoking, is not destructive, does his chores and has expressed an interest in going back to school. He also opened up that his Father was always busy, and didn't care if he lived or was dead. He told me that his mother would cart him around therapist to therapist, and whenever they would express that he has a particular disorder she would change doctors. From what I learned, my brother is a workaholic and his mother is heavily into alternative treatments, MLM's, and other things so she's away from home a lot.

When I took him back, I sat them both down and told them that I felt that they both should stay home more and look after their kid. He was very starved for attention and love, and he needed them both. They were extremely offended, and basically banned the kid from talking to me. It's been a few weeks and I have tried to contact him several times but I can't reach him. 

So was I the AH from suggesting that their parenting was to blame, not the kid? I'm worried sick about the kid, he would most definitely break if he sees a cigarette again.",False,False,5,3,2,4,2,4,Care,560
0,"WIBTA if I didn’t let my uncles fam have my dog overnight? | So my (20f) uncle (M) has a girlfriend (S) and two kids (9m, 6f).

Boomer was their dog. They got him as a pup 4 years ago. In the last 3 years, my mom got lots of phone calls of S calling, screaming that M is horribly abusing boomer. Pushing him down stairs, throwing his shit at him, and other unspeakable things. He abused the dog horribly because that’s how he thought dogs should be trained. I know, disgusting.

So about a year ago, I visited and saw boomer was obese. So I started taking him on hikes. He loved it and bonded to me, then started to hate home. S would say things like you should have him but M is super attached to him. After a vet visit they said he had Hypothyroidism, causing him to gain weight and needs to be on a pill for the rest of his life. M thought boomer would never be the same, so he thought about giving him up. It was super hard, as this was his best friend. S was trying hard to get M to give boomer up, because that’s what would have been best for him. Eventually, after lots of emotions and tears, M decided to give him up. In all the emotion, it was said that there would be no problems letting them take boomer for a weekend or something. It wasn’t discussed any further then that. I had no issues with that at the time, as boomer wasn’t mine yet.

The first day I got him I took him to the vet and got the medication he needs. I knocked 60lbs off and In that time he grew a super strong bond to me and my boyfriend. We put a lot of work into making him ours. He’s a different dog.

Yesterday, S texted me asking if they could have Boomer for the weekend after all this stuff going on because their boy is really missing him. I totally don’t feel comfortable with that. Neither does my bf. I don’t trust that he’ll be taken care of properly. I fear he’ll be mistreated. Also when we visit their house, boomer gets visually anxious when we leave because he thinks we’re gonna leave him there. I totally wouldn’t feel right leaving him. It’s not fair to boomer. So I decided to say  “when this is all over I’ll come spend the day and we’ll do fun things” she said “that’s fine but I was thinking the weekend so the kids could spend more then a few hours with him” I said “I mean I can stick around for a while, it would be fair to boomer because he’s really attached to me. Maybe the kids could sleep over here” she responded with “Was that not what we discussed when I first agreed to give him to you that we could still have him for a weekend here and there?”. I haven’t responded. I think I’m gonna stick to my guns. I feel guilty because I told them it would be no problem originally, but things have changed.

TL;DR - Friend smokes in her car all the time, even with her 2 kids (4 & 7) in the vehicle. Cops gives her a ticket for it. I back up the cop. She de-friends me on all social media and refuses to talk to me and now 2 friends tell me I should have just agreed with her to make her happy.

LONG VERSION - She's a smoker and she smokes with her 2 children in her car, in the back seats. She got pulled over by a police officer and got a ticket for smoking while her children were in the vehicle. She was complaining to me about it saying she had all her windows down and how she is going to fight it or not even pay it. as well Saying the cop called her all these nasty names and shes also going to file a complaint. Her argument was they have no right to tell her how to raise her children and she's been doing it for years & sees others do it and feels singled out cause she is black & had it been me I wouldn't have been given a ticket. (I'm white)

ME: I couldn't defend her actions and told her that I'm all for what a person can and can not do with their own body but if it ever endangers another person (of any age) that's a TOTALLY different story. I feel she is endangering the life of her children by doing this. Second hand smoke has been proven to be deadly. As far as filing the complaint about the officer, I told her if she feels what he said was inappropriate, then to of course file a complaint at the department HQ ask them to review his bodycam, (By her demeanor and the way she's playing herself out to be the victim, I honestly don't believe the cop called her nasty names BUT I never said this because that wouldn't have been productive in the slightest). She called me a bad friend for not being there for her and she thought I hated cops as much as she did... I told her I have NEVER said I hate cops. I hate BAD cops, and have no problem with the majority of Police Officers. After 45 minutes of me trying to explain to her that even though they ARE her children, when she is putting their health in danger by smoking with them in the car, I can't back her whole ""Fuck the police"" rant because I believe what the officer did was right because by her own volition she admitted to doing it ""ALL THE TIME"".

0,"AITA for disciplining and shoving an aggressive dog in a public space? | I look after a 9 year-old girl from time to time with severe birth defects to her legs and spine. She is forced to use a wheelchair every day... lets call her Lacy. I am a family friend, and not an official caregiver, but i've been taking her out for walks and ice cream on Saturdays while her siblings are at camp on the west coast and her parents work their business. 

She does great, and i rarely need to help her along the pathways or off the curbs when we are out and about. However, often we will walk through public parks and she is scared of dogs... but is completely fine if they are on a lead and the owners are present to restrain them.

On this Saturday we were lined up outside of a very popular ice cream shop. It was extremely busy and has an outdoor service window so people can order outside instead of going in. We were lined up with a bunch of people who had dogs and Lacy was fine. However, a few minutes later someone lined up behind us, the girl that ended up behind us had a very aggressive terrier. I am not at all bothered by dogs, well behaved or not... but I could tell Lacy was getting anxious and her hands were getting sweaty. For some reason the dog was taking a special interest in the wheelchair, and not a pleasant one. He kept barking incessantly at Lacy and grabbed a hold of my jeans with his teeth when i stepped between him and Lacy as a barrier. He was gnawing away at the wheels and i would gently brush him off. Lacy was actively trying to move away from the dog, but as she moved up, the girl behind us moved up too, while still paying absolutely zero attention to the dogs behaviour and chatting to her friend.

Eventually I tried to get the girls attention, as she was deep in conversation and clearly used to tuning out the barking and growling. Instead of looking at me when i said ""excuse me..."", she just held up a finger, as if to say ""one second"", and then proceeded to keep on talking. It was such a rude gesture that my ears actually burned with fury. I pushed Lacy up a bit further and then the guys in front of us asked us ""is that dog bothering her?"" and just as i was about to answer the terrier jumped up and nipped at Lacys fingers and she screamed. Reflexively I swung around and grabbed the dog by its abdomen as it was just about to jump and pushed it away, probably a little more aggressively than i should have  (it fell over).... while nearly spluttering

“NO!!! SIT!!!”

The dog immediately sat. and whined... Nearly everyone in line stopped talking and watched.

0,"AITA for cancelling my New Years Eve dinner with my boyfriend? | So my boyfriend and I have been together for four years. We obviously planned to do New Years together. We’re kind of at the age we don’t really party as hard anymore, so we just planned on having a nice dinner and maybe walking past the area they do the fireworks when we are done. There wasn’t a particular restaurant either of us were dying to go to, so I left it to him to make reservations somewhere. He asked me to dress for fine dining. 

Now, through out the holidays my sister has been very sick in the hospital. She has been battling cancer and it’s metastasized into her brain. It entered into her brain fluid and essentially became something “incurable but treatable.” It has been absolutely **devastating** for our entire family. I’ve been not going to work as frequently and barely have it in me to be social with anyone. 

I spent Christmas Eve, Christmas, and basically almost every day in between in the hospital with her. I’ve started to feel bad and apologetic because I know my boyfriend wants to spend this time with me, but to me I need to prioritize my sister. 

Yesterday I found out my sister supposedly has “a few days to less than a few weeks to live.” I’ve never been more heartbroken in my entire life. I want to spend all my time with her, but I also don’t want to make my boyfriend feel unimportant or leave him in a situation where he has to be alone on holidays. You may ask why he can’t come to the hospital with me, but my sister specifically requested not to see any non-family members. 

The hospital has asked that my sister always has someone with her, so we arrange our schedules something like this: my parents stay with her for a long majority of the morning, some relatives/my other sister and I will come in through out the afternoon or when we are off work, and her husband comes at night to stay the night with her. 

Today, on New Year’s Eve, my family would like me to go around 5-6. My boyfriend made a reservation for us at 8:30. I wanted to try to do both, but the hospital is an almost an hour away from where we are supposed to be going. I don’t see how I can make it for the dinner. 

I feel like I am abandoning my boyfriend on New Year’s Eve. Has has no other plans and it’s too late for him to do something else with someone else. 

He has never made me feel bad about it. He understands that this is my family and it’s important. But just because he says that, doesn’t mean he isn’t disappointed, and I know *I* feel bad. Certainly I can leave the hospital later and him and I can just do nothing and stay in at home... but then I’m worried if I’ll even be able to get a cab home from the hospital.

0,"AITA for refusing to allow my mom to see my baby after she was thrilled that I couldn't get an epidural? | I (19) gave birth to a baby girl two weeks ago. The pregnancy was unplanned, and very very stressful. I have had an eating disorder in the past, so getting so much bigger was a huge stress for me. I'm also only 4'11, and weighed around 95lbs for half of my pregnancy, so it was also very hard on my body. Pregnancy was not really an enjoyable experience for me for a bunch of reasons, so I was determined to try and make the birth as smooth as possible. I started my birth plan at around 7 months, and was adamant I wanted an epidural. 

I moved back in with my mom when I was 6 months gone because of the health issues around my pregnancy, as my boyfriend works 8-5 and I was on bed rest for a long time. My mom helped with my birth plan, and continuously said that I shouldn't have an epidural, that I should experience birth, if I don't have a natural birth with anything but gas and air that I'm not a 'real' mother, that young girls always cop out, etc. She was also judging me for my parenting choices (such as wanting cloth diapers and wanting to try EC). I was sick of hearing it and told her that I would be doing what I wanted, and that if she was so insistent I couldn't have an epidural then she couldn't be in the room when I gave birth. This conversation happened almost every day, until I went into labour at 35 weeks. 

I had to have an emergency c-section. It was traumatic and painful, and I don't remember much of my daughter's birth. I'm having a really hard time coming to terms with this, and I really do feel like the universe is telling me I shouldn't be a mother because of the pregnancy issues and the birth.

I stuck to my word and my mother wasn't allowed in the room with me until the day after the birth. She came in upset, and when she held my daughter the first thing she said was 'ah, she's gorgeous. I'm so glad you get to feel the birth now because you didn't get to do it naturally'. She gestured to my c-section wound. I was furious, demanded my boyfriend take the baby from my mother, and asked her to leave. She cried and said she was joking, I said she needs to go and I need time to consider whether I want her in my life at the moment considering she obviously has no respect for me. 

This was two weeks ago. She hasn't tried to contact me, but my dad has and he says I need to forgive mom despite her not apologising.

0,"WIBTA if I had my frozen sperm destroyed? | So I (28m) have been having a lot of discussions/fights with my girlfriend (29f) lately. I will have to give you some background information for this to make sense.

Roughly 2 years ago I was diagnosed with brain cancer. They also found metastasis from the tumor all the way down my spine. I went through chemotherapy and radiation as a result. One possible side effect of the treatment was that I would become infertile. So I had my sperm frozen before the treatment just to be on the safe side and I really did become infertile. 

The problem is that I don't want to have biological children. I also suffer from major depression and my early 20s were absolutely awful as a result. It took me several years just to become a functioning member of society and I still go to therapy and take antidepressants to this day. There's also a history of depression in my family. My mom and my uncle have also been diagnosed with depression and they think that my grandmother also suffered from it.

Because of that I decided that I don't want to have biological children. I just don't want to see my children go through the same problem as I did. I know that wouldn't necessarily happen, but I don't want to take any chances. A large part of my life has been absolutely awful because of depression to the point where I was seriously thinking about taking my own lifefor many years.

Recently my girlfriend and I have been talking a lot about having children. I absolutely love her and definitely want to marry her and start a family with her, but I don't want to have biological children. I would be okay with either a sperm donor or adoption. She doesn't want either of these options though and definitely wants me to be the biological father of her children.

She says that just because depression has been a problem in my family that that doesn't mean my children will suffer from it, too. And while that is true I still don't want to take a chance. The thing is she never knew me when I my depression was really bad. We've known each other for three years and have been together for two years now.

A few days ago I mentioned that I'm thinking about getting rid of my frozen sperm. She immediately started crying and begged me to keep it. I 100% made up my mind on this topic though. I'm not going to have biological children with anyone. I think it's irresponsible and I couldn't live with myself if my children had to go through the same struggles as I did. I just don't see any reason why I should keep my sperm. It costs me ~300€ a year to keep it frozen. (It's frozen at - 196° C.)

I’m 30 years old and have some pretty serious health conditions. 
Until April I was going to my grandparents house every day from 9am until 7pm to care for them both. In April we moved in with my in laws whilst we waited to find a new home, as they lived further away and I don’t drive I then went 3-4 times a week for at least 3 hours at a time. I’ve been caring for them for years now. 

In June my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer and on Thursday we were told it was time for him to go into the hospice, however they had no space.
I went on Thursday until 9pm when I had to leave to sort my dogs out, I then went back Friday afternoon and have been there ever since. Helping care for grandad, cleaning the house ect. 
My grandad passed away on Sunday afternoon and my grandmas back pain was suddenly worse so she’s now bed ridden and can’t sit up at all. 

My uncle has gone on holiday he left the morning after my grandad passed and my father won’t do any actual care for grandma (cleaning her up, helping her use the bedpan as she can’t get up to the toilet). 

Since Sunday I’ve done everything alone, grandma has you up stairs every 5 minutes, she won’t let you stay upstairs but then demands you back to feed her, give her drinks, help her use the bedpan, keep her company, change the sheets ect. I’ve also been doing all the housework and I’m exhausted. 

My uncles wife has arrived and taken over but she lives 5 hours away and can’t stay indefinitely because she has children. 

We are currently waiting for the X-ray to verify but the doctor said he thinks it’s a crushed vertebrae and it’s likely to be months before she can sit up. 

I’ve been asked to return and stay. But I am honestly at my breaking point. I’m already a carer for my husband who has Aspergers I have 5 dogs and am due to move in 2 weeks. As well as my own serious health issues and mental health issues.

My girlfriend (then fiancée) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

Now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that I’ve never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. She left me with my grandma and I was raised by her since birth. I have always and will always consider my grandma my real “mother”  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

About a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn’t have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer’s help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

Fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma’s condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. My uncles and I immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

She doesn’t pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. I called my fiancée multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. Not only was I not in the best state of mind (again, she’s my mother to me) but I needed to be by her side when she passed. I felt sick at the idea of not being there when I could.

My fiancée was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted I get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and I understand that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in me being there since she won’t even know I’m there due to her dementia. I understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn’t matter if she realised I was there or not. I just felt I had to be there with my uncles. 

She ended up passing the night of my wedding. My fiancée didn’t talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. She said I was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as my fiancée she should take top priority no matter what. My opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.

0,"WIBTA if I called my sister out for being a terrible mom/person? | Some backstory: my sister (31F) has a baby at 19 to try and save a failing relationship. Big shocker, it didn’t work. Baby comes, dad sticks it out for a while then moves back home to Ohio (were in PA). Sister does the whole single mom thing for a bit, but meets a guy and decides she’d rather go out and party every night with him then spend time home with a kid so she gives full custody of my nephew to his dad around his second birthday. (Luckily dad stepped up and my nephew is a happy healthy adorable 10 year old).

Cut to 2 years ago and my sister announces she’s pregnant. She tells everyone how happy she is and how she can’t wait to be “a real mom” and that this is going to be her “second chance” baby. 

The baby is born and for a while she seems to be doing well, she was working hard and focused on raising her son. Now he’s 2, and a bit of a handful (as all toddlers are) and her temper with him has been getting shorter and shorter. She constantly snaps at him or will come home from work and put him right to bed so that she doesn’t have to deal with him. She also has started seeing someone. This guy lives in Pittsburgh (nowhere near where we live) and she has been driving out to see him more and more often. When she goes out there she leaves my nephew at his babysitters for days at a time without telling anyone where he is until after the fact. 

I think it’s incredibly dangerous for her to be leaving him with someone who doesn’t have any of our contact information and no one in my family even knows her name let alone how to get ahold of her in case of an emergency. We’ve all said something to her but of course she just rolls her eyes and ignores everyone.

She just got back from a 4 day trip to Pittsburgh where my nephew spent the whole time at his babysitters (unbeknownst to us- she swore he was with her until she got home an hour ago and admitted he was at the sitters) and then texted me and my sister about plans for her birthday next weekend where she intends to send the baby to the sitter for another 3 days.

0,"AITA for checking on my elderly neighbor? | I live in an apartment building with my girlfriend and I have a neighbor across the hall that I'm friendly with.  

I dont really know her that well but we do say hi when we see each other.
One thing I do know about her is that she has a son (late 40's?) and a granddaughter (14?) who seems very intelligent just based off having small conversations with her when she sees me with my dog.
The son, however, has given me and my girlfriend weird vibes.  I've never spoken to him but I did hear him tell his mom to shut the fuck up one time.

Anyways, here's what happened last night.  It was around 11 pm and I heard a bunch of loud bangs.  Like heavy enough that it woke my gf up.  No sound came after so I chalked it up to someone falling in their apartment.
5 minutes later I hear another big bang and a quick scream.  I go outside in the hallway to listen and I hear nothing so I walk up to the level above and listen and nothing.  All of a sudden some arguing starts up from somewhere on my floor so I go down to my floor and listen and  I hear another loud bang and I hear my neighbor telling someone to please calm down.
I didnt even think and I knocked on her door.  She answers hiding behind the door and I asked if she was ok and she said yes but it seemed odd. All of a sudden the son comes running to the door laughing saying everything is ok blah blah but I didnt buy it and I cut him off without even looking at him and asked her again "" are you sure you're ok?"" And she said yes once again.
Now I'm in just my boxers, I'm a big guy (6'3, 240 lbs) and I have a lot of tattoos on my arms and torso so I was TRYING to be as intimidating as possible when I looked her in the eyes and said "" if you have any problems, I'm here"" and then I went back to my apartment.

So at this point, I pretty much assume this guy has/is abusing his mom or granddaughter.
Fast forward to today and my neighbor knocked on my door to explain that her son and granddaughter were playing fighting etc and the story makes complete sense   I apologize for being nosey and she said thank you for being a good neighbor.

So, I'm a classic worry wart so I'm now stressing out because I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world for just assuming and labeling this guy has an abuser but my neighbor and girlfriend think I did the right thing.

I have to wake up at 5:30 am to leave by 7 am to be at work at 8 am thank to heavy traffic. Boyfriend is up at 8 to be at school at 9 (we live close to his school). I get home at 5:30 pm. He's almost always home already (I'm not sure what time he gets there, but he only has a couple classes a day). 

Oftentimes when I get home he's playing video games. And spends a good portion of the night playing, with a break to eat with me, sometimes do the dishes, and maybe some studying. I don't care that he plays video games. And I don't care how much he plays video games. 

My problem is that he plays multi-player team games with internet friends of his. And it gets LOUD.

He has noise-cancelling headphones and probably doesn't realize how loud he's being, but also doesn't believe me when I tell him he's being loud. He shouts orders. He does voices and characters. He gets frustrated and curses and slams his fists down in frustration.

Every night for hoooooooooours. I can't deal with it. I've asked him, I've pleaded with him to be quiet. He gets mad and says he's not being loud and he has a right to be loud in his own home. Do I not have the right to some peace and quiet when I get home after a long day at work and a horrible commute?

Even worse is bedtime. I would need to be asleep by 9:30 to get enough sleep, and it takes me an hour to fall asleep. That's not gonna happen. But some nights it would be nice to go to bed at 9:30. For the first few weeks of this job I went to bed at 10:30 and I'm realizing that's not sustainable for me in the long run (since I'm not really asleep until 11:30 and then I only get max 6 hours of sleep).

He's completely unsympathetic to this. If I get in bed at 10:30 I have to beg him to be quiet. The few nights I've tried going to bed earlier than that he's gotten upset with me for going to bed earlier than ""my bedtime"". 

I really don't think it's fair. I'm here with this commute on this schedule so that he can try to achieve his dream while I work in a job I don't really like and am not good at and gives me anxiety to help support that.

0,"WIBTA: Not returning a runaway animal to someone I suspect will kill it? | Obligatory throw-away account. 

So here's the setup, I live out in the sticks. Everyone has a few acres, tons of woods, wildlife galore, the works. My neighbors and I all share one long road as a driveway with houses jutting off every quarter mile or so. 

One of my neighbors I suspect is a poacher. He has deer feeders set up in his woods, salt licks and artificial water holes, all overseen by deer blinds and hunting positions in the trees. And every now and then you hear a gunshot and sometime later a car goes by with a fresh deer or some other animal mounted. And this happens at all times of the year, not just hunting season. And he's really adamant people stay out of his woods.

Now this happened a few days ago. It was a roasting hot 99, with a heat index in the triple digits. My two dogs start barking and are crowded around my front door, looking through the window. So I think maybe mailman or something. I open the door and Boom! A white rabbit hops in. My dogs immediately start to sniff it, but it completely ignores them, hops right past me to a water bowl a few feet away and starts to drink. After its had its fill it plops on the ground, panting, obviously close to overheating. My dogs just lay down right next to it as if he's a long lost litter mate. I go over and i notice the rabbit has a tag on his ear that just says ""17"". 

I suspect this little guy was either bred to be hunted for sport, or is bait for a fox/owl/something that people pay to release and then hunt the predator. And the suspected poacher lives a good 2 miles down the road. I suspect this little guy escaped, survived the trek to my house in the scorching heat and choose my house as a safe place. 

My neighbor has not put up any missing signs, or called or anything. I called my two nearest neighbors(poacher is about 4 houses down) and neither had a missing rabbit, and both agree likely its animal bait. 

My dogs love the rabbit, its very friendly and I'm seriously considering just adopting it. My aunt is a vet, so I can have the tag removed and get information on rabbits and just pretend I bought him legally. I would feel terrible going to check if he is in fact the suspected poacher and returning the poor thing, knowing he'd likely die.

He is an alcoholic,  addicted to drugs and was violent towards my mother when they were together. 

There were also some other aligations I can't say as they weren't proven,  and neither me or my sisters were old enough to remember anyway.  

After my parents split,  my father stayed in the house forcing my mother into emergency housing with us.  My mother would pay him to be in our lives be it taking care of us for a weekend or taking us out somewhere.  And when he took care of himself he would leave me as a 5-7 year old in charge of my 2 younger sisters.  Sometimes he would leave us with a babysitter while he went to the pub,  and we were frequently left around family for a few hours here and there or just left in the house with a friend we wouldn't know to watch over us. 

He would make empty promises and never follow through,  he would yell at me for things he was told off for when taking care of us and it was overall not a nice environment.  He has never payed a penny towards us unless made to by his partner for Christmas gifts.  

When I was 8 my mother blocked contact with him due to a court ruling he cannot be left alone with us while we are under 16 until he has gone through family therapy with us. 

Since I was 8 he has made little effort to be in our lives and the only times have been when encouraged to by his partner,  which he never went the legal route. 

He doesn't send birthday cards and does Christmas if he remembers,  of which he sends presents that his partner has bought to my uncle who gives them to us.  Any birthday cards he have had someone else has bought and he just signed it.

Two weeks before graduating from grad school, I found out I was pregnant even though we took every precaution. I told my boyfriend. He told me he was fine with it. He is about four years older and felt he was ready to have a baby. For about two months, he treated me like crap. Despite telling me that he wanted to keep the baby, he pressured me multiple times to terminate the pregnancy by questioning my parenting skills. He was also growing distant.I cried myself to sleep most nights. He eventually gave me an ultimatum - either keep the baby and leave him or stay with him but end the pregnancy. I decided to go with the former and moved out.After grad school, I started working as a Systems engineer so I was able to financially provide for myself. I never asked him for a penny.  

During the four months we were apart, his brother and best friend would email, text and call me to tell me to terminate the pregnancy. I also found out that he had cheated on me with an ex of his during the last 6 months of our relationship. I ended up changing my number and deactivating social media and my personal email accounts.

I think he's a legitimate phychopath, which is why he has been through 28 homes. I find him very creepy with how he studies things, the types of questions he asks and how he treats those he thinks are weaker than him. His behavior is often disturbing. 

I am in my 30's and live 1800km away.  They are visiting my little family for a few days and I have watched him allow my 1 year old to climb up his legs to stand and then kick him down. I've watched him taunt the dog with a toy, and when my dog finally got the toy, he slapped her quite hard a cross the face and called her a bad dog. He actively terrorizes the cat (who recently had hip surgery) and thinks it's funny when she tries to run away from him, but she can't because she's hurt.

This question comes up several times a day and each time I say that she had cancer, but I don't think that's the type of answer he's looking for.

I [23M] have something of a hefty backstory. My bio father left my mum while she was pregnant and idek who he is. She remarried when I was 3 to my stepfather and had my first sister a year later. Stepfather had always been cold towards me, but when his own kid was born, he basically decided he didn't want to raise someone else's child too and I got put into care. I was in and out of the care system (mostly in it) until I was 15, when I was graciously allowed back into my family home because I was grown up enough now that he wouldn't have to deal with me. 

Now, my time in care was awful. I'm sure you've all heard the horror stories about what hapems to kids in the system sometimes, and that I don't need to go into too much detail. Any time I saw my mum I would beg her to come home but he just simply wouldn't allow it. I grew a really intense feeling of resentment towards my stepfather, and I still have it because honestly, fuck him for making me go through that. 

Now the man is sick. It could be terminal, but he's receiving treatment so potentially not. Mum wants me to make ammends with him, just in case, but I've no interest in that. I've told her as much, and told her why. She keeps telling me to ""see his side"", like that makes it any better. He shoved me into the system because he's too proud to raise another man's child? What kind of a justification is that? Mum keeps talking about how difficult it was for him to have a child with a disability, which he does as my second sister has Down's syndrome, but that's also a bs justification because: 1. I'd already been in the system for *four years* when she was born and 2. Her intellectual disability/developmental delay is really mild and she's honestly more or less on the same level as other kids her age and always has been, so it isn't like she has really difficult to cater to special needs. He's tried using the ""problem child"" excuse, and while it's true I acted out as a teenager, I believe that was a result of being in the system, not vice versa.

My mom's been abused basically her entire life, including by my dad, and when I was seven my dad started to threaten her with death if she didn't divorce him and move back to the US. He took all of our money so she didn't finish the divorce entirely as we had to flee to live with her parents before we were totally broke. My dad accused her of kidnapping (even though he knew we were leaving), dragged her through US federal and circuit courts, and she was acquitted and got custody. However, he also received mandatory visitation, mandatory phone calls/contact, had to pay no alimony or settlements, and only pays minimal child support ($300/month).

As I've grown up, he and his family have continually denied that any of the abuse happened. His entire extended family insists my mom poisoned me and lied to me even though I witnessed and remember this abuse. However, aside from this, they do try to be good family, paying for flights to visit them, buying me clothes, etc, but their denial of these events really bothers me. Besides, even with a generous estimate of how much they pay (including child support) the amount they contribute still doesn't really cover the cost of raising a child, which my mom's parents have pretty much covered while my mom has been trying to recover from her trauma and find a stable job. My dad and his new wife on the other hand are very well-off, spending a lot of money on private school and expensive clothes for his other kids.

Now, I got into my dream school, and my dad is insisting that if he pays for my college (asking for $15,000 for the first year, even less after that if I become an RA and get the scholarships I applied for), I have to visit with him and his family more and start to distance myself from my mother, which is a non-negotiable for me.

Anxiety and a PTSD response to this situation (plus a difficult birth), juggling this plus having a toddler at home, and living an hour from the hospital - I’ve been hanging on by a thread.  After a near-mental breakdown, I accepted I need more help, and reluctantly took my MIL up on her offer to fly out from across the country to stay with us for a while to help us with the house and the toddler while my husband works and I attend to our preemie in the NICU. 

She showed up yesterday coughing, sneezing, and with watery, runny eyes. She’s well aware that I have been extremely paranoid about germs and transmitting illnesses to the NICU, or, getting sick myself and not being able to see my baby.  She didn’t give us any warning she was sick.  She said that she started feeling sick a few days before her flight.  Had she let us know she was sick, we’d have had her change her flight to a week later so there was no risk of contagion (she bought a ticket that could be changed without a fee, and she was planning on staying the rest of the month).

The NICU team said that it might be okay if she wore a mask and was extremely careful about sanitizing, but it was still a risk.  With my mental health already hanging on by a thread, this is just an added stressor I can’t bear.   My husband was more on board with having her just be really careful with washing her hands, but I’ve already been seeing her coughing on things, not washing hands after blowing her nose, etc. I can’t follow her around constantly to be sure she’s following good sanitary practices. 

My husband was reluctant, but we sat her down, and explained that we really appreciated her coming, but explained exactly why it’s so risky for us or our baby to get sick right now.

I have a one month old daughter and a boyfriend. My boyfriend has not been able to find a job for several months and we’ve struggled financially in the past even when he had a job. When I go back to work after my maternity leave we wouldn’t be able to afford daycare, but I make too much to qualify for any government aid. Because of this situation MIL had offered to watch the baby in our apartment for a small amount of money so we could work and not be in an even worse financial situation. I had even turned down a spot on a list at a daycare because we had agreed to have her watch our baby in our own apartment. 

Now that it’s getting closer for me to go back, she came back to us and told us she would not watch the baby in our apartment. Instead she wanted to watch the baby in her apartment instead. She gave valid reasons as to why she didn’t want to come to ours anymore to watch her (the distance driving, being away from home all the time, etc) and i understand her feelings about it because she was doing us a giant favor. It was a lot to ask of someone especially since we would’ve been paying her very little. 

The issue with this arrangement comes from the fact that she lives in a very bad neighborhood. We have had packages stolen from her house, people have broken into their cars and stolen electronics, etc. There have also been complaints about people coming up to their apartment constantly asking them for things as well as when someone has broken in before. It’s a horrible environment. My boyfriend and I both pray that they would be able to live someone safer, but it doesn’t seem like it will happen any time soon. 

After some talking, we decided that my boyfriend would be a SAHD instead of having MIL watch the baby in that neighborhood. We were both too concerned that something horrible would happen (as patterns tend to suggest it would). MIL seemed to accept the decisión rather well, but didn’t want to accept that we didn’t want our baby there for safety reasons.

Then Tina was born around the time I was 10 years old, from then on I was basically a live in babysitter for Tina. 

Over the years Tina grow to treat me like her mother because I took care of her, made sure she was fed, did the grocery shopping and tired to keep the house clean.

After my injury, the first thing he asked me was if I wished I were dead. I honestly don't really remember what I said, and then after that, he asked a lot of very personal questions about things. About what still works and what doesn't. It felt really weird as I was 13 at the time and I didn't really want to think about those things with him. He's been a bit odd about everything for the past year and gets really defensive when I ask him if he could stop asking such personal questions. 

Last week in English Class, we were having a class discussion about euthanasia. He not so subtly implied that people like me should be euthanized to save taxpayers money (basically said how disabled people are a waste of resources, it was quite rude) and I started getting a bit emotional and had to leave the room to collect myself. My English teacher is actually really nice and asked to speak to me after class and asked if I was alright and then spoke some words of encouragement. At that point, I completely broke down and told her about how my friend had repeatedly made me uncomfortable and I explained everything. 

Yesterday I got a text from him saying that what I did was 'super not cool' and a few of his friends confronted me and asked why I got so mad about a joke.

Anyway, my dads birthday was the other day. He asked if I could make him a cake, so I did. But, of course, it was gluten free. I love my dad but I’m not going to make myself sick by baking with wheat flour, it’s not worth it. They can be kind of weird about gluten free stuff, acting like it’s poison or something. Sometimes if they know something is gluten free, they’ll instantly act like they don’t like it, or try it and say that it’s gross. Which is why I don’t really cook/bake for them anymore. My dad is the only one who doesn’t act like that, so that’s the only reason I even tried making a cake. 

Because of this, I didn’t tell my family the cake was gluten free. They all ate it and loved it, didn’t say anything about it being gross. Later that night my mom found the package for the gluten free flour in the garbage. She asked if I had used it for the cake and I said yes. She immediately told the rest of the family, and they’re all really mad at me for “forcing” my diet on them. They said they thought I had grown up by now, and wasn’t doing that anymore. I find this very irritating, especially since only my parents ate the cake! Obviously we can’t have a party right now, so this was just something for the three of us. But now everyone is angry because I hypothetically gave them gluten free food?? The only person who’s taking my side is my dad.

0,"WIBTA for letting my 3yo nephew go into foster care? | Quick back story: The child’s mother (my wife’s sister) is addicted to meth and is a prostitute and the father has been ghost his entire life. The mother abandoned him and left him with their other sister whom she was living with at the time. The other sister eventually got fed up with the situation and basically told my wife that either we can take him or she will call CPS and let them handle it. This took place in Arizona which has a notoriously bad foster care system which usually ends up in abuse, so we couldn’t let that happen. We decided to take him for the time being.

Fast forward to now, my wife and I are at our wits end. We have 3 children of our own that we are struggling to provide for, we are currently co-living with my Mom and splitting rent/bills because we are not financially secure. My nephew was also born addicted to methadone and we’ve noticed some potential development issues coming to the surface. He can’t speak very well for his age, he doesn’t understand potty training, very destructive, whiny and just very difficult in general. I’ve seen my wife break down several times and cry because she just isn’t equipped to deal with it. It’s also taking a toll on my kids who have started to resent him, even though they may be picking that up from me and their mother. We love him, we want the best for him, but I don’t think we can provide it for him.  We don’t want to be angry with him or take out our frustrations on him because none of this is his fault, but we can’t do this anymore. We decided that we would look into other options, but there is nobody else in the family that can or will take him. The parents are MIA and the other sister said no because she needs to put her family first, which I understand. So this leaves us with the option of getting the state involved and letting him go into the system (in Texas). Just the thought of this makes me sick to my stomach and I don’t know if I could live with the guilt. But I also know that we can’t live like this any longer.

Six years ago I finally reached a point where I could try to have a relationship with my older sister (18 months age gap) we are both adults now and hadn't seen each other for five years at that point.  I agreed to go to a restraunt for a meal with extended family members that my sister would be attending.

When I accepted the invitation I reminded everyone that I have a severe allergy to [unusual and possibly identifying food item] and that i could not sit next to anyone eating [food item].  My sister takes a bite of her burger, says ""this has [food item] in it"" then leans across the table and breathes on my face.

I walked out, took Benadryl and called my boyfriend to pick me up.

My therapist was stunned into silence when I told her.

My family backed me up at the time when I said I was done with her.

0,"AITA for quietly wishing my mom would pass away sooner rather than later? | Let me preface by saying: I love my mom. Very much. This is not out of hate, but more coming from a place of I guess... selfishness.
(Throw away for obvious reasons)

My mom has dementia. She is completely losing it. Can't complete simple tasks, starting to shit herself, is almost a 10-second-Tom. She has no idea how old I am (25F, youngest of 4) or where I live, etc. 

In addition to the dementia she has severe scoliosis that has been endangering her organs for the past few years, emphysema while she continues to smoke who knows how many cigarettes a day (often having two lit at once b/c she forgets she's smoking one), and some other health issues.

She lives with my dad about an hour away. My dad still works full time, two days a week from home. She is driving him nuts and he is so stressed out. She constantly accuses him of stealing her stuff (like candles or her slippers) - something that is common with people with dementia. She refuses to sleep or eat a lot of the time, magnifying her symptoms. She forgets when family visit or when my dad takes her out (probably 6 days a week) and then gets mad no one takes her anywhere. I'm aware it is all part of the dementia, but it makes things so hard.

I want to move out of state and I won't do it while she is still alive. I'm also worried I'm going to lose my dad before my mom because he is under so much stress. He has high blood pressure and diabetes. The pain I, snd the rest of my family, have from seeing my mom like this is almost unbearable. It's not the woman I remember raising me, and in fact I'm starting to forget how she once was. 

I've been thinking it would be better if she just passed away sooner rather than later. God I feel horrible even typing this... but I don't want to see her suffer like this anymore and I don't want to see my dad suffer from it either.

Wife and I have been married for 25 years, and wife's drinking has progressively gotten worse over the years.  Their father is an non-drinking (now) alcoholic - been on the wagon for pretty much 3-4 decades.

I mentioned my wife's drinking 10 years ago to BIL and wife went ballistic. But since then her drinking just keeps getting worse.  In fact, in the past few months she's fallen down (gave herself two black eyes in the process), and been so drunk on two occasions she lost control of bodily functions (once pee one diarrhea) walking down the hall (thankfully we have hardwood floors)  to the bathroom, not realizing what she had done and I eventually accidentally stepped in them.  She passes out on a nightly basis and she goes through at least 6 bottles of wine, a 1.75L or Vodka,  and a 1.75L of Rum each week.

We saw my BIL at Christmas when my wife was recovering from her black eyes (still QUITE visible) and BIL asked what happened and she stated she tripped on a cushioned mat in our kitchen.  BIL knows that I would never lay a finger on my wife, in fact her family jokes if they got a call that there was domestic violence at our house, they would ask if I was OK.

I am at the end of my rope, I have tried talking to my wife and after 'an event' she stops drinking for a week or two, before going off the edge again.

My wife was black. I am white. She passed away 6 years ago after a drunk driver ran a stoplight. 

When we were together, her father cut her out of his life because she married me. He called me names, but the real problem was the names he called her, incredibly hurtful and demeaning and reduced her to nothing in his mind but a slave master loving traitor. 

He made it clear she was no longer his child. When our daughter was born, he sent an angry flurry of Facebook messages to my wife and called our daughter names I don’t want to repeat and only calmed down after he received an extreme backlash from his community when his posts gained notoriety. 

When she died, he didn’t even bother showing up to the funeral despite me reaching out via various platforms to try and reach him. 

My beautiful daughter is 11 years old now. My wife always made it clear how important it was that my daughter had a sense of black identity, and I have done everything I can do instil that in her.

1,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to leave a concert early? | My Background : I am a police officer and used to work in a very active jail dealing with junkies. I am also very much in love with my girlfriend and have talked about marriage. 

Background of the issue : My girlfriend and her friend (two females) went to a concert which I have no issue with. I work crazy hours and don’t get to spend as much time with my friends/family,  so I’m perfectly ok with her hanging out with her friends. 


The problem: A few days before the concert she told me that her friend would be the designated driver. One of the first post to her Snapchat was them both with large mixed drinks. This is where I start worrying, my girlfriend says that there is hardly an alcohol in the drinks, that they are over priced, and that her and her friend would be leaving soon. This was around 7pm. Around 8:30-9:00pm she is still posting snapchats about the concert so I ask about it and she says that another performance came on. Then she tells me there is cocaine at the concert. Now I’m maximum worry, as the experience from the job tells me where this cocaine there normally follows other drugs. Not to mention having fought with junkies, I know I personally would not like to be in a situation where people are snorting coke around me as it can be very dangerous. I am also aware that there is only two of them and worried as my girlfriend told me she had been roofied a few years ago. I ask her to leave the concert for her safety. She then tells me if I want to her hide in the bathroom so she can miss the show, I tell her that I don’t want her to separate from her friend and that I’m very much worried for both of them.  She then calls me and says that I need to chill out, and I’m over reacting. At this point she had been rude with me and I told she was being disrespectful.  I never called her any names and was trying to tell that I trusted her, but it was the other people using drugs/selling drugs that I was worried about. She ended up staying the full time, then called me. She called me a dick for asking her to leave and ruining her night. I explained to her that I was on duty and need to focus and would like to talk to her about the issue at a better time but she kept trying to push the issue. I just asked her to let me know when she got home safely and has now ignored me. The time is now 3:30am where I am and I have not heard from her since she left.  I am still extremely worried about her as I have no idea she made it home.  She also stated to that she wouldn’t tell me about it next time and that had she not told me about the drugs she would have a great night. I am not sure if her silence is her being vindictive... 


TLDR: girlfriend went to concert, said she would leave at 7, stayed till 9ish, said there was cocaine, I asked to her leave because of the danger, she stayed till the end, then tried to start an argument while I was at work, I asked to table it till a better time, she didn’t want to, I asked to let me know when she got home,  no reply back.

My daughter is 16 and I am 31. My big sister has always been helpful with my daughter. They are very close. She doesn’t have or want children of her own. 

I fell on hard times when my daughter was around 12. I was essentially homeless after losing a job and breaking up with my boyfriend. She went to stay with my sister as I figured out what I was going to do. She stayed with her for a year or so. When she came back to me, she began having behavior problems. She felt more comfortable talking things out with my sister so I let her. 

This Wednesday the hospital called me and said that my daughter was in the ER. Some “friends” of my daughters had dropped her off, high, in my sisters front yard. She was unresponsive, so sister called an ambulance. My sister called me and filled me in. I didn’t even know that my daughter was using drugs. 

I talked with my sister as soon as I got to the hospital, and asked her what happened. She told me that she knew about my daughter experimenting with drugs, but she didn’t think that it was this serious. I’m taken aback by this, she knew that my daughter was using drugs but didn’t tell me. 

When I asked her why, she told me that she didn’t want to lose my daughters trust, and that she was handling the situation. Obviously not, if shes in the hospital. She apologized and told me that she didn’t think it was serious. I didn’t care. I have the right to know what is going on with my daughter. I am her mother, she is not. 
We ended up getting into an argument, and I told her that she had to leave.

I took my daughters cellphone and laptop, upon her returning home so that I could go through them. I noticed that my sister was trying to contact my daughter. I called her from my daughter’s phone and told her that she is no longer allowed to contact us. I don’t trust her at all. She argued with me about it and made the situation worse by calling me a bad mother and trying to tell me that I don’t know what is right for my child. I told her that she’s the reason my child is using drugs and she’s not allowed to speak to her, and I don’t want to speak to her either. I blocked her number from my daughters phone. 

She called my parents, and they are trying to get me to allow them to have communication. They think that I’m being selfish and reactionary. They don’t seem to care that sister knew that daughter was using drugs without telling me. They think keeping them apart will make my daughters drug abuse worse. They are threatening to stop helping me with the bills if I don’t allow them to talk to each other. I told them that if we end up homeless it would be their faults.

1,"AITA for telling my SIL that she can't say her stillborn baby matters less than her living children? | As background: my SIL had 3 living children before her stillbirth, and then gave birth to another living child 2 years later. Her 4 Earth-side children have fairly common names, like Emma, Lauren, Sophie, and Andrew. Her stillborn daughter has a more unorthodox name, something like Soulstyce. I have one son born sleeping and had several miscarriages. I have no living children, but I'm a mom to a little boy up in Heaven.

Anyways, at Christmas, many of our family members got to meet their new baby for the first time. The subject of how his name was chosen came up, which lead to my grandmother asking why their stillborn daughter had such an ""unusual"" name compared to their living children.

My SIL explained that they gave their daughter a ""guilty pleasure"" name because it mattered less. She said she wouldn't put her living children through the experience of having such an uncommon name, but that it didn't matter when it came to their daughter because she didn't have a life to live with her name. She even joked that she spent a quarter of the time picking out their daughter's name that they did choosing their other children's names because ""it just didn't matter"" and they ""could do whatever.""

It hurt me to hear her say that. I've spent six years feeling like I have no right to call myself a mother and feeling excluded from the ""mom's club"" because my son died from circumstances beyond my control before I even got to hold him. To have my SIL, who I have supported through each and every one of her pregnancies, who I held and comforted through her stillbirth, say that her child *didn't matter* because she wasn't alive - that hurt. It felt very intensely personal. I was right across from her at the table and she said it with no remorse. I don't care if it took her 5 minutes or 5 days to choose a name for her child, I care that she said it didn't matter.

I haven't said a word about it since then. But I lost my job, I've had too much time to think, and I keep replaying the whole thing over in my mind. I've been stewing about it, I keep drawing away from her and I feel guilty. So, I called her and told her that I had been really hurt by what she said. She was very callous, immediately, telling me to get over myself and not tell her how to live her life. I got very upset and told her she couldn't talk about her daughter like she mattered less and she just outright said, ""She does matter less."" I just started to cry. I hung up and my husband consoled me for a while, but my brother called me to chew me out, saying I'd made his wife upset and she was already busy with their children and she didn't need to babysit me as well. I've gotten texts and calls from half the family, most of them blaming me for not moving past my son's death. My own mother told me it was time to start pursuing new family planning options and that I was taking my distress at my loss out on my SIL.

She's a cook and is currently working for some relatives' organization on a gig-by-gig basis. She cooks all meals for groups of people that stay temporarily in a place run by them. Sometimes it's for a couple of days, sometimes it's more than a week, with varying frequency: she might do nothing in two months, and then have 3 gigs in a row.

She loves this job. She has free reign, and it was tailored for her. She even helped designing the kitchen. At first it was only her but now she has an assistant she's become pretty closed to. She has made friends among the organization as well. It also came at a time when we had money issues so we were grateful for it.

There is, however, a series of problems. First of all, her place of work is very far away so she has to stay there for the duration of each job. Which wouldn't be an issue if not for the fact she doesn't have a regular place to stay. Sometimes there's a room available in that place but if not she has to crash somewhere, suitcase in toll. Which could be fixed if not because it's not a well-paid job so we can't afford her own place there.

There are two much bigger issues, though. One, my SO has a physical condition that makes her tired most of the time. She still can work but so much moving around is pushing it. Each time she comes back from a job she stays longer in bed, and she's close to maxxing her meds. And two, this job is straining our relationship. As I said we are together because we want to be together, and yet this thing is keeping us apart sometimes for almost full months at a time. I not only never wanted a long-distance relationship but also living alone makes me anxious and ultimately affects my health, all of which she knows.

Before someone asks, moving there is not an option. Right now we live in a decent apartment of a mid-sized city, I have a full-time job, and we are close to all services and doctors we need for our conditions. She works in a small town in the middle of nowhere with very few job prospects for me, limited rental options, and far from specialized care centers. None of us want that.

I've made myself very clear I want her to quit for both our sakes. She agrees with me but says she doesn't want to leave them in the lurch, so she has volunteered to find and train a replacement. However, not only nobody has looked for any candidates yet, she has also already agreed to do more jobs for the next sixth months. I understand she has a hard time with this because she likes it there, and she doesn't want conflict with her relatives who, after all, gave her the job.

She was in her pre-teens when I met her and now she’s 16. I love everything about her and doing everything with her, even when it’s hard and we disagree on certain things. 

I worried so much about not being able to love her like “my own” despite not having any bio kids (and not wanting any), but whenever I go to her soccer games or dance concerts I feel that I feel the same pride that the other parents in the crowd/on the bleachers feel. I love being able to snuggle with her and talk to her about her day on weekends (since my her dad/my husband isn’t a morning person at all haha), and I love that I can be there for her when she needs me, especially now that school is out for me and her (I am a teacher). 

I honestly hope she feels the same way about me.

However, her biological mom has come back into the picture recently. She got addicted to drugs after extensive surgery for health problems when my daughter was 3 but has told my husband and I that she’s getting into rehab to get better and wants to see her kid again whenever it's a better time to do so, given her condition and what we have going on now. 

But honestly, I’ve been telling my husband I don’t want our kid to see her bio mom, and cited incidents from earlier years where the BM would get sober, reach out, and do 1-2 nice outings with our daughter before spiraling back into drugs again, hurting her in the process. 

Granted, it’s been 3-4 years since she did that, and her bio mom does seem like she has changed for the better (has a job again that pays pretty well, is going back to school for a masters, etc.)

However, the real reason, which I’ve told no one, except for my husband, subtly, is that I feel concerned that my stepdaughter won’t love me as much after she reunites with her bio mom though I’ve said I’d support her regardless of what happens. Even if it hurts. 

Everyone says that the biological connection is super unique and powerful and I’m worried that I’ll lose her when her BM comes back into her life, assuming that her BM has changed and wants to love and care for her.

Surprisingly she obliged easily and this was the routine for a couple weeks. I thought her phase was over as she would eat everything without a hassle.

One day Amber told me that Kylie hasn’t been eating at school and throwing up after diner. I was VERY worried of course and immediately got a therapist and a doctors appointment to check her health. 

The doctor said that she had lost a bit of weight but it wasn’t threatening at the moment but she would need it managed and check regularly. She had a therapist appointment 2-3 times a week. Not much came of it and after about a month she was thinner and weaker. It was horrible, I just wanted to help her.

Thankfully she was making process with the therapist and each day she was improving more, during this time she was rarely able to do cheer which motivated her get healthy.

**Friend:** I only did it because [acquaintance who has a reputation for driving while blackout drunk] was going to drive home so I had to drive him instead!

So, AITA? I personally feel like I’m not wrong to be disgusted by that behaviour, because I’ve done a lot of drinking, and drugs, etc, and I’ve never even *considered* driving while even *slightly* drunk or high. 


I don’t think “I was young I’m a different person now” or “I was drunk and didn’t make good decisions” are good excuses, because I’ve been a young alcoholic party animal too and I NEVER would’ve considered driving drunk, even  when I was too fucked up to remember my own name I could still remember “don’t drive, someone could die”. 


I have to be brutally honest and say that, deep down, I’m worried that anyone who would choose to drive while hammered just secretly doesn’t give a shit about other people and the fact that they might die. Anyone who would cheerfully bring up, and make excuses for, driving drunk in the past is probably still asshole too, since they obviously don’t feel ashamed of doing it, right? 


On the other hand, my friends who are still talking to me think I’m a completely judgmental asshole.

1,"UPDATE: AITA for forcing myself to bond with my boyfriend/fiance's daugher? | [Original post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c60m3b/aita_for_forcing_myself_to_bond_with_my/).

I read over the replies to the post and thought really hard about it, although I admit I was often argumentative and didn't really want to listen for the most part. 

Meanwhile, my fiance's daughter came home shortly after I wrote the post. I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. 

I opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.

She reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that ""I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had."" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.

Since her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. 

Now that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to ""force myself"" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. 

But I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors. Without her, I wouldn't get nearly as many hugs or as much love, and more importantly, I'd have missed out on getting really close with someone as intelligent, talented, and passionate as she is. 

When she was away for the past month or so at school/traveling for the summer, I actually *really* missed her and know that my life wouldn't be the same without her. I missed her hugs, love and her snarky commentary on our favorite shows. I love all the hugs/appreciation I've gotten from her, but she's enriched my life in so many ways. 

So no, Reddit, my boyfriend and I are not getting divorced or breaking off the engagement anytime soon. But thank you for making me really reflect on my thoughts/potential behaviors towards her. I know see how suddenly withholding love could really be harmful towards someone who's gotten close to me (and someone I've grown really close to also). 

I think my fiance's daughter and I will just continue as we are and hopefully grow even closer throughout the years :)",False,False,5,3,4,2,1,4,Care,472
1,"WIBTA if I lied to my husband about how much I’m spending on a trip? | Throwaway because my husband uses Reddit. Also sorry for formatting because I’m on mobile. 

So here’s the thing, me and my husband are going on a trip together soon. It’s actually the very first trip we take together. He has a hard, manual labor job and very rarely has time off. And when he does it never matches mine, because I have a regular 9-5 job. 

We are both very excited about our first vacation together, since we didn’t even get to have a honeymoon. Thing is, my husband is insisting in contributing equally to the cost of the trip. 

He comes from a very poor background and is used to pretty much nothing and having to work his ass off his whole life for what he has. 
I admire this very very much, but we don’t live in those conditions anymore. I have a great job and I make really good money, so I am comfortable paying for a large percentage of the trip. 

For a bit of context on the trip: we live in Europe and we are planning on going to a small, European capital. The places I’m looking to book are not ridiculously expensive, just regular b&b’s somewhere in the city, with little to nothing included. Something simple because we don’t really need much. 

On my husbands budget, best we could afford would be something like a hostel with shared rooms and bathrooms. Which is not a bad place, but for a first husband and wife vacation I think I’d like a bit of privacy with him... 

I was thinking in telling him that I got a really good “advance purchase” deal and say that the price was much cheaper than what I am actually paying for. 

I don’t want my husband to feel bad about himself on something has little as money, I understand why he feels like this and that’s why I don’t want to insist in paying and make him feel like “he is living off of me” (his words). He contributes so much to the household and works so hard, I couldn’t care less about who makes more or less money because I know we are both very invested in each other. 

Also, it’s not like I’m putting us in debt or asking for loans. I have more than enough to afford this on my savings account. 

He’s the best in the world and he works so hard all the time, I think he deserves a nice vacation. So WIBTA if I lied about the cost of the trip?",False,False,5,3,4,2,1,4,Care,443
1,"AITA for constantly adopting new animals without asking permission from my SO? | For context, I own the house I live in. I work from home and I own a business- I am completely able to take care of the animals I adopt by myself. My boyfriend and I started dating 4 years ago and moved in together 2 years ago. I have always been wealthy, but very good with my money. When we started dating I made sure to let him know I have no self-control when it comes to animals in need and I would adopt any and all animals that needed me.

&#x200B;

He lives with me rent-free. He's currently in university studying full time. He does have a job but all expenses go towards paying off his university debt. I pay a maid to come in and clean once a week. The house is completely clean all the time; the animals inside the main house do not make a mess. We have a granny flat outside that I use to keep the rest of my animals. 

&#x200B;

Recently we had a massive fight because I brought home a new pet. This would be rescue number 23. I got her from an online listing. She's an incredibly underweight female rat (about half the weight she should be) as well as a URI. She's been checked out by my vet and my vet is confident she'll be completely fine. My boyfriend got so angry at me and said he's sick of all these animals and if I didn't stop rescuing them he'd leave me.

&#x200B;

I told him he was being unreasonable since it's my house and he doesn't see the animals all that often. He responded saying he hates rodents and he hates that I walk around with them on my shoulder constantly (along with handling other animals). He told me it's not fair to him to not tell him I got a new pet until after I got it and I told him it's none of his business what I do in my house. I told him to get the fuck out of my house until he learned some damn respect. I've done nothing but support him, but I absolutely will not budge about literally saving the lives of animals in distress. I adopt the oldest, most unwell animals I possibly can because no one else would.

1,"AITA for getting tired of my daughter's complaining about her childhood? | My adopted daughter had her first child about six months ago and very shortly after entered a major depressive episode. She's struggled with depression all her life and at this point in time it's gotten near impossible to function. I've been helping her out immensely-she moved back in, I pay for her living, and she's working on taking care of herself and working to a place where she can handle things like other people and a job again, while getting on medication for her depression. It's going well, she's working hard to get more stable, and it feels like starting over again as a mother-I've always loved the baby stage best.

Since this my biological daughter has become bitchy and unpleasant. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she thought it was ""fucked up"" that I opted out of parenting both my children, sort of blaming me for their mental health, and then I play mother of the year for a baby that isn't mine. I let it go because to an extent I see her point. I was a young, single, working mother, so I didn't spend much time with either of my children. I wasn't the most mature or best equipped to handle them like I am now. I figured she would get over it if I let her vent.

She didn't get any happier or nicer, so I asked again. And again. And she kept complaining about her *terrible* childhood and how awful I was. Eventually I got sick of it and told her the reality-she was a problem child and I was in over my head trying to do my best. I had to handle her underage drinking, drug use, frequent arrests, and an expulsion and she never made it easy. She said that she hoped her sister got her act together before my grandchild gets old enough that I lose interest. That was my last straw and I told her to stop talking to me until she can be respectful and polite.

My husband (her step-father) has refused to take my side, going so far as to say I'm being disrespectful and I have to acknowledge I was a bad mom once. I feel like everyone is ganging up on me, and the only people who aren't mad at me are my adopted daughter and grandson.

She lives in another state so I haven't seen her in person for a couple years to be sure, but i see her in video chat and pictures at least once a month, and every time she seems heavier. I don't know her weight or bmi, and I don't know if she knows either. I also wouldn't ask for this information. From looks alone (which can obviously be heavily skewed, especially when you can't see them in person) I think she's at least obese at this point, and still seems to be gaining.

I'm starting to really worry about her physical and mental health. A few years ago she complained about (undiagnosed) binge eating disorder, and I'm not sure if that's still a concern or what her eating habits are like. To my knowledge she hasn't had any health problems at all, but particularly not any due to her weight. Still, i worry there may be undetected health problems or that some may pop up if she continues to gain.

I have other reasons why I think i should probably keep my mouth shut, besides there being no known health concerns. 1, to my knowledge her weight is never discussed unless it's insults from her thin sister. I don't want to create any more insecurities or comparisons there. 2, I've had my own history with eating disorders (Anorexia with some binge/purge) and the last she saw me in person I was very underweight (now I'm a healthy bmi and in treatment, doing much better) so i worry that either she'll see how unhealthy I was and think I'm just a hypocrite or projecting my weight fears on to her or that I may ACTUALLY be projecting my weight fears on to her, or at least overly concerned due to my past.

I don't think I'm exaggerating her size when i see her, and I think my concerns may be valid, but I'm not sure if it's my place to voice these concerns or if it's ever helpful to discuss someone's weight. I've considered talking to her mom instead of going directly to her, but then I feel like I'd just be talking shit behind her back.

He excels in math and physics and everything in between. He is going to college and taking hard classes that he does well in. Lately, he has been depressed. More than depressed. A couple of months ago, he tried to take his own life by getting drunk and swallowing a bottle of acetaminophen. He and I are extremely close and he only talks to me.

Effectively she's had a rough few months finding out her work contract won't be extended after giving everything to the job to such an extent that she neglected herself.

The last few weeks have been hard, she had overtime to make up, she had applications to get in, and she had struggled to keep up with going to the gym in order to meet her weight loss goals. The latter is what we agreed she should ease off on, as it was critical that she made back time at work and got on with applying for jobs she's capable of moving into.

Thing is she's always had a difficult relationship with food, and in the last few weeks the habits have crept in again.

Over reliance on takeaway. Daily chocolate bars.

Tonight I said to her I'll cook a nice veggie pasta, she said yeah, 10 mins later, ""can you get me some chocolate""

Before I could think I'd replied that I lived her, and I was growing concerned that she has a long history of eating too much refined sugar, and in the last 3 days she had gone through 2 (standard UK ) large bars of chocolate. It wasn't the chocolate that upset me, it's the thought of my gf putting herself at risk of type 2 diabetes.

I did not say. No, you've had too much chocolate, it's her choice, I said I'll get some but I had to be honest about my concern. I expressed this.

So there is a bit of a culture clash that I am taking into account.

My girlfriend is my sister's best friend and she had to give a speech. She is VERY nervous speaking in front of crowds but she wanted to give a speech for my sister. 

She starts the speech and is visibly nervous as her voice shakes a little. My side of the family is quiet but a couple of people from the groom's family shout out ""no need to be nervous, we're all friends here!"" I wanted no one to interrupt but that wasn't a big deal.

What started to annoy me was that as the speech went on, and she told a joke, the rural side would erupt with laughter as if it was the funniest thing in the world (even though it was only worthy of a chuckle and she knew that). The bride and groom seemed to be enjoying the speech and didn't mind the people constantly heckling but I was getting pissed off.

I eventually called out to them ""will you slack jawed bumpkins shut the fuck up and let her finish?"" and they all stayed quiet.

Despite that he is very funny and charming and mamaged to find a serious girlfriend. They dated for two years. After they broke up he basically lived at the gym. He lost a lot of weight and is now above average in looks and coupled with his personality he should have got a massive confidence boost.

That's where I'm at right now. 

I could go on dramatically and bore everyone so I will try and keep this simple. Three years ago I broke up with a guy who literally checked every box I have because he was in the Navy and moving and I felt like I owed to myself to finish grad school. I decided that if I kept in touch with him in any way I would drop everything and willingly become a happy housewife so I changed my number, deleted all social media and got on with the business of getting over him. Call him Charlie. 


Fast forward to last week, I work in a large office complex and evert single day this very sweet, cute guy walks past our front door and we wave. We've chatted a few times so I know his name. On Wednesday he very nervously asked me out and he was just so nice and earnest and sweetly awkard that I said yes. 


We went out last night and I was having a nice time but was like MAYBE there's possibility here but I liked him as a person. I went to the bathroom and ran smack into Charlie's parents. They always loved me and when they said that Charlie had just moved back into town for his next assignment, my knee's literally got weak. His mom asked for my number and without even thinking I gave it to her. I said goodbye and rejoined my date. 


It wasn't even 15 minutes and Charlie texted me ""is this really you?"" I texted back ""yes"" and then he asked where I was. I told him I was at a restaurant and he asked if he could come pick me up. Again without even thinking I said yes. I told my date that I was having a family emergency and that was the reason for the texts. He offered to give me a ride home. I told him that it was ok and my brother was coming to pick me up. I said I was so sorry and I paid for our entire meal but he insisted on waiting with me out front. When Charlie pulled up and it was the first time I'd seen him in 3 years I again got weak in the knees. I told my date that he was my brother but I could absolutely tell by the look in his eyes he knew I was lying but he was way too nice of a guy to call me out on my bullshit. 


Of course it was instant chemistry with Charlie and after playing an hour of catch up we were back at my house doing what we did best. Only he's such an amazing such an amazing guy he said he wanted to slow down a bit and not take it all the way, instead he tucked me in and left with a kiss on the forehead. He's on his way over now to take me to a champagne brunch. I'm ready to drive to vegas and get married and never say goodbye to him again.  


But enough of the school girl gushing and back to the problem. I feel AWFUL for what I did to my date last night. I don't know what to do or say to him and I know I'm going to see him tomorrow. I guess to help me know how to plan for tomorrow, I guess finding out if I am a light asshole, a major asshole or even some small chance NTA would be very helpful.

1,"AITA for telling gf I'd rather never hang out at her house again after she invited me over ? | TL;DR: girlfriend invited me to her house which was very rundown and made me feel uneasy, I got called an asshole by friend after I told her that I'd rather never visit it again.

My girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for about 2 months now, when we meet up it's either outside or at my place. Whenever I'd bring up going to her place, she'd shoot the idea down, saying that since her sister is recovering from a sickness she needed peace and quiet at the house.

Well yesterday she had a change of heart, and told me that she'd meet at my place then we could go to hers. First of all, her house ended up not being where she told me it would be. At first she said it would be near a popular mall, but it ended up being blocks away and we had to walk to get there, and essentially it was in a different area that is considered ""the slums"". So I really didn't appreciate how she misled me, and that we had to walk in a dangerous area after we got off the bus.

Now when it came to the house itself, not to be insensitive, but it was very rundown and honestly when she first said ""this is it"" I thought it was a joke. The paint was peeling, some of the pipes were visible outside and they were rusty and yellowish. The inside was worse. I mean it was clean, but they had concrete stairs INSIDE THE HOUSE!! The wallpaper was peeling and the kitchen and bathroom tiles were crooked, the appliances there were also very old and so were the cabinets. She made me lunch and it took double the amounts it probably would have took to make in my apartment because the stove couldn't be set on too high. There wasn't a lot of furniture, and the couch they had in the living room was pretty much on its last legs.

Then we went to her room, and honestly felt like some rundown hostel room where they'd hold someone hostage. It had floor tiles in it which wtf, a small bed and closet, and a patchy carpet. Plus medical equipment that she kept there in case her sister needed it. We sat down and she tried to talk and was cracking jokes but all I could feel was unease because I've really never been somewhere like that, so I left after a while and made up an emergency about how my roommate needed me to open the door for him. She insisted on walking me to the bus station and it was awkward.

She texted me at night asking me if everything was alright, and I told her the truth: that I knew that financially her and her family were really struggling because of her sister's medical bills, but that being at her home made me feel uneasy because of how it was and that I preferred that we never hangout there again, and instead either meet up at my place which is much nicer or outside. She texted me back very passive-agressively and then stopped responding to my texts, and when I told a friend about what happened he said I was being a dick for criticizing her home.

1,"AITA for telling my sister to grow up? | I am 28M and my sister is 25F.  We did NOT get along as kids. She was the typical annoying little sister and I was the mean older brother.  I teased her a lot growing up, but I did my best to make sure that if I did tease her or if we did have a fight that I said sorry or made her feel like I didn't mean any of it.  I never wanted her to go to bed thinking we were not on good terms.

She moved out when I was 22 and she was 19, I went to her farewell party and I really thought we were good, I never apologized for what I did but I was proud of her for going to college.   We stayed in contact about once a month just saying how our lives are going, We weren't close but we weren't pushing it and I enjoyed seeing her tell me whats going on in her life.    She came back for thanksgiving when I was 23 and she was 20, and it went well.  I saw her in person like one more time at christmas when I was 25 and she was 22.  I didn't go to any family holidays on my side for like 3 years since I got really serious with my SO (we got engaged 2 months ago).  and I went to her families place for those holidays since we lived closer.

Yesterday was my dad's birthday and I haven't seen him in person for a few years so I spent quite a bit of money to have me and my SO fly down to their house and stay the week.  My sister was there too, I was happy to see her in person again and have her meet my SO.  The whole party was fine and I know my parents were happy that both their kids were together in their house again.  At night when my parents went to bed.  I was having a drink with my sister, when my SO was going to the store for breakfast material.  The subject of our past years somehow came up, I told her I feel bad and I'm sorry for any troubles I gave her during that time. I could tell she was kinda miffed and idk if it was the alcohol talking but she basically said that once our parents die, she doesn't want much to do with me cause how much of an ass I was when we were kids.  I was SHOCKED when she said that, because I thought we both moved on from that and thought we had a loving/caring (yet distant) relationship.  I didn't even know what to say, I was/am heart broken because I do love her and always wanted us to at least be caring towards each other but she basically said she has no desire to do much with me kinda hurt.  I finally got it out and said ""what we did as kids was YEARS ago and if your still on about that then you just need to grow up, I'm sorry how I treated you but it shouldn't be the basis of why you hate me now.""  

She didn't say anything after that but ""you done?"" and then went to bed. The next day she talked to me like nothing happened, I was weirded out by that but didn't want to make a scene in front of our parents who still have the view of us being close.

1,"AITA for asking my wife to shower when she smells like sour breast milk | My wife had our first baby in June. I had 2 weeks of leave and my wife gets 4 months. Our baby breastfeeds and my wife is doing a great job. It's an exhausting ordeal and I often acknowledge the hard work she is doing that I don't have to do.

Since she's getting ready to go back to work, and so I can help more with feeding, she has been building up a milk supply. When she is not nursing the baby she is pumping, and because of some mouth issues the baby has half of its milk given via bottle already.

One thing I wasn't prepared for was the smell of sour breastmilk. My wife doesn't have OCD, but she's always been the cleaner one of us, and I have been impressed that her habits haven't changed despite the baby. She takes care of our pets and still keeps the house clean (I help out inside the house too but it's always been ""her"" area). However, it seem like milk gets on everything. All over baby, all over my wife, all over towels and blankets, and of course there is the endless supply of bottles and parts that have to be sterilized. It's a lot to take care of but my wife has been amazing. She dotes on the baby and changes its clothes after every feeding, so usually the smell isn't strong on the baby. Unfortunately, that doesn't apply to my wife.

When I get home, the first thing I want to do is greet my wife and baby. It's the best part of my day, but when I go to hug/kiss my wife, the smell of soured milk literally makes me gag. It's extra bad when I just came in from outside and can smell it very strong. I try to be tactfully honest with her and explain I know it isn't from lack of hygiene. She'll change her clothes when I get home but it's still on her skin. It's become a real issue and I feel terrible because my wife is already upset about having to return to work and be away from baby, and she's exhausted from taking care of baby alone all day. She said I make her feel disgusting. When I ask her to take a shower, she cries and says she hasn't been able to because she's been holding the baby. She says when she hasn't had a minute of alone time all day, the first thing she wants to do when I take the baby from her is not always take a shower.

What's the solution here? Even though I am trying to convince her she doesn't disgust me, just the smell does, she says I am making her feel awful about something she can't help. I even suggested that we hire someone to come give her a break for even just a couple days a week so she could take care of herself, but she said that if I say that it means I don't think she is able to do it (also while crying). That is not true, but the smell does make me gag and as much as I try to suck it up, I can't control it. I can't believe that of all things in all the years we have been together, this is what's driving a wedge between us.

Am I the asshole here? Is it unreasonable of me to ask her to take a shower when I get home, even while I am offering to pay someone to come help with the baby so that she can do so?",False,False,4,3,2,1,2,3,Care,621
1,"AITA for putting my 9yo on a diet and 'emotionally damaging' her? | Ex (32f) and I (34m) have a 9yo daughter 'M'.
We broke up when M was 5 and I moved away, I would see M in breaks and speak on the phone so I was as involved as I could be.

Last year I move back. I now have her alternate weeks.

I had noticed M starting to put on weight. She's not obese but seeing her in person, I've noticed she has a belly which hangs over her waistband, and she wears 12-13 clothes despite being only 9. 

I spoke to ex and she got defensive, saying that M ate what she eats (ex is skinny and healthy) and has a sport she goes to twice a week. I asked about portion sizes and other exercise (twice a week for 90mins isn't that much) I was trying to stay friendly but ex shut me down.

I know weight gets harder to lose the older you get so I decided to keep a close eye and do what I could on her weeks with me. 

I did not put her on a crash diet but I did start using a portion control plate and packing lean lunches instead of letting her buy her food. (Carrot sticks, yogurt, flavoured steamed chicken breast etc.) M complained at first but then seemed fine with this. 

I also took her to the gym with me 4 times a week, my gym have parent and child classes.

The only thing I said to M about it is that we were working to set her up for the future being physically fit and mindful of what she eats.

So last week a kid is having a birthday and the parents are taking a small group to the movies and after to sleepover. The parents asked that everyone send their kid with their own snack and then the parents would buy popcorn on top to share.

I'm trying to show my kid that snacks can be healthy, so I sent her with a bag of veggie sticks and hummus. She made a little fuss about not getting candy but seemed fine.

I dropped her off and ex was gonna pick her up. Next day ex texts. I head over and ex isnt happy, M is upset and won't look at me.
Apparently when they were sat at waiting for the movie kids started comparing snacks. M told the other kids that they were gonna get fat and unhealthy bc their parents gave them those snacks. She said she had to eat the veggies so she could lose weight, and she wasn't allowed any popcorn (I never said this).
Then at their house after they ordered pizza for the kids M refused to eat saying she was gonna get fat. The parents called ex and she came and got her.

M was crying saying that she was scared if she ate anything bad she'd put on weight and everyone would hate her. She told ex about our diet and gym. I hadn't because it was my weeks and why should I divulge all our plans.

Ex ranted saying M always came home tired and refusing to eat. She blames me for giving M a complex when she was healthy and active. I said if she was healthy she wouldn't have a belly and be bigger than other girls. I said that at least I cared about what the girl puts in her mouth and she said M was happier before I moved back. Now ex is telling me she won't send her back to me if I don't stop 'emotionally damaging' her.

1,"AITA for getting my grandsons hair cut?? | This obviously isn't from today but it came up and had me wondering if I really did do something wrong. I have a 2 year old grandson with hair that grows insanely fast. His hair was past his shoulders when he got his first haircut at 4 months old. My daughter is super picky about hair. She pretty much refuses to try out new hairstylists unless necessary and once she finds one she likes won't see anyone else.


Well his hair was starting to get pretty long and messy because he hadn't had a haircut in a while, she said she didn't have the money at the moment but would get it cut when she did anytime I mentioned it. I asked if I could take him to get it cut, and she said only if I use his stylist. It's at this one kids place and after tip the haircuts are nearly $30. I said I didn't want to spend that much on a 2 year olds hair and that I'd take him to the place I usually go.


She refused to let me take him if it wasn't hers, so I dropped it. A bit later, we watched him while she was sick, and she had a prescription she asked if we could grab for her. I figured to pass the time waiting for the medicine I'd go get the him a haircut. I took him to my stylist, since they only charge like $10 for kids.


Well she wasn't used to cutting childrens hair. She had a hard time cutting it with him moving around so much, and ended up just doing the best she could. It wasn't horrible, but it was fairly choppy and uneven. There was no way she was going to be able to fix it though because he kept pulling away and trying to push the scissors away.


Anyways, when we took him back home she freaked out the second she saw him asking what the hell we did to her child's hair. I told her I took him to get his hair cut, and she said that this is EXACTLY why she said not to in the first place, now her sons hair is all screwed up and they cut it too short to even be able to take him to get it properly fixed elsewhere without shaving it all off. She was nearly in tears over it. I told her I was simply trying to help out because his hair was getting too long and messy, but she didn't want to hear it. Every time I saw her or talked to her after that, she would make a comment about how awful his poor hair looked and she sure hoped it hurried and grew out so she could get it cut properly. 


She did get it cut later on, and even during that haircut she was telling the stylist about how I didn't listen to her last time and let someone screw his hair up. Well she just told me ""just so you know, when this is over with, you are NOT getting his hair cut. He can wait until I can take him, even if it's a month or so after I have this baby."" 


I thought it wasn't a big deal, but she's still mad, her husband actually seemed upset about it, and my wife got mad at me too, and the hairstylist laughed at me and said ""yeah, grandpa lost his privileges to take him for haircuts with that screw up!"" when they were talking about it.

Last year, I gifted my wife expensive tickets to a show I thought she might enjoy. She got upset that I spent hundreds of dollars on a concert for an artist that she never once expressed in.

This year, I wanted to surprise my wife for V-day with something nice. I rented a nice ass car for the day to take her out, bought her flowers/candy, wrote her 5 nice cards, took her to lunch, movie, store, and had an evening activity planned as well. While she was ok at first, she started to get cranky 5 hours into the day because she didn't have a chance to get coffee because I was taking her around from 1 place to another. (I will say that my wife is extremely religious about her coffee. She knows what she likes and doesn't like when it comes to coffee and needs ONE cup every day). To be fair, I did have a lot of stuff planned today. She was also stressed because she had a job interview (she is currently unemployed) and I went with her to the interview in the fancy car so that we could start the planned day of activities right after. Just today, here is what she complained about:

&#x200B;

not having coffee all day when i know that's the only thing she needs every day (she doesn't care about food as much as she cares about getting her one cup of coffee)

me spending $ on a fancy car (when she doesn't care for fancy cars and because we only rode in it fror about 20 minutes each way and the car was parked all day in the city)

me taking her to my favorite weed store as part of the surprise and having to wait 30 minutes for the guy to show up to the store (if i had told her what we were doing, she would have gotten coffee in that time but i kept it a surprise)

me giving her nice or fancy gifts when she doesn't want or care for them

me making her walk in the cold when she had thin dress pants on for the interview and not allowing her any time to change. . .

me getting upset when she doesn't show appreciation for my efforts

me not taking medication for my depression

me not going to sleep on time (reason for my tiredness)

I don't get it. I try and she's not happy. Every time I surprise her with nice things or notes, she questions it.

I told her that she's a sad person too. She took that to heart and called me a defensive asshole and left my car to walk the rest of her way home.

1,"AITA for telling my friend to go home to her baby? | A good friend of mine was celebrating her birthday this weekend. It was her 30th so she decided on dinner and a night out clubbing. We both had babies this year. Mine is 7 months old and hers in 9 weeks old. She isn’t with the father so she had another one of our close friend’s—who was to be in attendance—have her mother watch the baby. She expected to watch the baby overnight and that we’d all sleep at someone’s house at the end of the night as you’re no good to an infant if you’re drunk. 

I don’t live in the same city as birthday girl so I made my way over, baby in tow, to the city where most of my friends live and where the birthday was being celebrated. My sister also lives in the city so she’d be babysitting for me that night. I could have left baby with dad but I didn’t feel comfortable leaving the baby alone with him from Friday-Monday. I’m 5 hours away so it’s not close enough that I thought it appropriate. 

I get to the city the party’s being held and and drop my baby off at my sisters and head out. 

We get to *decorated house* and start getting ready. Everyone is pre-drinking, doing make up and getting ready. I was soooo looking forward to going out with my friends but it just wasn’t in the books for me. I got ready, did my hair, make up, put on a dress and was ready to head out the door. Collectively, we took so long to get ready that dinner was cancelled and everyone decided to go straight to the club. I broke it to all my friends individually that I wouldn’t be coming. They understood. I didn’t so much as take a shot so I drove to my sister and knocked out. 

The next day (Saturday), my friends tell me they went out, some of them went back to decorated house and drank until the afternoon when they all passed out. Some of them wok up around 3/4 am and that’s when Birthday Girl got a call from a guy she’s interested in. He invited her over to come have some drinks and she decided to go. Another friend of mine who was still over told me this when I spoke to her around 8am the next morning. I told her I was disappointed in Birthday Girl and that she shouldn’t be going out on paper tying benders with a small infant. She agreed. I told her I thought someone should tell her her behavior is inappropriate and that she should go home to her baby. She said I should do so because I’m also a new mom. 

I sent her a text: 

“[Redacted]. I love you. [redacted] is an infant, two weeks ago he was a newborn. You can’t leave him for this long. He doesn’t show it but he misses you. One night is ok but he’s so small now.

(She's concerned as she only works a few hours each weekend, and the money she gets often goes (but not always) for household/kid's needs. She has access to our ""joint account"", which is where my salary goes in, and which pays for all rent/bills/car payments/everything else.)

&#x200B;

I would love for her to go, especially as she's been wanting some time away from the kids and normal routine, so I messaged my older sister (40F) who is planning the hen do and asked how much money my wife would need for the day, so that my wife would know what to expect/budget for. She replied that it's a very low key affair, mostly at her home, but one part will have a small cost and she'd be happy to pay for my wife because she'd love for her to come. I replied asking to know any costs and that I'd contribute as well if needed. It ends up that the cost would be less than £20.

She then said that she'd pay for it herself anyway, or that she'd just use the joint account(!).  By the end of the argument, she was in a foul mood, and I'm back in the doghouse again. My argument to her was that my sister's generosity was borne out of no bad intention, and that me getting involved was was also not ill-intentioned.

My initial feeling was that my wife is being pretty rude and ungrateful, but I understand that there's always some embarrassment when you feel that you can't afford something that someone then pays for you.  However, if that thing is paid for out of generosity and love and affection, then why not be grateful and not look a gift horse in the mouth. I'd love it if someone paid for a day out for me!

1,"AITA for insulting my cheating ex over the fact her father left her as a child? | Hi, this is a throwaway as I don’t want this linked to my main account. Apologies for mobile formatting yada yada.

So I’ll get right into it. I (19m) go to a top university in the UK. I am a second year and live with my ex girlfriend (19f) and 3 of our mutual friends. This came about because in my first year, I started dating my now ex near the start of Uni and we all decided to live together for second year. Near the end of the year she cheated on me by sleeping with some random bloke she’d pulled in a club. I confronted her and broke it off. 

Fast forward to September and the arrangement is now very awkward as we’re not on speaking terms, yet share a house. There is a lot of tension and mutual dislike in the air. She has done a lot of petty things so far this year which I won’t get into, but safe to say she’s pissed off everyone in the house and there are arguments almost daily. 

Well a couple of nights ago I was coming back from a night out with my friends at around 2 or 3am, and it’s possibly important here to note that she doesn’t have any friends at university, whereas I am involved in several societies, was always the ‘popular’ social butterfly of our house, go out multiple times a week etc and that this was always a point of contention during our relationship as, though she didn’t like to admit it, she was always jealous. 

I went into the kitchen to fill up a bottle of water. I’m quite drunk at this point. Well lo and behold she is in there and turns to me to say something along the lines of ‘drunk again?’ With a smirk and belittled me for enjoying myself. I said it’s not my fault she’s a loner and that nobody likes her, we argued a bit about cleaning and other household issues. She then says that at least Adam liked her and that’s why she cheated because he was better than me, which really pissed me off.

I mention how lonely it must be to have no friends and family being so far away and ask if she heard me the other night with a girl I’d brought home. She said she’s glad she hurt me and asked if I’ve mentally recovered. She knew I had on and off mental health issues while we dated. Which was the final straw as I had further mental health issues for most of that summer as a direct result of her. I said to her, shouting, ‘at least my daddy didn’t fucking leave me when I was 5, if he could see you now he’d leave all over again you dirty little cunt.’

She burst out crying and ran from the kitchen. She had her mum pick her up the next day, and I haven’t seen her since. My housemates, who already dislike her are on my side. My friends and family are also on my side for the most part. 
I knew her insecurities from our time together and said the most hurtful thing I could muster, specifically targeting what I knew would cause the most pain and distress and probably took it too far, so while I hate her, I’m aware I’m probably in the wrong, though remorse still eludes me.

1,"AITA for criticising my boyfriend's death at his school memorial? | N (18 M) and I graduated high school last year together. N was genuinely faultless. He was such a gentle, kind soul, but he had his personal problems. You know, being ""perfect"" always has its downsides. For every issue N felt like he couldn't fix in any aspect of his life, that made him sad. And beyond his social life with his girlfriend (me) and his friends, his family life was really troubled. His parent (mother) was absent when he was 2, and his older brother; a drug-addict, criminally convicted drop kick (opposite to N, who was a straight A student and a guy who cared for the feelings of those close to him), couldn't even maintain a job. He'd just end up let go after so long. N and their father helped N's older brother find work and would allow them to stay at their place when he'd eventually lose work. It was tough for all of them. N's dad is nice man and he's the one I truly feel for in this situation. I tried my best to reassure N with lots of affection and love, but it worked only for short moments.

It all wasn't enough for N though. 2nd of January early morning, I got a text from N's brother that N had been found dead in a car wreck into a ditch with a few friends. Apparently they were all drunk celebrating New Years and the driver and two other passengers died at the scene too. When I first heard of N's death... I was mad. Anger at N's friends who admitted to cops they pressured him into drinking that night, and anger at myself for not being with him prior to that morning. At the same time I felt sad, but no tears came out. I felt blank. I couldn't grieve properly for the love of my life. How pathetic is that? So my parents recommended I see a therapist for a few days which helped for naught. Waste of money to be honest.

And so, this memorial was held for him with tons of people who knew and loved N seated in a gymnasium at our old school start of Feb, and I was just so angry for N. I couldn't breathe. So when it was my time to speak, instead of the pre-written garbage I wrote, I simply said off my head: ""Why am I upset about N leaving? Because he didn't need to. It wasn't his fault. He was abandoned by people, and misused by people. His friends and family was shitty. And now he's gone. He left me behind. I can't breathe because of him. I don't know about you, but to me, he was just scared. You may love him, like I do. And I love him with every inch of my heart, but it doesn't change the fact that he died without ever living life properly."" I spoke more of the same thing, lambasting people N knew, and praising N at the same time.

My ""eulogy"" for N was met with disgust from just about everybody I know just after I finished, particularly N's dad who is hung up on me naming N's shitty family which I admit I should have made the distinction didn't include his dad, and N's brother (ick), who called me a ""fucking heartless cunt"". I can't take that from N's brother of all people, whose failures I'm sure contributed to N's state of mind. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,2,Care,593
1,"AITA for canceling a hotel reservation with my pregnant friend before consulting her? | I'm going out of town for a wedding this weekend and was supposed to stay in an Airbnb with three friends - Mandy; Annie, who is six months pregnant; and Annie's husband, Dan. It will feel like 100+ degrees F when we are there this weekend.

&#x200B;

Yesterday morning, I noticed that our Airbnb did not have air conditioning. I reached out to the host and asked them about window units, and ultimately they were only able to install one, in the living room. I was worried for Annie's health, and I didn't want to stay in that heat, either, so I called Airbnb to see what my recourse was. My intention wasn't necessarily to outright cancel, but to see if maybe they could move us, and what our options would be if they couldn't. After two hours on the phone with them, the only option they gave me was to cancel, and they managed to negotiate with the host to let us cancel with a partial (half) refund - originally, the host wanted to give us nothing. I was on the phone and forced to make a decision, so I accepted and canceled. We each lost about $50 with the cancellation. Had this all been happening over email, I would've texted them and gotten their okay before proceeding, but I had to make the choice over the phone.. so I did.

&#x200B;

I hadn't told Annie about any of this because I didn't want to stress her out, but I did tell Mandy. She was of course frustrated that we had lost $50, she agreed that it was the right choice. Then I called Annie. She was livid. She told me that I had no right to make ""decisions about her health and her body"" and that I should've talked to her before doing anything. She didn't let me explain how this had all come about. I told her I had spoke with some friends who would let her stay with them for free, and she said she didn't want to do that. I told her we could book a hotel and Mandy and I would even split the cost if money was the concern, and she said no. She told me she would talk it over with Dan and get back to me on next steps. A few hours later, she texted me and said that I could book a hotel but she would only pay up to a certain amount, and we ""owed her"" for stressing her out.

&#x200B;

I was surprised by how angry she got, but whatever, I figured it was over. Then this morning she texts me and says she needs to tell me how she feels for the sake of our friendship. She sends four very long texts saying that ""unless \[me\] and Dan are dead, you don't get to make decisions about me and my family"" and there are f-bombs and saying that I had no right to make any decisions or get other people involved in this situation.

&#x200B;

I'm flabbergasted at how upset she got last night, and I'm even more flabbergasted by her texts this morning. I've never had a friend speak to me this way, and I feel like she's blown things wayyyyy out of proportion. At this point I have absolutely no interest in being around here, so I'm planning to pay for my part of the hotel but stay with my friends. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,3,1,3,Care,591
1,"AITA for sending my son to live at his grandfathers? | My first wife died when my oldest son was 3 and my youngest was only 9 months old. I remarried when they were 8 and 5 and then had another son with my Second Wife (SW) when they were 10 and 7. My first two boys never fully got along with my SW, but they did learn to get better as they got older, even though the older one never fully got along with her.

To put things lightly they fought a lot. There was usually a blowout once every month or two and they could never see eye to eye. A good portion of the fights were caused when my oldest would call her on anything he felt was unfair, especially in the treatment of my youngest to the older two. The youngest definitely did get preferential treatment, but that's what you'd expect from someone caring for their actual child as apposed to kids that came with me as a package deal. 

They both went to therapy separately to try and work things out when my oldest was 14 and he told me his therapist told him to stop engaging her as they saw no other alternative. SW didn't like that and threatened to divorce me but she also hadn't worked since my youngest was born so she wouldn't have any source of income meaning she'd take my money, youngest son, and consequently my house away if that were to happen. We wen't to therapy together and worked many of our issues out but the issue with her and my oldest still stood.

I got them to go to therapy together after that and it only lasted one session because she spent the entire hour telling the therapist all the nasty things she felt about him. He didn't talk to me much after that and I found the whole situation very hard because I didn't want to choose sides to make it look like I favoured one or the other. That was the case for most of the arguments between them, where I just didn't know what to do and I didn't want to pick sides. My relationship with my oldest became more and more distant after that but things started to turn around when he went to university.

He came back however, and fought with his younger brother (16 at the time) and they didn't speak for a month. He then went to work at a summer camp he'd been working at for 4 years and called me a month and a half in saying he wanted to go home because he wasn't happy with how the new leadership was treating the staff that year. He was fighting with his step mom, now his brother, and his camp too. I couldn't handle it so I sent him to live with his grandfather and he hasn't talked to me since.

It's been 2 years and he still hasn't spoken to me and I'm starting to wonder if my decision to have him elsewhere was wrong. I couldn't handle the fighting but he called me asking to come home. He was fighting for better working conditions and he was an essential team member to that camp so I know his heart was in the right place even if he was fighting once again. I just couldn't risk the strain on my family that his anger was causing. So with that, AITA for sending my son to live with his grandfather?",False,False,4,3,2,3,1,2,Care,591
1,"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend's children to stay at our house? | I've been with my boyfriend for five years; we got together after he and his wife mutually agreed to separate, and they have two daughters together. For the first year of our relationship we were under the impression that his ex would be leaving the country, taking the girls, and I would probably never even meet them. She advised him on the day of their departure that she was just going for a holiday and would be back in three weeks to continue living in the house they own.

For the next few years his ex refused to allow me to meet the girls, saying she didn't want them around my boyfriend's ""whore"", etc. I eventually met them and for about a year we formed a friendship, although I have no interest in children and don't want any of my own. During this time my boyfriend stayed the night at his ex's house a couple of times, and I saw them maybe six times.

A year ago, my boyfriend and I bought a house large enough for the girls to stay over, I bought them beds and they stayed a few times. Six months ago, my boyfriend got a raise, and the gov advised him that he had moved up some bracket and would be paying a substantial amount more child support. Even his ex agreed it was a lot and they organised that he would have custody of the girls one night a week. He only told me that he would have the girls sometimes and didn't elaborate. I didn't question it as, of course, they are his children.

I checked our calendar and the girls staying over had been added every second Saturday. The girls, now 8 and 5, were exhausting and messed the place up...okay. Then my jewellery started going missing, and my make up was broken and messy. The girls started stomping footprints onto the newly painted walls, rollerblading on the carpet, and hanging around in my study, playing with my stuff and yelling while I was studying. My boyfriend knows I am uncomfortable telling someone else's kids what to do, especially given his ex's feelings on me seeing them, but my boyfriend didn't tell them to stop until I would ask him to.

On their last visit, the 5 year old snuck off to my bedroom to bother my 15 year old cat, even though she has been told not to. I'm ashamed to admit that I knew she was in there, but it was late and I thought the cat could just take one for the team. When I later went in there, the cat was showing the whites of her eyes and flinched when the 5 year old spoke. The next day I picked up the cat, who started screaming. The vet said she had a ""tail pull injury"" and asked if there were young children in the house. My boyfriend denies the 5 year old did it, as she wouldn't lie to him.

Finally the stress of the situation got to me and I broke down and told my boyfriend the girls couldn't stay any more, at least not right now and so often, and I was willing to break up with him if that wasn't negotiable, which is true. He has agreed in the short term while we work something out, but I feel like an asshole for not letting his kids stay in his own house. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,3,2,3,Care,590

She is not originally from the country while i am and we are both 20 years old. About 4 weeks ago we found out that my girlfriend is pregnant which was unplanned and did not happen due to stupidity but through a medical mistake. we both agreed on an abortion. We have visited a specific clinic for a check up where they told us they can't do the procedure at the moment due to her having an low iron level and anemia so we got send away with the instruction to get iron pills and come back later. Soon after that the nausea related to pregnancy hit my girlfriend very hard. She already has been mentally through a lot and takes antidepressants to help her so soon the whole thing started being really tough not only physically but also mentally for her and she kept on saying that she can't bear this much [longer.So](https://longer.So) at one point she said that she will get an iron infusion to get her iron level up fast because she could not keep the iron pills down and we got an appointment for the clinic right after that to get the procedure. We went to her home country to see her GP who drew her blood and said that her iron level is perfectly fine. With this knowledge we went to our appointment which she had to attend by her self due to the health crisis. after the appointment she told me they didn't do anything and just tested her iron level and than said it was way to low and they would not do it.She started crying after that and while we drove back she did not talk and seemed to be in her own headspace. I was holding her hand whenever it was possible while driving to at least somehow be there for her. Shortly before we arrived at the point where we would pick up her mom she asked "" so what is the plan now?""

1,"AITA for ruining a first grader's drawing? | My son is in first grade. I don't get many opportunities to pick him up from school due to my work schedule, but yesterday I had off to take care of some business. I finished early, a little after lunch time and was bored. I wanted to surprise my son and pick him up early from school to take him to frogurt and the mall. We do Christmas 'month' in our house so we randomly give little gifts or do random nice things for them in the spirit of ""Christmas month"" for all of December. 

I go to the school, security measures have been stepped up like crazy and I love that, sad to need it but anyways, the front office lady wanted to call him to the office but I declined and said I wanted to walk into class and see his face when he saw me. 

Worth it.

He was super excited. Ran to me immediately. Big hug. Awesome shit. 

I told him to get his stuff as I was ""rescuing"" him from the rest of his school day. He sprinted back to his desk. When I caught up with him I could tell something was wrong. He pointed at the picture on his desk which was now covered in all kinds of stickers, smiley faces, a lot of pink girly princess ones, but over the drawing he had made of his family at the fair together and I could see how hurt he was. 

The girl who did this to him is not unheard of. We ask him how his day is everyday and not often but sometimes he'll bring up something (let's call her Sara) did that was mean spirited or kinda cruel. We always teach kindness and respect to even those who don't deserve it. 

So there Sara is, I swear to god in the most innocent but evil voice I've ever heard, asked him ""do you like it?"" while giggling. He shouted ""you ruined it!"" And she responded with a ""this was our present to you, we think it looks a lot better now"" and I pulled my son away as he was visibly losing his shit. 

I weighed the options immediately. Talk to the parents. Turn the other cheek. But then I thought no, my son is a fantastic kid, selfless, thinks of others, is always kind. What good would teaching him to just be bullied do? So I made the decision to get even. I told him how sorry I was and how I could tell it was an amazing picture, but to grab the sticker book. He looked up at me puzzled, got the big sticker book from its place in the class, and I told him to pick out his favorite ones. The plan was to originally put a lot on hers but her drawing was a princess, that took up the whole page, so we put one basketball sticker on her face that made it look actually really funny. Like Dwight with his head in the pumpkin. 

When Sara saw it she was furious and yelled ""why did you do that?""  -While we were walking out the room, I said with finality ""you shouldn't mess with anybody's things if you don't want them to mess with yours.""

After about a month I decided to ask her out and she rejected me saying she was dating someone. I took a few days to think about whether I could stay friends and eventually I told her I was fine with it (big mistake in retrospect).

As time went we've grown closer to the point of doing things which I feel only a couple would do like spending the whole day together, going over to each other's house alone, even going to a ball together. We even made plans to go only the two of us to a christmas market 3 hours away. I have also been really confused because aside from that one time she never gave any indication that she was with someone. She never mentioned anyone, didn't have pictures of anyone on social media, etc... which I think contributed to me letting this thing go on. Eventually this week, I overheard someone talking about her dating this mutual ""friend"" of ours and not much later I saw him groping her in the club where she told him to stop and seemed annoyed. I have never really vibed with this guy because he always does mean things like cut me off while I'm talking but nevertheless I can't avoid him as we have many mutual friends.

&#x200B;

This has confused me because she has given no indication at all that she likes him or is involved with him. At events they often don't even sit together, and have never made public displays of affection. She has never told me anything like that, and she doesn't appear to be particularly good friends with him (for example this term we have done all group work together, and he only joined one group because I suggested it, hoping to get on better terms with him)). In lectures she always sits with me not him.

&#x200B;

On the last day before the break, we were both going home I asked her if she'd wanna do part of the train ride together. We met up and who else but he was there too which she didn't mention. I ended up having no opportunity to ask her in person. In the end after I said bye to her I ended up texting her to ask her whether it was true to which she responded that it was and that she ""doesn't like to talk about personal things"", that she wanted to mention it to me since we are friends but that she doesn't like to talk about it so much.

After my daughter's passing my husband had an affair with his close friend which resulted in a baby girl Zoe. Now Zoe's mother was a troubled woman who suffered from post partum depression, which ultimately took her life. My husband was regretful of his actions and worked hard to prove that he was willing to be loyal from that day that on. I decided to forgive him and accept the baby as my own. 

Zoe is now 6 years old and is a bright young girl. I love her but one thing which has been bothering me a lot is that Zoe looks a lot like her mother. Somehow when I look at her face for too long, I get triggered. 

After the cheating, I've struggled with being intimate with my husband. Things improved in the last 3 years, and my husband had recently expressed his desire of having another child. He has been really desperate for a baby. Now all this time, I've taken pills in secret, however, I ended up conceiving 2 months ago on a family trip. 

I forgot to take pills one morning, and  ended up pregnant. My husband is beyond excited. He cried happy tears when I told him about the pregnancy.

 Zoe has been going all around telling her friends that she was going to become a big sister. My inlaws feel that this baby will finally heal our wounds. My husband talks to my belly all the time. He is being incredibly affectionate and loving. He gets emotional wherever he talks about the baby. 

Now the biggest problem is that I don't feel connected to this baby at all. Recently, an ex came into my life after 10 years. We have reconnected and our friendship is going strong. We often talk about our lives. He recently got cheated on and left, so we've talked to each other about our experiences. 

Things took a drastic turn for me last week when I saw a dream. In the dream, I had just given birth to my baby and my husband was there holding our baby in his arms. When I looked up to see my husband's face, I saw my ex. My actual husband wasn't there in the dream and neither was Zoe. 

Ever since I saw the dream, I've come to the realization that I no longer see a future with my husband. I do want a family of my own someday, but I don't want a baby WITH HIM.

On Saturday, I woke up aggravated and agitated. I have a history of anger issues and when I texted my GF in the morning I told her how I was feeling. She told me to take the day and we can talk later that evening. I was happy with that since I was afraid of taking my anger out on her. 

Well the feeling didn’t go away. I texted her later that night and thanked her for the space and we said our good nights. 

After that my week got worse. From Saturday to today I was dealing with more bad news on top of more bad news. I’m not going to get into the specifics, but it’s wiped me out. 

I know my girlfriend has trust issues, so for the first few days we at least said good night to each other and that was it. On the fourth day, she sent me a message saying she was worried about me and it would help her if I checked in so she knew I was alright. I won’t lie, my message was short. I said that my week was horrible and I want to be left alone. I personally didn’t think it was her place to be worried about me. 

The next day she only texted me good night, but I couldn’t even bring myself to respond to her. The next day she didn’t even send me a good night. 

Today I finally reached out to her and let her know I was ready to talk. She told me that while she was happy that I’m ready to talk, that she does not want to listen to it if it’s about the week I had. She said that she had a terrible week, but she couldn’t just hide away like I did. I live alone and she lives with her family of 5 others. I know she deals with huge stresses from them and being as she can’t go to work, she’s been overwhelmed. 

She said that she had enough to deal with and that I had my chance to talk to her about this stuff while it was happening. She said she needs to be able to deal with her own sanity, and my silence gave her an anxiety attack but she knew she couldn’t reach out to me when it happened so she dealt with it on her own. 

I told her she knew what she was getting herself into. I had warned her about this kind of stuff. I’m a bit mad at her for blaming her anxiety attack on me and I told her that’s not my responsibility. She got angry and we haven’t talk since. I’m debating if I need to apologize or not. 

Now I’m wondering if me taking that week to myself was an asshole move. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,3,Care,578
