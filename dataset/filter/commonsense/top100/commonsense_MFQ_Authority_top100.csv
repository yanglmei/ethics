0,"AITA for kicking out an autistic kid from my movie theater? | This one is a little interesting

A little backstory first.

I am a manager (m 19) at a movie theater, in a rougher part of a major Canadian city.

While cleaning a theater to prepare it for the next showing, a 16 year old looking kid came into the theater trying to find his hat. No problem, stuff gets lost all the time, and I know exactly where to look; (stuff almost always finds its way under the seats). The whole time we were looking, he was cussing under his breath, ""son of a bitch"" ""fuck me,"" to me it seemed a little excessive but i understand people get frustrated when they lose things. I would expect this reaction if someone had lost their phone, but he had only lost his hat. Anyways I find his hat (under the seat), he takes it, says thanks, and goes on his way. The hat was a black hat with a Dos Equis logo on it. After he leaves, I think to myself ""wow that interaction was weird,"" and go on with my day without thinking anything of it. 

fast forward about an hour

i was at box office when a guest informed me there was a disturbance by the vending machines. I thank her for informing me and start heading over there. Immediately I see a man throwing punches at another individual. I intervene and tell the man to leave now. He turns around (he appears to be a teenager) and very smugly chuckles and says ""oh thats my mom."" I say ""doesnt matter, you need to leave now."" To me it seemed like he thought he could get away with doing whatever he wanted to his mom, judging on his response. regardless, I was going to kick him out no matter what his response was. He requested to leave out of the front doors, which I thought was an odd request considering what had just happened. I said no and escorted him out of the side doors. He kicks the door on the way out.

I go to check up on the mom, she is okay but has tears in her eyes. Behind her is her younger son who was holding onto his eye and crying (he had gotten a black eye from his older brother). I ask if she is okay, she says yes, she says that her son is autistic and is 16 but has the mental capacity of an 8 year old. That explains it. She was completely silent from when i approached the situation, until I asked if she was okay, she had not said anything while I was kicking the kid out. Regardless, we give her a refund, a few passes and send her on her way (this took about 10 minutes from the time i asked her if she was okay). I apologized for kicking him out, saying that when I saw violence i had to act. She says not to worry.

After a few minutes I realized the kid was the same kid who lost his hat (i had recognized the hat). this explained his behavior to me. 

Fast forward about an hour, I was coming back from break.

As I walk in the doors, a fellow manager says to me that the cops are here, looking for someone. (he shows me a picture of the individual). its the kid. fuck. 

I go up to the cops, they asked for my story, I told them i saw someone throwing punches and kicked him out. They said he was autistic. I told them the mom told me until thereafter. They said not to worry, but that he had gone missing. 

Turns out that when i kicked him out he kinda just kept walking instead of waiting for his mom or whatever, and again, this is in a rough neighborhood. 

So am I an asshole for kicking out an autistic kid, leading to him going missing? I feel like perhaps I should have waited and asked the mom before kicking him out, but she never said anything while i was doing it. I have no idea what happened to this kid, and I feel really bad that my actions led him to going missing. Then again, I also feel justified in this situation because the dude was beating the shit out of his family, what else could I have done.

Am I an asshole?

0,"AITA for taking the belongings of a couple homeless men? | Backstory is a must so please hear me out. I work for a commercial real-estate company in Milwaukee as a maintenance man. I handle over 3 million square feet of property (mostly very old) along with my supervisor. One of our buildings has recently become vacant due to the previous tenant moving. Over the past few months we have had serious criminal damage done to the property resulting in a lot of calls to the local PD and beefed up security (cameras and barbed wire fence). 

About 2 weeks ago I make my bi-weekly lap around the building looking for more damage and checking cameras. To my delight I find nothing, at first. As I get to the back of the building where the railroad is, I notice a lot of new garbage. Mostly cheap beer and liquor bottles along with McDonald's wrappers flying around. I walk to where one of the service doors was spray painted and find a pile of blankets and more garbage.

It took me a second but I realized there was a person under the blanket. I wake the guy up and ask him if everything is alright. He goes on to say he's just trying to stay warm from the winter weather pushing in and he thought this spot was well enough out of the way as to not be bothered. I say not a problem, just so long as you clean up the garbage I'm fine with you staying here. I told him about the kids tearing the place apart and advised him not to stick around during the day, less the police or my boss find someone at ""the scene of the crime"" so to speak. He said no worries I'll clean up and be on my way. I think nothing more of it and go about my day.

A week later I do my walkthrough and what do I find but the same garbage, plus more, and someone else sleeping in the same spot. I wake him up and ask about the beer cans scattered around. He says none of it is his even though I see amongst his belongings are 3 more unopened beers of the same type. Slightly annoyed, I explain to this guy the exact same thing I told the other man. You can stay, please clean up. He says no problem I'll do it before I leave. I say thank you, and ask him if he knows the other guy that sleeps here. He nods and I ask him to remind him about cleaning up.

Two days later I come back to more garbage. Now I'm upset. When our buildings accrue an excess of garbage the city will give us a warning and then begin to fine us. I find the second guy and give him one last chance. I tell him to clean up or next time I'm going to have to involve the police. I find the first guy sleeping under a loading dock and explain the same. I told both of them I don't want to call the police but I can't just let you continue to stay here making a mess. Going on to state how if my boss found out I was giving them a second chance let alone a third, how I would be fired. Again the agree to clean up, so I leave.

Today I find neither of them, but the garbage and their personal items are still there. So as promised I call the non-emergency number and explain to them the situation. I ask them if there is anything they can do and they say it's out of their hands unless damage is being done. The tell me that I am allowed to remove the garbage/items. I wait around the building for an hour hoping to spot one of the homeless men, but nothing. It's at this point I make the decision to move all of the stuff inside our building. I came back to that building 3 more times throughout the day hoping to find one of them and return the items on the condition they don't come back.

I didn't see either of them, however their items are safe and I do plan on returning first thing in the morning. I feel terrible for taking their things but I can't risk my job. Especially after I gave them several chances and was very polite and sympathetic. AITA for taking their things?",False,False,4,3,2,5,2,4,Authority,755
0,"AITA for not letting my stepson’s mother see him while my husband is out of town? | 
My husband was married before me. His ex-wife announced to him that she had been having an affair and was running off with the guy. She signed away her rights to their kid (7 at the time) and basically said she didn’t want to see either of them again. We started dating after that and got married. It’s been nearly 5 years and we haven’t heard from her. 

My husband and I talked about her a little bit when we first got married. He said he didn’t really think we’d ever see her again, but at the time he was pretty angry with her for what she’s done to their son, so he said if they ever did see her, he didn’t want to see her. But again, that was about 4 years ago when it was still pretty fresh. He said he wasn’t mad for him and he thought that both he and his son were better off without her but he didn’t understand what kind of person would abandon her son like that and he didn’t want that kind of person around his son. But we didn’t really talk about it after. 

My husband doesn’t travel very often for work, but once a year, he goes to France for two weeks. I talk to him every day, but only about 3:00 in the afternoon (time here) because of the time difference. He works long hours and goes to bed pretty quickly afterwards, but he always calls me before he does.  Yesterday, his ex called at about 5:00 our time (12:00 in France) and told me that she had tried to call my husband but he didn’t answer because he was asleep. She got my number from her parents who still have a decent relationship with their grandson, so I have their numbers so they can see him. 

So anyway, she told me she’s going to be in town just for tonight and she was wondering if she could see her son. She said she would have called sooner but it was a last minute trip and it took her a little bit to work her way up to calling because she knew she’d made a mistake and she wasn’t sure we’d want to see her. I told her that I didn’t think my husband would like that very much and since he was out of town, I thought it would be best if she waited until he got back. I told her I would try to call him and ask, but he didn’t answer me either, so I called her back and told her to call back the next time she was in town. I told her I would talk to my husband and see what he thought when he was back in town but she said she wouldn’t be back for a while. 

I’m planning on asking my husband about it tomorrow when I talk to him, but she was pretty upset about it and said that she’s sure he would let her see her son and it was rude of me to not let her see him just based on something he had said four years ago. She said that I should have just as much right to decide who my son sees because I was in charge of him too and so since my husband was unreachable, I got to make the decision. 

AITA for not letting her see him? I know I’ve really only heard one side of the story, but she doesn’t seem like a very good person and I don’t want her to see my son without my husband present, even if she is his mother. Am I wrong?",False,False,4,3,2,5,1,4,Authority,634
0,"AITA For not caring about my father's cafe? | (Obligatory) Hi this is my first post here, I'm not from the US so if there's any bad grammar or mis-interpretations my bad,(also got a D for English). I immediately thought of this subreddit to come to and vent. (also am on mobile). This will also be very long. 

Some backstory: I've recently turned 16, and my brother 15, when father has recently opened up a cafe, and it has a rustic farmhouse theme, seeing that it is situated in an eco village, and next to a horse riding place (don't know the official word for it). Because of this, there are a RIDICULOUS amount of flies, and many, many rooster calls. The cafe also came with a small piece of land next to it, so he decided to make it a venue for hire for BBQs and parties.
He forced me and my brother to work there from 7 till 7 every day of the week, without a single penny paid to us. Seeing that we started our summer holiday, it was very convenient for him, and not for me and my brother.

Now for the main event.

It started yesterday, and it being a Saturday, I prayed for the 1% chance of me avoiding work, but you can guess how that went. I begrudgently went with my dad to work, and I really wasn't in the mood. At 12 o clock hayfever hit me harder then 911, and my sinuses were as fucked up as Hong Kong's situation. My auntie came over it visit us at work, and immediately noticed (she's like my 2nd mom) and told my dad I'm not fit to work. Like seriously, you could look at my red, snotty face for a split second and see that. My dad on the other hand WA having none of it, and forced me to continue to SERVE customers and wash dishes.
 That night people also rented out to braai ( our version of BBQ) and I was not prepared for that at all. I ended up to staying till 11 at night, in sandals, shorts and a t-shirt. I finally left because my aunt came to pick me and my bro up. (thank you saviot aunt). My dad was really pissed, but I didn't care.

So this morning my dad picked us up, I took some allergex, and we went back to work. After working and napping (like you in classwith your head on the table) till 12, we had lunch. My father told me to eat, but I was tired, so I said no. He warned me again, I didn't respond. 5 minutes later I got up and went to go eat. I cut me some French loaf, and went to eat by myself. Someone (my lazy cousins who visited) then cut for them and made a huge mess, crumbs everywhere, on the counter in which we served customers.
My dad got up, stood in front of it, and said that I must come clean it up NOW. I said nah, I'm busy eating. He lost it. He asked if I don't care that a customer can come in and see this mess, I said of course not, I'm busy eating. He kicked me out and send my off the premises.

0,"AITA for not wanting the sister-in-law to stay in my house | My SIL(from US, unemployed) wanted to come to stay with us for a few months in Japan. She demanded $1300 for flight ticket, passport and traveling from the airport. Of course we'll have to cover all her living expenses here too. I already had the horrible experience living with her mom in our house in Japan before, and ended up being homeless. So I strongly said no to her offer. Also, we couldn't afford her. They got frustrated saying that I was ugly about money, that all I care about is money, and that to me money is more important than family. I straight up told them they were being greedy and selfish, and she was not welcomed in my house. My words can be harsh when I'm pissed off. But I did not get angry for no reason. My husband pulled out from his credit card to send her the money. She came anyways.

Despite disliking it so much, I still opened our door for her and treated her nicely. She got her own room with mattress and warm blanket. I work all day and my boy goes to nursery so she had the house for herself. I only saw her about 3 hours a day, at most. I asked my husband to take her to places. I took her to a nice restaurant on the first day she arrived. I bought extra food and shared with her what I cooked. She was very quiet most of the time. It made me feel pretty awkward. She did help with the dishes and spent a little time with my boy. I said I appreciated for that.

Then on the 3rd day, she started acting out. That morning I heard my husband joking around about the coffee she was struggling to make. It was the first time we brought Japanese coffee so I got curious and asked ""how much was this coffee?"". Right after that she dumped out the coffee in front of my face, stomped into her room, slammed the door and started crying. She said that I hurt her feelings, and that I'm always concerned about money. I got pretty pissed off but did not say anything. Then, she came sit on my chair, talking to someone on the phone a lot about how ignorant I was, and that she got really frustrated of my behavior. I stopped her right there, told her she was being full of shit and this disrespectful behavior is not accepted in my house. She yelled back then left. Later she came back and cried to my husband about how she tried to run away from her dark life in US but when came here all she got was mean words from me. I stomped out of my room said everybody has their own problem but decent people would try to solve it themselves, not to bring burden to other people's shoulders like what she was doing. She jumped up and down and yelled back at me. We both blew up and threw hurtful words to each other. I asked her to get out of my house. She didn't leave. She apologized. I did not. I am pregnant and all the stress she brought is hurting my baby. I believed I don't deserve to be treated like that in my house. I think I have the right to get angry and react strongly.

0,"WIBTA if I kicked these girls out of the troop? | I am the leader of my daughter’s Girl Scout troop. The girls rank as “Juniors”, which range in age from 9-11. Before the end of the school year, we did a camping trip. I was setting up everything for the afternoon with the help of the adults, while we all made sure the girls stayed in the immediate area. We could see if they were going to try to leave bounds, but not exactly what we were doing.

After our first two activities, they have another break. I’m doing something with one of the girls when I hear one of the 10-year-olds we’ll call Sasha yell out “My iPod is missing!”

Now, iPods were not allowed on the trips to begin with, so I wasn’t sure why she would bring it. But I asked when she last saw it, if the other girls had, etc. One of the other girls said that they had seen one of the 9-year-olds looking at it, we’ll call her Megan. I said, okay. Talked to Megan, she hadn’t seen it. Okay. Sasha says she needs to find it or her mom will be so mad. I remind her I said don’t bring electronics and that I wasn’t responsible.

Sasha and her friends go into the tent shared by the 9-year-olds (Megan included) and some of the 11-year-olds. Suddenly, I hear them say “There it is!” I go in and it’s sitting in the front (mesh) pocket of Megan’s backpack. I call Megan in, she swears up and down that she didn’t do it, she would have no reason to take it and starts crying. I don’t know what to believe and I tell everyone they need to go sit down outside while I figure this out. 

I talk with the other adults. We agreed the story sounded weird. Finally, I asked to talk to Megan privately. Again, she swore up and down she didn’t steal it. She’s so upset. I get her to calm down and tell her that it’s going to be okay, she’s not in trouble. I have another adult stay with her to read for a bit while I talk with the older girls (out of earshot of Megan). I say that if this is true, then Megan will be going home and not spending the weekend here. The girls look smug. I then say “Oh, and because she’s clearly dishonest and not living up to the Girl Scout law, I’m going to have to boot her out of the troop.”

That got one of the girls looking upset and I knew my gut feeling was right. Suddenly, she was whispering to Sasha and I asked what was up. She said that it was all Sasha’s idea to get Megan in trouble, because there were too many “babies” on the trip. They had plans for the other four 9-year olds (that wouldn’t have worked). Sasha eventually owned up to it.

I called these girls parents and had them picked up early. I told the girls’ parents that they would not participate in any more GS events for the rest of the schoolyear (last two weeks). Now, it’s time for the new school year. Megan’s mom has recently said that Megan wants to come back this year, but only if the three girls involved in this weren’t. I know one isn’t.

0,"AITA for telling someone they can’t bring their emotional support dog into our bakery? | I work in a bakery as a barista. An older man and a woman and two women came in. As I'm helping the women, I notice the older duo has a dog. As I go to say, ""I'm sorry, but we can't allow animals in here,"" I see the dog has a vest and assumed it was a service dog. As I take the drinks out, the dog was standing in the middle of the café; the owners tried to get them to move but the dog didn't move, and I ended up spilling some of a latte trying to get around the dog.

I take their order, and as I'm walking out the drinks I notice they put the dog on the bench so its head is now on the table. Then I see on the vest that the dog is an emotional support animal, not a service animal like I thought. Now I have an ESA, and her letter permits her to go on airplanes and in housing, but not into businesses like service animals can. And in a bakery, it's a major health code violation.

Now I'm in a pickle. They have their food and are eating, so I ask my manager, what do I do? She says don't say anything cause they'll probably complain. I vented about how people can pay scam websites to get illegitimate letters and a vest and are promised you'll be able to take your pet anywhere, and how it makes it harder for people with service animals/legitimate ESAs to be taken seriously. She says that I can say something as they leave.

As they’re leaving, I say in my normal cheery customer service tone, ""hi there, I just wanted to let you know that ESAs aren't allowed in businesses, and I let it slide this time because I thought they were a service animal at first and you had already ordered, but if you bring them next time I'm going to have to ask you to leave."" She says okay and leaves. They stared into the shop as they slowly drove away.

Yesterday, she leaves a review saying it was her father's ESA and they were well-behaved (mind you, the dog didn't listen when asked to come)/clean/leashed, and she was looking forward to coming back until I was blunt and tactless. She said I had seen the dog before they ordered and said nothing, so ""maybe you should have told us that before we spent 30 plus dollars and tipped you."" Leaving out that I first thought they were a service animal. I didn’t do it for the sale, I was ready to ask her to leave as soon as I saw the dog, and frankly she can have her tip back. She said we didn't check up on them - something we don't usually do as a small bakery - smile, or make eye contact, the latter makes me feel shitty because I have anxiety and PTSD which makes eye contact hard for me. I made eye contact with them at least twice each; I probably could have been better, but I was flustered about there being what I thought was a pet, then a service animal, and then an ESA. Not really a good excuse, but I don't necessarily think good eye contact is an end all to good customer service. Other than that, my customer service game is pretty on point.

0,"AITA for getting my roomate's boyfriend kicked out and am forcing them to keep thier cat in thier room? | I moved into a shared student apartment a week ago. As our lease says, the rooms are single occupancy and animals are not to be kept in the common areas so I know I'm in the 'right', I just want to know if what I did was a dick move. It is also a female-only apartment.

I live with international students (relevant because of communication issues) who all know each other. At the time this all happened I only guessed they knew each other since it was hard to talk to them. At first, everything was ok. My roommates were clean, quiet and seemed nice enough. We didn't talk at all but that's to be expected with cultural and language barriers. It was hard to talk with them but I'm sure that went both ways.  Then, 2 days ago I went to leave the apartment and saw a ton of boxes and a guy in the house. All my roommates were hanging out in the living room talking, w/e. I assumed he was just a friend helping one move in. Later that night I heard hissing under my door. I left to check it out and realized that they had left their cat in the common area. This wouldn't normally be a big issue but I have a cat in my room (why I choose this unit since it was animal-friendly) who was hiding in my closet to avoid the hissing cat. This cat then spent the next two days hissing at me and the cat in my room. I was also worried because there are now claw marks on the couches in the common area which I would also be liable for since I also have a cat.

That night I was kept up by male voice until 3 am. That morning I saw the guy in the kitchen and was going to try to figure out what was going on with him and the cat. I said hello and he literally said nothing and walked right past me into the bedroom. I was overtired, feeling ostracized like I didn't even live there and a little panicky (I specifically chose a female-only suit over co-ed because living with guys I don't know makes me very panicky) so I immediately contacted the management.  Management sent out a letter and the next day the guy comes up to me and confirm that he lives with his girlfriend, that the cat is a 'shared' cat and that no one else cares that he is there or the cat is there. Well, I care and I told him that I have as much right as any other person (ie his friends) about what happens int eh common area. I then told the manager what he said and she got the ball rolling to have him forcibly kicked out next week.

0,"AITA for not waiting for my in laws when they were late to my wedding? | This happened a few years ago but it still plays on my mind a lot. 

I got married in a church in the countryside a few years ago. My husband's parents lived in the city and it was a 90 minute drive to the church from their house the morning of the wedding. I was really stressed leading up to it and they come from a different culture where weddings just start when everyone turns up and the time for starting the ceremony isn't as strict. I called my mother in law 3 times before the date of the wedding to discuss the start time and I even had a conversation with her about how the wedding needed to start on time because the priest had another engagement in the afternoon (I'm not sure exactly what it was, could have been anything from a funeral to visiting some parishoners, in any event, the priest was really clear that we couldn't start the wedding late). 

I called my mother in law again twice leading up the wedding - I offered her to go to my parents house beforehand and travel with them. I offered her to go to my husbands house and get ready there. I gave her a map showing where the church was. I asked them if they needed me to explain the directions etc. They declined all these things and said they were fine, they didn't need any help etc. I normally wouldn't have done this but I knew it was an area of the country they weren't familiar with and the priest was putting pressure on me about the start time. 

Anyway, day of the wedding: I turned up to the church. The church is full. All of my husbands family is there, the bridal party, my family. My mother and father in law aren't there. I'm standing there in front of the church, people just awkwardly looking at me from the pews, and everyone is buzzing around saying ""They're late! No one knows where they are! What are we going to do!"" Everyone is trying to call them but they're not answering. The priest is annoyed at us and saying that we need to start the wedding. 

I pushed back the start time again and again and managed to convince the priest to delay the start time by 45 minutes. Forty five minutes pass and I'm still standing around, no sign of them. My husband was freaking out and I said to him ""We probably need to start the wedding soon but they're your parents and you can make the decision whether we wait a bit longer or start."" He made the decision to start and we got married, his parents turned up just before we had the kiss. 

Anyway, people still think it was my fault they missed their son's wedding. His family whisper about it. His parents never once apologised to us. My parents still say it was a ""terrible"" thing that I did. I tend to think it's easier to make it my fault because I'm the daughter in law but this is still a whole thing 3 years later.

0,"AITA for not following OCD mums rules? | I (23F) moved out of my parents house in October but when the pandemic started they asked if I wanted to move back in temporarily so I wasn’t on my own. I was nervous about being isolated for so long (history of mental health issues and don’t cope well) so I said yes and moved in mid March. 

My mum has always ran her house in a very particular way. She has rules that, as kids, we always followed and never questioned because we just thought they were the norm. I.E nobody ever touches the curtains except her, washing up is always done as soon as you finish eating, cushions are never allowed to touch the floor etc. Now I know these things are really important to my mum. She used to have really bad OCD (would spend 6 hours a day folding towels until they were perfect) and she has got a lot better. Most things I do out of habit and aren’t an issue. But there are some rules that I am struggling so hard to follow and we’ve had lots of arguments about it. 

For instance, nobody is allowed to sleep past 9am on a weekday. I struggle getting to sleep at night and sometimes I’m up until 2/3 am. But she insists that we get up anyway even though we then have little to do in the day. Regardless of whether we get up or not, she always comments things like “you might be happy being lazy slobs but I don’t want to live like that” and is always making little remarks about our day. 

Eating is an issue. We have time windows as to when we can eat certain meals and if you miss it, you don’t eat. Like today, my parents are doing some work on the kitchen. I went in to make some toast but she said no as I would be in the way. I then went back when they were finished to be told no again because it was too late. Haven’t eaten.

We’re not allowed to do things that make a mess. To pass the time I brought some arts and crafts and puzzles home. But nope. Too messy. My dad isn’t allowed to get his DJ equipment out because she can’t stand the wires. Then we get moaned at if we just sit and watch tv. 

There’s other things like, doors and windows have to be open all day even though it’s cold, I’m forced to take medication I don’t really want. (I’m asthmatic and my mum insists an antihistamine a day will help but I never take them at home and I am fine) I’m always called to help out while my 19 year old brother does sod all.

0,"WIBTA for not giving my sister a share of my inheritance - to give to her daughters? | My father died last year. Beforehand he showed me the final copy of his will - it was simple, 50% to me, 50% to my half-sister. 

&nbsp;

I wasn't always close with my Dad (parents split when I was young) and as a result I've never been close with my half-sister. She's much older than me, we've never lived together and until last summer we hadn't seen each other in 10 years. She has two daughters, one of whom I've never met. At this meeting, she did mention she'd *hoped* Dad would give something specifically to her daughters, but I shrugged this off as I knew he hadn't and I assumed she must not have seen the will.

&nbsp;

A few months later and upon sorting the estate, I’m waiting for her to send me some documents, including the will, to sign. I message to ask if she's received them yet and if she can forward them to me. This message is the reply I get; 

&nbsp;

'*I need to talk to you - Dad did want to leave something to the girls but was too ill to sort!*' 

&nbsp;

Again, when shown the will and multiple times discussing it with him later, my Dad didn't once say he'd wanted to change anything. Asking for clarification, in genuinely as calm a tone as I write this post, stating that he'd been through the will with me beforehand, I simply ask what exactly Dad said he wanted to change? From seemingly nowhere I then receive this exact response; 

&nbsp;

'*Hang on! What's your problem with this? I don't want the money it would go straight into the girls account. I'm surprise you are even doubting it!!!! Think about it, Dad loved my girls and wanted them look after. I spent a lot more time with dad so had more opportunities to discuss this. He even had their bank details in the care home but I could ask him to call the bank as he was too ill and too tired. Fucking hell, are you for real?!*' 

&nbsp;

Asking her to calm down, stating all I ever did was ask what Dad said and how much he'd wanted to give to them, I eventually get clarification that they never discussed specifics - 'he just said he wanted them looked after'. Happy to provide my messages word for word in the comments if need be, I'm just aware of going over the character limit here.

&nbsp;

Despite not being close with them and not having even met both daughters, as someone with no children of my own, I had previously considered offering some of the money as extra to them. But due to being largely kept out of the loop of funeral organisation and in the end only being told about the burial of the ashes literally less than 48 hours beforehand, I realised as we really aren't close, that's not my concern and if that's what Dad *really* wanted, he'd have included it in the will in the first place. This latest exchange just cements that feeling.  

&nbsp;

0,"AITA for calling my school principal out on BS? | I go to a private christian school and we have a 15 minute period between classes called “chapel time” 3 days a week. Typically it consists of either singing a hymn or a bible lesson or both. 

On this particular day we were handed out a new song and for some reason I ended up with all the extras (probably 50 extra sheets.) I asked the people on either side of me if they wanted to keep passing the stack but they said no. While the papers were being passed out the speaker (who happened to be the principal that day) started his lesson on the meaning behind the song. 

I still had the stack of papers and nowhere to put them so i set them on the floor. The principal continued speaking while i was setting the papers on the floor. Anyways after a couple minutes i got more settled and my head was facing slightly down, as this is the most comfortable position for me to sit in. I should mention i was still listening to what the principal was saying and i wasn’t being distracting. 

While i was looking slightly down i hear the principal stop speaking and go “Is there a problem?” I didn’t know he was talking to me so I didn’t even move my head up to look at him. Still, the room was silent so after 5 or 10 seconds of nobody talking I finally looked up to see what was going on and sure enough, he was staring right at me. I was confused as to what was going on so I said “No, I was just looking slightly down but paying attention.” 
He continued speaking. 

I thought that that would be the end of the story. But about 15 minutes later I get called to the office. The principal sits me down and tells me that my response was very disrespectful. He said I should never talk back to an adult but rather just be silent. I replied by saying that the way he worded the question made it seem like he wanted a response. 
He then says “you also disrupted the whole school and made me stop to discipline you.” 
I responded by saying “You are the one who disrupted chapel time by stopping the whole thing because I was looking down instead of up.” 

I then asked him why he thought I was being a distraction. He said that I was not giving him my full attention and it was obvious because i was not looking at him. 

I told him that out of the many kids in the chapel room, I was not the only person who was not looking directly at him while he was speaking. 
I proceeded to tell him that I thought he was overreacting and misusing his authority. 

He kept insisting that my response was unnecessary and that i should never ever talk back to authority, and I kept insisting that there was no way my behavior was inappropriate. 

Eventually he gave up trying to debate me and we both agreed to think more about our actions before we do them. 

So my question is: Am I the Asshole? Did I go to far in trying to argue with a figure of authority in my school?",False,False,2,4,3,5,2,3,Authority,562
0,"AITA for Watching My Co-Worker's Career Burn When I Could've Stopped It? | I (30M) work using the end-products from my co-worker, let's call her Sammy. When she's unable to do her work, or gets it wrong, I end up being unable to do my work or at least unable to finish it completely because it's missing things from her.

Now, I have the skills to just fill in the missing parts, for example, if she forgets to add an order for our client, I can just do it for her. However, she's relatively new to the job so I figure it's better to tell her she forgot something, and show her how to do it so she won't repeat the mistake later on.

BIG MISTAKE

The interaction is brief, like 5 seconds. This is the first time I've ever corrected her for anything.

Me: Hey Sammy, when we get this request from our client, you have to add this order in.

Sammy: Oh, right...

I hand her the request, she fixes it, and gives it back to me later. No big deal.

Later on, at lunch, my buddy tells me she's been talking shit behind my back. I figure that sucks, screw her then.

Afterwards, she seems to be learning her job well and doesn't make many more errors. The PROBLEM IS she's still talking crap about me behind my back. I have different people telling me to:

1) Leave her alone OR 2) People telling me she's talking crap behind my back.

I go to her and ask if there's anything she wants to say to me. She says no, I ask if she's sure, she says yes, I say alright then.

The shit-talking only intensifies, and apparently I'm harassing her at work now. Drama ensues, only a few people are sticking by me, which kinda makes me sad but at least now I know who I can depend on.

Now comes the day when I see she makes a small mistake but could lead to a large inconvenience for our client. Nothing that would destroy lives but would delay our client's schedule and would make them very unhappy. This mistake went past her, her co-workers, her supervisor, and apparently nobody noticed the problem before it got to me.

So... I send an e-mail to her supervisor about the issue, which is standard protocol but the supervisor is gone for the day and they should (but don't) bother reading their e-mails after they leave.

The next day the client personally shows up and asks about this issue because he arrived in the morning and his people can't get to work because they were missing critical components for their operation.

Our boss smooths things over, gives them a discount on the order, and promises to take care of it himself. The client is satisfied, and leaves with no fuss.

Boss finds out Sammy was the one who made the initial error and fires her, everyone else gets warnings except the supervisor, who said she read my e-mail and was trying to fix the issue. Boss leaves, supervisor thanks me for catching the problem (she probably doesn't realize I could've fixed it myself since it's not actually my job to, and everyone else was too scared to say anything).

0,"AITA for being short with my neighbour after he let himself into my gated backyard? | This literally just happened and I'm still kinda ticked. For context, I'm an early 30s woman who lives with my boyfriend. I'm frequently home during the day while he's at work. The neighbours in question are backyard neighbours, so the back of their backyard runs along the side of our backyard. I hope that makes sense. 

Soo I was just getting ready to take a shower, was undressed under my housecoat and grabbing a towel from the linen closet when I heard knocking at my door, followed a minute later by the doorbell. I wasn't expecting anyone, and in my current state of undress I didn't feel comfortable answering the door, so I ignored it. 

I was about to head to the bathroom when I saw a couple people coming down the driveway. Halfway down the drive we have a gate that we keep shut, latched and locked whenever we're home. It's over 5 feet tall and super awkward to unlatch/unlock from the outside. So I watch their figures through the closed curtains walking up and down the drive a couple times until they give up and leave. 

I got dressed then because I was like, Wtf is going on? Not five minutes have gone by, when I open my front door and see no one, no cars. But I see the front gate was left opened. I go over to close it, because we keep all gates closed so that our dog can roam freely, and see that the back gate is still closed. 

So I head back inside when I hear a far-off *Helloooo?*. I've got pretty sensitive anxiety and it just spiked at this point. I head to the back door and see someone standing there. It took me a moment to figure out it was my neighbor. He was very jovial, told me he was trying to get a hold of me because they had the cable guy over and he wanted access to my backyard. I was like, ""Fine, whatever. Bye."" But he kept asking if something was wrong, and kept pressing me when I tried to go back inside. 

My dog ran out and with the gates being open I called him back inside, and my neighbour continued to press me if there was anything wrong. I snapped and said, ""Yes! I was getting in the shower and then there were people running all around the house. I didn't know what was going on.""

He got really offended and reiterated that they weren't *in* my house. I said, ""No, just letting yourself through a locked gate and coming to the back door instead of waiting at the front door and ringing the bell again."" I closed the door and he let himself back out the gate, and the cable guy never even came in the backyard. 

I'm feeling a bit jerky but also like, no. His wife came and left after ringing the bell. He then took it upon himself to come back, not even attempt to go to the front door, but let himself into the closed yard when I'm home by myself and hadn't answered at the front door?

0,"AITA for not asking my father to walk me down the aisle? | Throwaway for personal reasons.

I (27F) am engaged, planning to get married to my partner (30F) of 3yrs next year. Since I came out as bi (when I was 15) my dad hasn't been supportive of me. He was upset when I first told him about my fiancee & has made it clear he doesn’t approve of me being with a woman. He’s v distant when I take her to my parents’ home for dinner, won't talk to her when making conversation at the dinner table. When my fiancee isn't around he's made a lot of subtle cutting comments about her/our relationship despite me telling him to back off, he makes it v clear in general that he doesn’t see her as family. Basically he's been casually homophobic my entire life, you know the type. He's not providing any financial support for the wedding & when I asked if he would actually be attending the wedding he just gave me a snide ""we'll see"" so I honestly wasn't even expecting he would turn up.

Part of our intended wedding ceremony will involve me being walked down the aisle & given away, I enjoy a lot of the classic wedding traditions & that's one I really want to carry out. I assumed my dad wouldn't want to walk me down the aisle, tbh I don't want him to either, so I asked a male friend (58M) instead (1 week ago). This man has known me for almost half my life, he's like a mentor to me & honestly has been more of a father figure to me than my actual dad has, I love him like a paternal figure. We met when I was 16, he was teaching an acting class I signed up for (we both work in theatre). He's provided lots of emotional support over the years & been openly supportive of my relationship from the start. He has two sons around my age & has said before he sees me a bit like the daughter he never had. He said he'd be honoured to give me away.

My dad learned of this fact recently, I’m not sure how. He's FURIOUS, he says I’m undermining his authority as a parent & making him look like an asshole/fool to everyone who attends the wedding & if I insist on going through with this he won’t attend at all, there’s no way he’s going to sit at a table & watch some other man give me away. He's pissed I didn't ask him. After he said that I asked if he would have said yes, he dodged the question & yelled at me & eventually hung up on me.

I admit I didn't consider asking him & I honestly didn't see the need to. I guess it'll be embarrassing for my dad if he comes but considering his behaviour towards me & my fiancee over the course of our relationship I don’t feel like he’s justified to make this demand.

0,"AITA for having my deaf-mute neighbours' dogs removed from the neighbourhood? | AITA for having my deaf-mute neighbours' dogs removed from the neighbourhood?

My parents and I live next to a deaf-mute couple who own two dogs. In the past we had no issue with them, but our neighbours have allowed their dogs to bark all day for HOURS ON END. Naturally due to the neighbours' deafness, they cannot hear their dogs barking and it simply continues....

When the issue first occured, we left a note in their mailbox politely explaining that my brother and father work jobs that require them to wake up early in the mornings and the incessant barking was becoming an issue. A week went by and we received no response, yet the barking continued. Eventually my mother contacted the father of the deaf-mute husband and explained the situation, his only response was to laugh and tell my mother ""your husband and son should just use ear plugs or sleep in different rooms"".

My mother decided to contact the local council about the issue. After about two months, the council issued a formal warning. The barking continued....

My mother contacted the father again abd explained our situation, the father explained in an irritated manner that ""the dogs are there to help his deaf-mute son and wife with their daily activities due to their conditiod, and that we should just put up with it"". We were confued, surely there is no need for their dogs to incessantly bark like that though? 

Eventually we sought mediation from the council, and the council ruled that one of the dogs be separated and live at the father's property. The neighbours were not happy but complied for a while.

This brings me to the present. I am starting to get fed up with the fact that the neighbours seem to pay no regard to us or the official warnings issued by the council.

So I took matters into my own hands.

Unhappy with the fact that the father neighbours are so inconsiderate and seemingly thinking that this issue is a big joke by laughing at us whenever they see us, I contacted the father myself this time. I explained to him that the barking has continued for months now despite our complaints, and how his son laughs whenever he sees us, I gave him an ultimatum.

They either adhere to the official orders ruled by the council, or I take the matter to the court. This did not sit well with the father, as he decided to abuse me over the phone calling, my family horrible people, stripping his disabled son and wife of their right to have dogs.

I filed for the court proceeding and the magistrate ruled both dogs off the premises as it was quite clear to her that the dogs were merely pets, rather than aids, as there was no paper-work to prove such a thing.

While we are happy with this outcome, we still cop abuse from the husband and dead-mute neighbours occassionally....

0,"AITA for wanting to wear an specific blazer to prom against my parents will? | Ok so basically I (17F) want to go to my prom with a suit because i think they look super good on women and i deserved it because this year has been rough. I even had a blazer bought 2 years in advance, but my parents hate it with a passion. 
We went to look for cocktail outfits and my mother and I liked some tight pants and a top. I tried it on with my blazer and I liked it, but the trousers seemed off (they were emerald green, the top was white and the blazer was black). We went back home with both things, but I was unconvinced with the trousers. 
We arrive at home and my mother tells that to my father. We see the photos I took with both the blazer and without it. At first, my father tells me that we just need to find an emerald blazer. I even volunteered to pay it with my pocket money, he said it was not about the money.
However, they both started making comments in front of me about how I was looking like a manager if i wore a blazer, along more harsh comments. They laughed in front of me while they were saying that.
I'm quite the self-aware person and seeing the people that are supposed to care about me say those horrible things about how I looked in my dream prom outfit overwhelmed me. I had a breakdown and went to my room. While I was at the room, my mother told something to my father and then he spent all lunch telling me that I only leech money and food off them, and that they weren't going to pay for my college tuition (they know fully well how much i want to go to another college to spend less time with them); suddently it was about the money and they were using it against me ('we paid for the two parts so you don't have anything to say'). I decided to say nothing and stormed to my room as soon as I finished lunch. 

I know this sounds super edgy and a basic white teen problem, but I feel so bad about this situation. I'm used to my parents being volatile and pulling out those manipulative tactics, but now I'm turning 18 in a few months and i feel like this situation is... Wrong. It's my prom, and I should wear what I want, right? They have known about my suit plans since I bought the blazer when I was 15, and they have always chose my clothes against my will. Can't I have at least one opportunity to dress how I want to? They have spent a lot of money in those two parts, but they don't want me to pay for anything anyways, even if I tell them to.

I told her that I'd still have to think about it, because I can't come up with an answer on the spot. I also told her I need to know the details, to which she said ""like?"" and I told her that's for her to tell me because she's the landlord (details would obviously include prices for rent, internet, gas, water and electricity bills, how much I would chip in for general shopping items, etc). 

Before she told me all that, she decided to tell me her household rules. They included the following: no eating or drinking (unless using a bottle) in the bedroom, no mess in my room, can't go out every night (need to stay home some nights), I can't bring guys home (I can only sometimes), my friends can't come over regularly, I'll need to chip in with her dog cleaning chores, I'll be the driver if we need to go shopping, and I need to cook the meals if we're having the same meal.

After reading that, I was like wtf. I told her I won't be moving in somewhere to be parented, if I want to bring guys home I will, I won't be loud though because I'm considerate that others are in the house. If I want to have a friend over, I don't need to ask, and I can eat whatever I want to, etc etc. She goes to me ""is that how you think it works everywhere?"" To which I said yes. 

I'm a law student, so I sent her some laws that showed what she's asking of me is illegal, as she'll be my legal landlord and having those requirements aren't legal for a landlord to ask. While rules are obvious, every house has them, the general gist of the laws where I live are as long as your not damaging the property, as long as you're paying the rent on time, there's not much else a landlord can require of someone -- they can deny anyone living there for whatever reason, but they can't tell you what you're allowed to do in that space. Sorry if I'm not making sense, I'm tired. It's obviously not the same in every area or country, but that's how it is in the area where I live.

She wasn't impressed, and started to ignore me. But I wasn't having it, that's why I sent her some laws about what she's doing.

The service is similar to Life360 but just gives location updates. They also have me text when I’m leaving and when I’m arriving anywhere, which is quite honestly a drag when I’m with friends but it is what it is. For background I’m a 17 year old high school senior with straight A’s and also take a couple college courses (at my parents request) on the side. I will also be turning 18 before I go away for college. My parents claim they only use the service when they feel worried about my and my 20 year old sister’s safety. For my sister, my mom says she only checks the location at night when she is walking back to her dorm or is out doing something. It amazes me that she is okay with this.

At this time, I allow the service because I am not an adult and have little to no pull on them (ie when I had to argue with them for years about my 9 o’clock bedtime until they finally removed it this year), however I told them that once I go to college, I will be turning off the service on my phone. This was met with a very negative reaction. My parents argue that if I have nothing to hide, what’s the harm. They also argue that if I’m somewhere and I need help, how will they know where to send police. Their evidence for this is the countless hazing cases in frat culture, which I have no intention of joining.

To me however, I view this app as 24/7 stalking and a violation of privacy. This app is absolutely ludicrous and makes me feel very uncomfortable, not because I plan on doing anything illegal or dangerous, but simply because I don’t want to followed and monitored because it not only degrading me to the status of child, but also shows that my parents don’t trust me. Furthermore, it comes off to me that my parents are being control freaks who are not willing to respect my boundaries. In case it is important, when we last had this argument, they said if I didn’t keep the service enabled on my phone then they will be cutting me off, to which I replied that was counter intuitive, as it would prevent me from calling them for help in the event that I actually needed it.

The problem started about four months ago though. All of a sudden, we have both sides of our family butting their noses into the wedding and giving their opinions on everything... We even have some weird triangulation where I’ll address something with my future mother in law, and she’ll text him to try to convince him otherwise. 

The worst of it though is my mother. She’s always been my best friend. The problem though is she’s super assertive and takes over anything she works on. With my wedding, she’s decided that she wants to buy all the booze, that we should have custom water bottle labels (which neither my fiancé nor I care about), that we now need a day of coordinator, that we need to plan for what people should do between the ceremony and reception, has started bringing on herself to plan these things and more. 

Sometime we talk for 45min straight with her just telling me what we should do for the wedding. I get 2-3 words in. It’s started happening that if we say no, she gets incredibly upset. We only want a simple wedding, but she keeps making it bigger and more complicated, plus tells us stuff that we want is silly and will confuse people. 

I’ve noticed that when we get into these conversations, my heart starts pounding really fast and I start feeling super anxious— to the point I’m getting nightmares of her telling me everything I have to do in my life and that I don’t have enough time to do it all. I’ve woken up in tears from it. I start feeling overwhelmed when we are talking and then I snap and say something like “Mom, you aren’t listening to me. I need you to stop. This is too much.” This offends her to the point she yells or cries.

She’s dealing with some bad work issues and feels unappreciated there. When we don’t use her ideas or tell her to back off a bit, she feels her help is unappreciated for the wedding. I feel like she’s having a bit of a mid-life crisis of not feeling needed anymore. Last night, she told me that she wishes I would have just eloped.

I don’t want my wedding to break apart this close bond my mom and I have always had. I’ve dreamed of my wedding since I was a little girl. Now, all I want is to marry the man I’m in love with.

I tried beef once when I went to a fair with some people for a trip. My whole group wanted burgers so I didn’t want to contest because I was shy to tell them. I got really turned off from veggie burgers because the last few I had were so bad. So I got a regular cheeseburger. I bit into it and the first bite felt like a whole new world of taste. Like I’ve never felt this before. But I was sad since this was one of the few opportunities I got to try it. I had bacon once in Mac and Cheese at a hotel for a band trip and that was amazing too.

Now, I have absolutely nothing against getting a job. I've worked a summer job at a restaurant for the past 4 years, so the idea of me getting a job/working isn't one I'm worried about. The problem I'm having is that they want me to get one right now, just to completely fill me schedule. 

They know that I am going to be working full time this summer, and that I want to get said job. I've tried talking to them about letting me finish up school, which are going to be wrapping up in 3 months, but they constantly say that my schedule needs to be completely filled. They constantly talk about how they when they were younger, they had both school and jobs, and they were completely fine, but from my point of view, I'm not them, and I can't really tolerate that kind of 24/7 schedule.

Over the past week, we've been fighting a lot over this. Anytime I try and talk to them about it, they pretend to be understanding, but then completely ignore anything I'm saying, and our conversations go nowhere. They constantly say that if I don't get a job, they're going to kick me out, (I'm 18, they can.), which will prevent me from going to college this fall due to being homeschooled. 

Honestly, I don't know what to think about either myself or my parents anymore, and I feel like there's nothing I can do. The only thing I want to do is finish up my school before I put anything else on my plate.

0,"AITA for asking my Dad to put on a sweater or a blanket instead of turning up the thermostat? | I’m fully aware of the role reversal here.

I’m 22 and I live with my parents. I pay rent for the room, as well as half of utilities, grocery bills, and taxes. As far as I know, my parents are happy with me living with them since I help pay the bills, help maintain the house, and they get to see me all the time. I thought there was no tension there, but I suppose maybe there is.

It’s winter and it’s been getting quite cold. I noticed that the bills for oil have been skyrocketing. My parents’ house is big, has all old (20+ year old) windows, and cathedral ceilings, so it’s never been cheap, but it’s way more than anyone should expect. 

Over the past few weeks, I’ve also noticed that the house has been roasting. I went and looked at the thermostat those times, and it was set to 80+. My Mom did not do it, so it had to have been my Dad. These times the house has been hot, he’s been on the couch wearing boxer shorts and an undershirt. I feel like this is very wasteful, so I went to talk to him.

Me: Hey Dad, I’ve been noticing you’ve been turning up the heat a lot.

Dad: Yeah, I’m old now, I get cold.

Me: Yeah, I get it, I’ve been cold too. I’ve been thinking though, maybe we could do a house policy where we could put on double socks, sweaters, and pants, and maybe try blankets, before turning up the heat. We could save some money.

Dad: A house policy? I’m sorry, whose house is this? Is it yours? Or did I buy it?

Me: I’ve been paying half of the bills and rent, I think I have some say.

Dad: If you buy your own house, you’ll have a lot of say.

Me: If you’d like me to move out, I will.

Dad: That’s not my point. Just mind your business.

I told my Mom I was considering getting my own apartment, but she argued me out of it, saying my Dad is old and needs help plowing the driveway (true) and it’s winter/holidays so I won’t have good luck with apartments anyway. She told me to consider my Dad’s age and try to give him some slack. I told my brother, who agreed, saying that it’s my Dad’s house, Dad’s thermostat, Dad’s rules.

0,"AITA for calling the cops on a gas car in an electric charging spot? | I had to drive 1.5hrs to a specialist vet for my dog. I drained the battery in my electric car I found 3 charging locations near me, 1 at a mall, 1 at a AAA business center thing, and 3 was at a local cafe. 

The mall was all being used, AAA was broken and when I pulled up to the Cafe there was a gas Audi parked in the spot. I googled my states law and it states:

> Florida Statute 366.94 Electric vehicle charging stations
(3)(a) It is unlawful for a person to stop, stand, or park a vehicle that is not capable of using an electrical recharging station within any parking space specifically designated for charging an electric vehicle.
(b) If a law enforcement officer finds a motor vehicle in violation of this subsection, the officer or specialist shall charge the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle in violation with a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as provided in s. 316.008(4) or s. 318.18.

I was stuck waiting here since I didn’t have enough to get me to the next one (which could be broken or in use) and it was the only one working since AAA was broken and not just busy. 

I called the non-emergency line to complain, I even asked two workers if they knew whose car it was, they didn’t know.  I waited in the closest spot hoping police or owner of said car would do something. 

Cop shows up comes over to me an says “There is no law for this so why did you call me?” I showed him the above quoted statue and he says “I have to look this up.”  He goes back to his squad car and the owner comes out yelling at me that it’s his car and he paid $1500 to install that and if he wants to park there he will and I need to get off his property or he will hit me with trespassing. Now I have to pay to park and charge in that spot, this was not a free charge while you eat/shop kind of thing. Cop comes out to say that I am right, it is illegal to block the spot and he also cannot ask me to leave because I am paying for the spot and I have a contract with ChargePoint the actual owner of the charger. 

So AITA for this? The owner did not get a ticket for parking in the spot because the cop felt it was “up to his discretion” to decide if he violated the statute. ",False,False,3,4,1,5,1,3,Authority,449
0,"AITA for continuously reporting my colleagues mistakes, resulting in one coworker being so stressed she had to take a leave of absence? | I'm going to try and keep this kind of fuzzy for anonimities sake. I'm a nurse who works in a community setting - I see 10+ patients in a day, some for woundcare, some palliative (symptom management for those with progressive illnesses through end of life until death), and anything inbetween. I have 6 colleagues that I work with in a day and we each have our own area that we cover. 




The backbone of nursing is good documentation. Without it you're at risk of losing your license. It's drilled into our heads since day 1 in school, and is a very basic component and expectation of our job. 3 nurses I work with are negligent in their assessments and charting. They don't complete weekly wound measurements (the gold standard to ensure no deterioration occurs), they aren't ordering supplies for their patients, and they aren't completing thorough assessments. 



At the start I gave them gentle reminders about best practice, and offered constructive criticism on how they could improve. This didn't work, so I gave feedback to management (omitting names) on what I'm noticing so it could be discussed at our meetings. After numerous reminders and emails sent out over the span of months (by management) with no improvement I sat down frustrated, as their negligence resulted in more work for me and adverse effects for patients (as specific as I'd like to be.. But there were a few serious incidents where patients became upset to the point of tears as a result). 




After months of leeway I've started reporting any errors I catch directly to management including the name of the nurse. They finally listened, and sent out an email saying continued negligence will result in nurses being reprimanded up to and including termination + mandatory reporting to the nurse regulatory body in our province. This week I caught a TON of errors from one nurse in specific. Some smaller stuff: No wound measurements, not fully completing an admission chart, not ordering supplies on specified order days. Some bigger stuff, too: no vitals taken or a thorough pain assessment done (on a complex palliative patient.. There is no excuse for this), not answering patient page outs, etc. 




This eventually lead to this nurse having her first written warning in her employee file. I overheard her crying today, saying she's going to take a stress leave. I feel like I'm the cause. Yes, she continuously didn't complete basic tasks of her job, however I feel like a tattletale.

0,"AITA for letting a customer stand outside in rain and 42 degree weather? | I work at a small vitamin store. We're very small so, other than Fridays and Saturdays, myself and the manager work alone. We open at 9am but we get to the store between 8:30-8:45am to print the reports and get the store ready for open. Today I managed to get out of the house a little early and got to the store with enough time to sit and unwind after the reports were printed, which is rare; I'm usually rushing to open the door because our ancient IBM POS is super fucking slow.

Anyway, I got to store around 8:20 and got the reports printed by 8:35, blocked/faced my shelves and then went to the stockroom to sit for a few minutes and have a drink, eat some of my breakfast. The weather here is absolutely abysmal today; stinging, pouring rain, high-mile winds, slight sleet, just freaking awful. We're in North Carolina and right on the coast and way south, so this weather is somewhat unusual for us this late in the winter season.

Around 8:50 I heard someone banging on the front door. We still had ten minutes to go before opening. I'm not technically allowed to let people in before our posted hours but my boss told me it was my discretion. I went up and cracked the door and asked why they were banging. Guy says he'd been standing out there for about thirty minutes, which was a big fat fucking lie because I'd have seen him while printing the reports and blocking/facing my shelves. I told him that we open in ten minutes and I'd let him in then. He asked me did I expect him to wait in that weather for another ten minutes. I reminded him that no one forced him to wait outside and he could have easily waited in his car. Then I shut and locked the door and returned to my breakfast sandwich.

I unlocked the doors promptly at 8:59 as usual, hit the lights, and waited for my customers. The guy had left and so far hasn't been back. I know from a rulebook standpoint I'm in the clear, if hours are posted and no customers allowed until such time; but from a moral standpoint, was I an asshole? I mean, other than being ten minutes before opening the store was ready and the POS was ready for transactions, I just didn't feel like handling a customer before I was mentally prepared.

We plan on having it at a local church and then having a bonfire party on the beach. My MIL and aunt soon got involved and kept telling us how we need to change the wedding. Aunt said we can’t do it on the beach because her cousin (who i met once when i was like 7 and barely know) is in a wheelchair and can’t access the beach. She invited like 100 people i don’t know or barely know and half of whom already decided to come.

MIL invited 200 people to come, half of whom are coming over from Ukraine and i assume don’t speak polish or english so idk how tf thats going to work out. My fiancee doesn't want them there either.

The people I work with for the most part aren’t rich but do well enough so they can afford rent and have some disposable income. I also have some clients who are flat broke and save for months just to hire me. 

This one rapper, a single mother who is gaining a following hired and paid me $500 to shoot a show. I had her sign a contract which clearly states my refund policy (must give a 72 hour notice for a full refund, 2 days for half refund and less than 48 hours is no refund and you must pay the entire amount agreed upon if not already paid upfront. This applies for any reason) 

This woman canceled on me the day of the show because something was wrong with the venue (I called and verified, they had an electrical problem).  She told me she wanted her money back. I was sympathetic and told her I wouldn’t refund her because I could have booked another event that day but I can give her a discount on the next show. 

She flipped out. Basically said “fuck the contract” and that I need to have sympathy and think of her child and that she could possibly be getting evicted from her apartment and has been eating ramen noodles for a month.  

Now I hate being guilt tripped. She signed the contract, knew what she was getting into and knew my refund policy. I don’t think I should have to forfeit $500 for the sake of a child that I have nothing to do with because of something that is not my fault. 

Now she’s saying she’s gonna take me to court (she won’t even have the time to try filing the suit) Her friends are spamming my Instagram with angry comments and I’ve even gotten some threats of violence. 2 other potential clients said they’re not gonna hire me anymore because I won’t sympathize with a single mother.

0,"WIBTA If I stop letting my siblings use my gaming set up? | Ok, so before I start here is a bit of background. I got my gaming set up for my birthday mainly because my siblings didnt let me play what once was my Xbox. I got it about 4 months ago. It cost around €700 for the monitor, PC, keyboard and mouse.

At first when I got it I was the only one to use it, with my father also knowing the password incase I searched up anything suspicious. My brother (12) and sister (9) begged me to let them play but I decided to not share the password in hope that my dad wouldn't give into them either.

About a month passes up until I come home after a night out with my mates to see my brother playing a game of mine on my set up, luckily, nothing was ruined, however I was extremely annoyed that my dad allowed him to play the computer.

I had a chat with my dad and he assured me that he'd only let my brother play when I was out with my friends.

I reluctantly agreed to this, however only because he made me feel bad if I didn't, something alot of people do to me as they know I hate disappointing others.

This continues up until about 2 months ago where it seems he is getting addicted to it and begs me to play it even if I am using it. I told him to f*ck of and get his own, which led to me being banned for a week and he got to play it all he wanted.

The week ends and I come back to a very laggy gaming set up. At first I though it was because it was cheap for a gaming set up, then considered it was possibly because my brother downloaded an apk of some game. In the end it was neither.

You see, during this week, my dad told my sister the password and she downloaded the one thing that f*cks up all computers. Roblox.

For anyone who isn't aware, this game causes alot of lagging when downloaded even when it's not running.

And thats how te problem was created I would ask my father if i can go hang out with my friends and he wouldn't let me, mind you these were reasonable requests i would ask to go hang out with them at 3pm and i would promise to be back by 6pm but he still wouldn't let me, my friends arent a bad company either none of them do drugs, they don't smoke and they don't even consume alcohol frequently, etc. So in order to spend more time with them i started lying i would say im going to the library but wouldn't tell im also meeting with a friend, or i would say im going on a ride with my motorcycle and i would park at my boyfriend's house and hang out with him, just stuff like that. I would do this maybe once or twice on a good week.

However, the family that lived above me moved out and was shortly after replaced by a young (mid 20s?) couple.

But since then, every time I walk by and anyone's on the patio they'll ignore me when I wave, and whenever I go on the patio while they're out there they immediately go inside (sometimes even when I'm not even going out to smoke, it's like they just don't want to be around to even risk it).

So it seems pretty obvious to me that the smoking bothers them, since our introduction was so positive and everything since has been really strange and icy.

Today, I had just come on shift when one of my associates came back to the office to tell me that one of our regulars had come in and she was acting strange. She looked like she was falling asleep/phasing in and out of reality, and she had been walking around the store for like 30-45 minutes. This particular customer comes in fairly often, and she isn’t always the most polite customer, but she doesn’t cause trouble. She was in full uniform and obviously completely trashed on some sort of substance. 

I learned from the morning supervisor that this customer had been passed out in her car in the lot all morning and when the morning supervisor had checked on her to make sure she was okay she drove off. This was the second time she had been to the store today, but she hadn’t come in before. 

We let her leave the store because we can’t hold her if she doesn’t do anything wrong (like try to steal) but as soon as we saw her getting into her car we took down her plates and immediately called the military dispatch center. We notified them of her behavior and let them know that she was driving under the influence. 

They immediately dispatched three or four cars to try to intercept her, but it turns out she didn’t get very far. Trying to get onto the nearest freeway ramp (which we can see out our store windows) she ran right into a pole.

0,"WIBTA For going to a temple without my wife | Hello reddit! I'm an Indian American (26M) and a Hindu who got hitched to a white woman (24F) not too long ago. She's an atheist and honestly I couldn't care less. I'm not too religious either and religion rarely comes. I don't really want to ""convert her"" or anything like that and we've already agreed to just let our kids choose whatever they want.

Anyways, we're visiting my grandparents in India and I wanted to go around and see some famous temples. I took her to a few, but there's on major temple left. I don't want to specify which one for privacy reasons but from the way I'm describing it I don't think it'll be too hard to figure out which one. Anyways, this temple only allows Orthodox Hindus entry. I've always wanted to visit it.

An argument started between me and her because she says that she wanted to go too. I explained to her that this wasn't possible because she was not a Hindu. She said she could ""pretend"" to be a Hindu for a short while but I told her I would not be comfortable with that as it is against the temple's rules. The place is meant for spiritual connection and she just wants to see the architecture. She got pretty mad and went on a rant about religion before ""giving in"" and saying that if she couldn't go I shouldn't either.

I think this is ridiculous. I've always wanted to go to this temple and I'm allowed entry. She just wants to ""admire the architecture"", which is fine for most temples, and she's gone to plenty with me already, but for a temple which explicitly bars her from going she should follow the rules. As for her argument she's accused me of being bigoted and intolerant for supporting a temple which does not allow entry to non Hindus. I don't find anything wrong with this as it's explicitly a Hindu place of worship, but that's just my opinion

The housing market is terrible in the city I live in and it's nearly impossible for young people to buy a property. I managed to find a place that needed a lot of work done and I bought it as it was in a perfect area.

I paid the deposit in full, the mortgage is in my name and I spent close to a year supervising or doing the work to make the house liveable. My money, blood, sweat and quite a bit of tears have gone into this home. My GF on the other hand did not contribute anything to the house and doesn't believe/want to buy a house and is fine with renting a place forever. Furthermore she's not good with money so any savings she had are quickly spent. 

I moved into the house earlier this year, before then i was living at home. We discussed living together and I offered my GF to move in with me for free, she immediately asked whether her name would be on the deed and I said no. I have no problem with her living there for free but I've read too many horror stories of couples that have bought a house together and then broken up. Neither side budges and a house sale gets forced, I don't intend to sell my house.

This led to an argument where she said something along the lines of me ""planning for our break-up"".

My younger one however is the rebellious and problem child that loves to wrangle out of my control.

At around 11 or so we found he discovered the dark side of the internet, and since then we've put parental controls and time restrictions on the computer. the doctor recommended limiting screen time and exposure because it could have negative health effects.

This worked well for a while, but then multiple times he found a way around the filters and kept violating our rules of usage, and used the computer at night.

Everything went well for some time, until I checked the browsing history and found that he had violated the rules again, and was now going on troll and skeptic/atheist forums that perpetuate misinformation and aren't good for him.

This was also the time where he got his first gaming computer that I got from my coworker's son who moved away to college, so before giving this to him, we made sure that he couldn't bypass our restrictions. We put Windows controls on it that can't be bypassed. He also must fill out a form that logs his hours and what sites he goes on, because now there is a zero tolerance policy.

1,"AITA for making my daughter stay with me during my court appointed time? | So, according to my Ex and my kids I'm being the unreasonable one here for acting like the only adult in the situation.

So, I have 3 kids with my Ex. My daughter (16) and my two sons (14 & 9). I won't go into details about our divorce or relationship now. Just know me and my Ex don't get along at all. Looking back now, I don't know what I saw in him at all. But that's irrelevant. 

Me and him have 50/50 custody. We're supposed to switch weeks with them. But recently my daughter has decided that she dosen't want to do that anymore. Over the past 9 or 10 months she has insisted on spending more and more of my time at my ex's. It started with her just wanting to spend a day or two extra over but now i'm lucky if I get a full week with her a month. I've tried to be respectful and understanding (she has emotional issues). I've tried to talk to her about this multiple times but she just gets snippy and refuses to talk to me at all. My ex is no help at all (as usual). I've tried to get him to help me understand but he just tells me that it's her choice and that he will remain out of it. 

Like I said, i've put up with this, even with the huge headaches it's caused. Recently though, my sons have also started to show interest in spending more time there as well. Well, last night I finally put my foot down. 

My daughter finally decided to come over to my house, but when she came she said that she wanted to spend ALL her time with my ex. She no longer wanted to stay with me at all. I demanded an explanation but she refused. She claims that she's ""old enough"" to make this choice and that she feels better living with my Ex. 

Well, I refused. I've been much more understanding then i've been required to be. I've let her break the court order for almost a year but i'm done. I'm done letting her and my Ex disrespect me. So I told her that from now on she's following the schedule again and I wont let her spend more time at my ex's than required. 

Well, she melted down. Called me a bunch of things that if I had called my mom I would not be here today. And locked herself in her room. My oldest son said I over reacted and I almost got into an argument with him as well. 

She still won't talk to me and left quickly to go to school this morning. My sons both are also now being cold to me. I got a long winded text from my Ex as well calling me all sorts of bad things and saying i'm an asshole. I talked with my sister about it as well and even she says I'm being a pad mother.

1,"AITA for denying my wife a new kitchen? |  

Married for 8 years. 3 kids - aged 3 to 8. We live in a large 1980's house. When we bought it the plan and my promise was to completely refurbish. We've done about half the house - thoroughly, but not too much in the last years b/c of lots of work, small kids.

My wife now insists we refurbish the kitchen. The kitchen is now over 30 years old, originally very expensive but now shows its age. It is totally usable though, and in my eyes it's not that bad, though I agree it's not what we really want. But I don't want to fix the kitchen, not unconditionally.

She has a low income job, I'm high income. She works 70%, I work well above 150%, many evenings, weekends. I pay 90% of our bills from my salary. The new kitchen will cost $100k+. This will be all up to me to pay. We've had a few rounds of redecorations earlier, with contractors, and even though we didn't do much of the actual work ourselves - all the things like making plans and detailed decisions, dealing with contractors, buying materials, etc - I had to do it. She prefers to distance herself from these projects, just wants to ""get it done"" but doesn't want to be very involved in the ""doing"".

Furthermore, I've developed this feeling that she doesn't really deserve a new kitchen. She has no real interest in cooking dinner - and thinks that I should be the designated ""gourmet chef"" in the house. Dinner is usually just thrown together in 15 minutes. She has recently turned vegetarian, which I - a meat lover- is decidedly unhappy with. But even these new veggie meals are usually just the same goop as before - minus the meat. I can hardly remember 2 occacions where she made a well-planned and tasty meat meal for me. Otherwise, her dinner priorities is it has to be quick, for the kids, for her, and I just have to eat with my mouth shut.

So I've told her that she's not getting a new kitchen unless something changes. I want her to gain interest in cooking. I want at least once a week a meal of my liking. I want the purpose for a new kitchen to get better food, not just something to show visitors. I want her to more involved in the project itself, not just showing me pictures from magazines. Things like editing work plans, find serial numbers for items I must buy, and actually talk to contractors herself and not just through me.

She oppose this. Says I owe her and promised her this kitchen. She does most of the cooking anyway (I make dinner 2 times a week), and if I'm not happy I can just cook more myself. She must have something in return for all working nights and weekends where she has been left with the kids alone, and that I act like a Scrooge. She feels unempowered since I have veto on major decisions. Since I'm paying this and has to see it through, I feel it must be done on my terms. 

We have a decent marriage, but this kitchen conflict has become sort of locked.

1,"AITA For refusing to help a colleague after they've messed up | So I work in the service industry and I've been with the same company for the last 4 years. I work at an event center where I collect dirty glasses, stock up bars and help out customers with everything they need.

We employ a lot a young people, think high school age. They work fridays and saturdays and rarely on  weekdays if there is a bigger event.

This season, a new girl, along with a couple other people, was hired. I'll call her Kate. Kate is 17 and she tries really hard. She's great with customers, always has a smile on her face and you'll rarely hear her complain. Genuinely just a nice, hard working kid.

Now there are a lot of unspoken rules. Certain things have to be in certain places, even if there's no obvious reason for it, that sort of thing. We tell every new hiree about all of the rules and I make sure they know they can always ask if they need help with something.

Recently, we started to notice certain things misplaced. We had a short meeting with all of the staff and I tried to get them to admit who it was. Not to punish them, but to explain why it had to be the other way. No one admited, which was fairly disappointing, but whatever. I explained the reason anyway, but we continued to find things in places they shouldn't be. I planned on setting up a meet with each of our staff individualy, hoping to resolve the issue.

Yesterday, Kate came to because she couldn't find a crate of quite expensive wine (think $150/bottle). I told her to look where the wine would usually be, but it wasn't there. That's when she said she put the crate elsewhere the day before, because she tought it would be more accesible there, but that it isn't there anymore. I asked her where she put it and basically she put it where we put empty wine/alcohol bottles at the end of shifts (she didn't know this, because only me and another guy take out the empty bottles as we stay longer than everyone else).

Now me and my boss reviewed the footage and indeed, it showed her putting the wine there and 6 hours later, me and the other guy, collecting all the crates and taking them out (we stack them on a cart, so we didn't even notice the crate was heavy.

Now he wants her to pay $1500 out of pocket for the 10 bottles. She asked me to talk to him and explain that she didn't mean to do it. I told her I was sorry, but we had told every single staff member where things have to be placed and she still did it her own way, therefore I couldn't do anything to help her. She broke down crying.

My girlfriend thinks I'm an asshole, says that I could've talked to my boss and maybe work something out, such as take a portion of the money out of her paychecks every month. My friends are mostly on my side, though some are saying I was a dick even though she sort of deserved it.

Background: I homeschool my children. They do a lot of world schooling and they do very little ""sit down work"" much of their school work is very hands on and interactive. We use programs outside of school hours as part of our school instruction and take every opportunity as learning. On a whole they do much less work than other kids their age so when I tell them to do something I expect it done. 

My 9 year old is obsessed with books called The Magic Treehouse and we went to NYC today so she could see the author and get a picture with her.

Her younger sisters came with us but were not as interested and excited as she was.

During the program they asked the kids to practice writing a story and said for those that can't write they could draw a story. I told my 9 year old she needed to write (she HATES writing assignments. She will write her own comics all day but screams and throws a fit with assigned writing. 

She started to pout and stomp during the program that she was not writing and she was drawing a picture. I told her she would regret it and that no matter what she would be doing writing today so please do this project now. She refused and sat there with her arms crossed. 

As I suspected after the writing time they allowed kids to stand up and read their story to Mary Pope Osborne. My dd started crying yer eyes out and rushed into writing 2 horrible sentences and wanted to raise her hand to read. I put my hand on top of hers and said ""no you did not do the work you rushed through this and have something incomprehensible you will not be reading now""

She started wailing. Not just crying but sobbing loudly.

I took her out and warned her to get herself together. Sent her to the bathroom to wash her face and told her she had 5 minutes to get herself together. She continued to cry louder. So I picked up my other children and we left. She was screaming crying on the way out about not getting a picture with the author.

I felt so torn. On one hand I could have just let her read her thrown together 2 sentences. She would have been happy and no one would have said anything. On the other hand she refused to listen and do the work in writing something even when I as her teacher/mom told her to do it 4 times and I don't feel bad work should be rewarded.

1,"AITA for ""publicly slut shaming"" one of my coworkers for her inappropriate outfits? | I am a female teacher who has taught at an all boys school for what will be twenty-eight years at the end of this year. There are only a handful of other women who teach here and the majority of us are in our 50s-60s. The other younger two are both obese. So for the most part, inappropriate attention from students really isn't an issue- I know that sounds weird but it's something you have to look out for. You have to watch how you interact with students, how you dress, etc. 

This past fall, for the first time in five years, a new female teacher joined us. I'll call her J. J is 27, fresh out of college and very beautiful. However, she dresses very inappropriately for work: short dresses (above the knee), tight pants/skirts, low cut shirts, etc. It's not shockingly provocative, but it's obviously inappropriate for work. At first, some of the cattier women at work immediately jumped on her and constantly began making rude remarks towards her. I figured they were just jealous, so I took it upon myself to befriend her. I also figured someone would eventually speak to her about her outfits, so I kept my mouth shut. However, a the semester went on, her outfits got increasingly more provocative, so much that we all noticed.  And of course with this came more snarky comments from coworkers and students beginning to talk. 

I ended privately speaking with my boss, M, about the way J dresses. M is not a subtle guy and does not usually take people's feelings into consideration so when I spoke with him I made sure to explain that this was something that should be handled privately and delicately. He seemed like he understood but the next day during lunch when we were all on the same lunch break, M proceeded to tell J in front of everyone how inappropriate she was dressing and that it reflected poorly on our school. J left in tears. When it came out (and I don't how it did, but it did) that I was the one that reported her, all the female teachers accused me of slut shaming J because I was jealous of her. I found this sort of funny given how they had been treating her. The male teachers seem to be on my side, however. It's completely split between guys and girls.

I don't whether or not this was the right way to have handled this- it was the most professional way I could think of. It was not my intention to embarrass J but I did feel that her dressing the way she has wasn't appropriate for school- especially being around teenage boys all day.

About a month ago I was a restaurant with my husband of ten years celebrating his promotion at work. About halfway through our meal, a couple was seated at the table next to us. She was wearing a white dress and veil and he was in a suit so it's pretty obvious that they just eloped. They also looked extremely young to be getting married, but that's their choice so I didn't think much of it. My husband congratulated them and they thanked us. They seemed very nice until I couldn't help but overhear the bride say to the groom something along the lines of: ""Hey, do you mind ordering my drink for me?"" 

This struck me as odd as most grown adults wouldn't ask someone else to order for them. The groom nodded and the bride got up to go to the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom, the waitress came and the groom ordered two beers. Something still seeming off to me, so when the bride returned and I asked them how old they were. She is 19 and he is 21. So, she obviously isn't old enough to drink so he's buying it for her. After watching them have a few more drinks, I decided this wasn't right. Call me old fashioned, but I am very against underage drinking as it can do so much damage and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with that. I know people who have ruined their's and other's lives over this and so when I see it happen I do something about it. So, I reported it to the hostess who then came over to ask the bride for her ID. The bride said she didn't have it on her. They went back and forth for about a minute and it ended with the bride admitting she was 19. The hostess then asked them to leave as they don't allow people to drink underage. The hostess was gave me a dirty look and my husband asked if I had said something. When I told him I had, he got pissed off at me and said it was none of my business to say something. I think I did the right thing as the bride shouldn't have been drinking underage and if she really wanted to drink they could've waited a year to get married. Besides, it's incredibly selfish and wrong to scam a restaurant that could also suffer major consequences for this.

He is very clearly mixed with pit bull and that, combined with his size and color, makes him look intimidating. He’s never hurt a soul, not even our 9lb cat, and he’s well known in the family as a clumsy, excitable oaf. He positively loves children, especially our 8 year old. The worst thing he’s ever done is lick people’s faces. Our little one is generally not as excited about pets and takes time to warm up to them. We’ve trained her to understand that he is a member of our family and she is to be nice to him. He seems to understand this about her and shows his love for her in less intrusive ways. She was sick with the flu last week and any time she was laying on the couch with a blanket and watching TV, he was laying next to her and would not move until she got up. 

Anyways, we had extended family over for Christmas Eve. My husband’s uncle has a 5 year old daughter (Alexis). Alexis is visually impaired but wears glasses and nobody treats her any differently for it. This family doesn’t come over often, but when they do, Alexis screams at our dog whenever she sees him. It starts the moment they open our door, because the dog meets everyone at the door (normal dog stuff, imo). My husband helps calm the dog down while they get in and get situated, but her mistreatment of him doesn’t stop. Every time he enters a room, she screams at him to go away and waves him away.

I get that he’s scary the first time you see him, but she seems to be more scared each successive time???? My dog does not deserve to be screeched at just for existing. IMO, she is disrespectful to my animals (family members in their own right) and my home and part of training our kids to be successful adults is teaching them how to behave outside of their home.

I’m in a 55 year old lawyer (female) and I need some clarification about an incident that recently occurred between my daughter (21) and her roommate (also 21). They are both in their senior year of college. For story’s sake, we’ll call my daughter Melody and her roommate Claudia.   

When they moved in together at the beginning of the semester, my daughter and I decided to make a roommate contract for them. My husband and I make the monthly rent payment, and Claudia is responsible for sending us her half of the rent. We asked early on that she send it within ten days before the end of the month to make sure everything’s in order (she has been very good about sending it on time, even over holiday breaks, though she has been two days late a few times).   

The roommate contract was not only to make sure rent was paid on time but also to outline cleaning duties and ensure the comfort of both Melody and Claudia. Here’s where things got sticky. Claudia has a boyfriend and Melody told me he’s been staying over at their place a couple nights a week. Melody and I were both uncomfortable because if she needed to leave her room when he was staying over, she’d have to pass Claudia’s bed behind the divider in the living room and would sometimes hear him/see him. Because of that, I drafted up an addendum to the contract saying that he could only stay over a maximum of two nights a week including weekends and that Claudia had to inform Melody at least a few hours before he came over.   

I thought this was completely reasonable. However, one week ago Claudia had her boyfriend over four times (DOUBLE what the girls agreed upon). Naturally, Melody was extremely upset and called me sobbing. I decided the only fair thing to do was to terminate Claudia’s part of the lease a month early. I gave her two weeks to move out, which even then felt too long knowing my daughter’s discomfort. She also left the bathroom disgustingly dirty (multiple times)!   

I’m posting because Claudia and her parents have all reached out to me asking for more time. The girls’ lease isn’t up until March and Claudia isn’t moving into a new place until then, also she claims she is taking the LSATs in just a few days and needs to study. Her family lives several hours away by plane but my daughter said Claudia’s talked about an uncle in their city, so it’s not like she would be out on the streets.

She has become rebellious and complains about her life, whatever her friends do she couldn't and stuck at home because she has no money and had to clean the house like an old wife. She also said that her mother would not like how I treated her and would complain to her. I warned her not to, my wife is troubled enough without her daugher giving her more.

However, this is her first year in the high school portion of the school. The high school admits a lot more students who aren’t necessarily religious, and my daughter got mixed up with some new girls who are bad influences. She’s gotten in trouble at least once a month this school year for improper uniform, like rolling up her skirt so it’s too short, untucking and unbuttoning her shirt, taking off her blazer, wearing too much jewelry or makeup.

This past weekend, I gave her the punishment of having to wear the proper uniform all weekend. We just did our normal routine over the weekend. We ran errands, we went for a walk, we went to church. I even treated her to brunch after church. She didn’t want to go to brunch while wearing the uniform, but I reminded her that this was her punishment for failing to wear the uniform properly at school. I even agreed to let her go to her friend’s house, as long as she wore the uniform, but she ultimately decided not to go since she didn’t want to go out with the uniform anymore. She got a couple of questioning looks while we were out, but nobody really said anything. One woman at church said it was nice to see a teenager so formal at church, which I think embarrassed my daughter, but that was it.

1,"AITA for arguing with my wife over the fact that she keeps breaking our children's stuff | We have two children; a boy (Jay) and a girl (Leah). These are obviously not their real names. Jay is 12 and Leah is 15. So, let me start this off by saying that me and my wife live a very comfortable life. Basically, we've worked hard our entire lives and got promoted till we got to this point where we make enough money to support a ""lavish"" lifestyle. I'm merely mentioning this because I believe that this fact is the core of our problem.

What I mean by that is that our income is giving some leeway for their mom to break their stuff. She often breaks their stuff when they misbehave, spend too much time on them or get bad grades. Now I believe that there should be some sort of punishment for when these stuff happen. Taking their stuff away for a while would be an okay punishment. However, breaking their stuff is extreme and wasteful. Moreover, when I say their stuff, I'm talking about Leah's phone (which costed a hair over $1000) and Jay's latest gaming console.

Lately, Jay and Leah have been doing a lot of things that irked their mother. So, yesterday their mother had reached her boiling point and she smashed Leah's phone by throwing it full force at the floor, and she cut Jay's PS4 cords. I suppose that Jay's predicament was far better than that of his sister, mostly since their mom didn't know how to break a PS4.

I was out when she'd done all that. My kids told me once I arrived. I was annoyed. However, I stood by their mother's side and basically defended her actions. Once we were alone, I told her that she should stop breaking stuff. 

She said that they deserve it and should start listening to her if they want to keep their stuff. I told her that she could've just taken them and hidden them somewhere. She said she didn't want them to have hope of having it back anytime soon. Basically we've argued on and on for an hour or so and haven't reached any compromise yet.

1,"AITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me? | I know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. 

My wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. 
While I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.

Her parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.

I thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.

The real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels ""good enough"" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?",False,False,2,3,4,5,1,2,Authority,420
1,"WIBTA if I only give my son a toy gun for his birthday? | Okay so, my son turned 17 Wednesday and we’re having his birthday party this weekend. On the day of his birthday he asked to go hang out with his friends and go camping. It’s summer so we said yes. 

A little back story before I get into the AITA part: 

My son isn’t biologically my son. His father died when he was very young (6ish) and his mother was unfit to raise him. My husband and I took him in and have been with him ever since. He was generally an excellent child. He’s given us endless joy and happiness. Recently though, he’s started to act out. At first it was small. Breaking curfew, lying, hanging out with questionables. We tried talking, because he is a straight A, chess club, football, beta club all around good kid. 

It didn’t work. We tried grounding. Screaming. Listening. You name it we’ve tried it. His misbehavior is only escalating though. He was caught smoking weed. (I know weed isn’t huge and I’ve always been open about that conversation but clear that he was expected to stay away until he was 18 an adult to make that decision.) He was involved in a hit and run. He was caught stealing. 

This catches us up to our story now. In the middle of the night I get a call from the police, again. This time, our son was caught tagging an abandoned house and had taken my husband’s revolver from the safe. 

He was charged for the gun and released to us. The officers were really great to us but I wish they wouldn’t have been so cool in front of son. 

I was livid and screamed at him, took away all of his privileges, anything I could think of and he still is treating it as a joke. He told my SIL that he thought it was all funny. 

I’m really confused and hurt, son and I used to be so close. The three of us all have always been very close. Husband and I feel as if our trust has been completely destroyed and that we’re losing our son. 

The question is, WIBTA if for my son’s birthday I give him a toy gun, plastic hand cuffs, and other gag gifts as a “low life” starter kit to prove a point?",False,False,4,3,4,5,2,3,Authority,402
1,"AITA for telling my spouse that girls belong in the GIRL Scouts and boys belong in the BOY Scouts? | M(49)  military veteran reared in the south asked my spouse F(35) reared in upstate NY her thoughts on the recent ruling that girls could participate in the boy scouts.  For clarification purposes,  she was in the girl scouts.  I was not in the boy scouts. I tried to explain to her last night after hearing the news of girls being allowed in the boy scouts that I no longer feel comfortable encouraging our young son to participate in the boy scouts now that girls are allowed in the boy scouts. It seems like common sense to me. Girls go in the girl scouts,  boys go in the boy scouts... hence the name GIRL scouts and BOY scouts.  Her explanation was that she quit the girl scouts because they didn't do cool stuff like the boy scouts and she feels as if girls should be allowed into the boy scouts.  I explained to her that the coolness factor she spoke of was merely her perception as a bit of a tomboy as a youngster. In addition, while yes it is pretty cool to become an eagle scout, this coolness factor needed to be addressed in the higher management of the girl scouts and not just solved by blurring lines and pushing the girls that want to do cooler stuff  into an organization that is already taxed by other recent changes and guidelines that are due to affect boy scout membership in a not so positive light. She assures me that my thinking is outdated and antiquated and that boys these days don't care if girls are in the girl scouts. I, on the other hand,  view it as a matter of principle. I love my spouse dearly and am trying hard to understand her point of view simply because we she be a united front, but I just am having an extremely difficult time getting past this very basic premise. I would truly appreciate views from males and females of all ages with or without  experience in the girl and boys scouts and will take all opinions under advisement, because as of the time of this posting, I'm still salty about our difference of opinion.

1,"AITA for refusing to sign a form saying a trainee completed her hours, because she refused to follow my instructions? | I’m an EMT. Sometimes I get assigned a trainee, who has to do a certain amount of hours satisfactorily to pass their class. I had a trainee yesterday who was totally new to this, this was her first time ever riding with an ambulance, so I said clearly that she should be listening to everything I say and following my lead. 

We went to do an inter facility transfer for a guy who was basically just really sad and depressed, so a transfer from the hospital to a mental health care facility. I warned the trainee that I don’t like to talk too much to the mental health patients because they can be really unpredictable. I told her to just sit in the back, far away from him, and let him rest/sleep. We loaded him up and we were driving, and after he answered some of the basic questions and we were sitting, he was just talking to himself about how the roads are bad and he used to live in another state that was warmer and with better roads. The trainee, against my instructions, started talking to him about living in the state. Yeah, the guy was pretty harmless it turns out and they just had a little friendly discussion, but she went specifically against what I told her to do. The rest of her work was fine I guess, but I spoke to my partner privately about how she refused to follow my instructions and could have put me and herself at risk. Because of this, both me and my partner refused to sign her form saying she’d completed the hours.

I got a call from the training academy that runs her program. The guy said there was no harm in what she’d done, she was really upset, and couldn’t I just sign off so she could pass her class? I said no, that I wouldn’t be letting that go, she’d disobeyed instructions that were for her own safety and it didn’t bode well for her future career.

She looks a lot younger than she is and sometimes the supervisor gets on her for things that aren't really a huge issue, but I think she is talking town to her because she looks like she is a teenager. I told her that she should dress older, which she did and the boss started talking down to her less. Anyways, yesterday she was supposed to print out a memo she had written and she accidentally misgendered a client in the memo (who is trans). She caught this typo shortly after printing out the memo and putting it in everyone's box. She panicked, ran down to the mailroom and frantically pulled all the memos and then reprinted the memos and replaced them in everyone's box. Instead of just telling the boss, she did all this because this lady is exceptionally hard on her and she was afraid she might lose her job for this small mistake. The only person who had taken the original memo out of the box was another young girl and she ran to this girls cubicle, asked her for the memo and replaced it with a new one and asked her not to tell the boss, which this girl promised not to. At lunch she went to staples and bought paper to replace the paper from the memo so the boss wouldn't catch all the missing paper. I thought it was kind of dishonest, so I told the boss what happened. The boss reprimanded her in the meeting in front of everyone and this girl started crying and left the office for the day. The other girl who know the problem came up to me after the meeting and told me I was an asshole for reporting her to the boss, and said the typo was not a big deal and she said I should have known the boss would have an unreasonable response and that this girl was just trying to save herself from this issue.

I made a joke (probably not well received) and basically said, ugh why do we have to do probability. My teacher did not seem at all provoked by this comment so I thought he took it as a joke. I finished the worksheet pretty fast (it was simple work) and I raised my hand (nothing else). He came by my desk and I said I was done. Once again he seemed unphased, and he walked off after saying ok. Almost immediately he turned around and said he will check my answers. He looked at my worksheet and at almost all the problems he simply said ""no"" to. He put my worksheet back on my desk and walked off, seeming somewhat irritated. I looked over all my answers and they all seemed correct. So I raised my hand again to ask him. He came by and I asked him about a specific problem. This one I actually did mess up because I didn't understand it. I thanked him for the help, and then asked him about the other problems he said no to. They were all right. He then sort of screamed at me saying ""I just looked over your answers as fast as you did them."" He then called me rude for acting bored and lazy in his class and for making fun of the work. He walked away, and I was kind of stunned. I didn't think i did anything wrong. He came by my desk at the end of class and told me we need to respect each other. I apologized, as I saw how my joke could have been negativly interpreted. He wouldn't listen to me. I didn't do anything with malicious intent but it could be my fault still.

Every morning, I have her take a couple of dollars out of my wallet for lunch money. In the last few weeks, several times I have noticed that I am missing a little bit more money than usual.  So, this week, I planted a 20 dollar bill before my daughter took her lunch money out. Sure enough, she took it.

I called the police and asked them to come with me to the school so that we could teach my daughter a lesson. Two officers met me there and we pulled my daughter out of class, after which she informed one of the officers that there has been a bully who is stealing her lunch money/forcing my daughter to buy her lunch.  She also has been buying lunch for one of her friends who can not afford it. This was confirmed by both the bully, and the friend.

My daughter was silent on the way home and i informed her that I was just trying to teach her a lesson, that stealing is wrong and can get you in a lot of trouble. and that in the future she needs to speak to myself or her mother if there are issues at school and we would be happy to help her resolve them. 

When we got home, my wife absolutely lost her shit on me, in full tears, telling me that this is a one way ticket to estrangement from our daughter in the future and that we should have just asked her why she was stealing money.  She would have just lied about stealing in the first place so I really don’t understand what her idea of a solution is. 

My daughter apparently told my wife that she is terrified that her bully will now retaliate, and also that she may have lost her friend for bringing so much attention to her financial issue. She apologized for stealing and said she just didn’t want us to intervene.

1,"AITA for giving my sons extra gifts to charity? | I had a birthday party for my son last weekend.  He just turned 6.  I made it clear to everyone invited to just bring themselves and no gifts.  We live a very minimalistic life and I absolutely hate clutter.  My son has too much as it is and it gets to be a real pain to clean up after.  Last year I adopted a minimalist lifestyle and donated a good chunk of out belongings to Salvation Army.  I’ve been open about living this way with all the people in my life. 

Of course I got him a few things, but that’s really all the extra stuff I wanted to add to my house right now.  Most of the guests however decided to ignore my request and brought gifts anyways.    I didn’t want to cause a scene, but I was pretty offended that so many people ignored my request.  I was so torn when my son wanted to open the gifts knowing that I’d just be getting rid of them.  I let him do it though and I’m still not sure if that was the right choice. 

After everyone had left I told me son that he could keep any of the gifts, but he would have to give up something in his room for it.  He did end up giving up some of his things to make room for some gifts (even one of the gifts I had bought for him so thanks for that family and friends) and I bagged them up and on Monday took them to Salvation Army. 

I was frustrated and made a status about it on Facebook about the extra work of having to go down there and it got some negative attention from people who brought gifts to the party.  I don’t really know what I could have done differently, I was clear that people should not bring gifts, but they did anyways.   A lot of the comments feel like backseat parenting.

He gets paid a small salary for this job, but its overall less than $5000 for the season. 

This year my family has to celebrate our Thanksgiving early since I have to leave town for work. The only day that worked for everyone was a Friday, and he happened to have a game scheduled for that day. I asked him if he would be willing to ask the head coach if he could miss a game so that he could attend our family Thanksgiving. He flat out refused to even ask, saying that it's a paid position so he has to take his job very seriously. 

I go to all his games to watch, and am acquaintances with the head coach (met him like 5 times). So, after the last game we were all chatting and I casually brought up that I was traveling over the holidays and that we would be celebrating early on a Friday. I mentioned how bummed I was that my BF wouldnt be able to attend because they had a game. The head coach was super understanding and immediately offered to let him skip the game to attend. 

On the ride home I got a serious ass chewing about how embarrassed he was and how ""unprofessional"" it was for me to be asking his ""boss"" for days off for him. He also said what I did makes him look bad and undedicated to the team, and that it could be detrimental to his future coaching career.

I admit we are to blame for this. Our eldest wasn’t at all addicted to the screen and didn’t need specific times. It made it harder when we had our daughter and she obviously was. We’ve tried to help her get better at it, but it’s lead to fights. This year she started mirror school and her first report card was less than great. We had been checking her homework but as it turns out, she had been lying to us for awhile about what all of her homework was. 

As a result, we met with her teachers to game plan. She has a planner she must write her homework in and get signed by each teacher, and we check it every day.

She’s not grounded from anything else, she can go out with friends or use the computer to talk to them. It’s just the TV because it obviously kept coming before school. She was upset at first but then agreed.

Fast forward a week. My son (17) got a movie after work and wanted to watch it. My husband and I agreed. My daughter was getting ready to watch it and I reminded her no TV. She left the room upset. Later she told me this new rule often left her feeling left out as we can all watch TV but she can’t. We do watch TV at night, but if she wants to do other stuff we can.

However, after she went away for college, she came back completely different. She’s sarcastic, snarky, and always plays “devil’s advocate” when I’m disciplining her. She’s become extremely different and I don’t even recognize her as my kid. 

The last straw was a few days ago when she came to ask if she could get a tongue piercing. I was completely blown away, as she has a low pain tolerance and didn’t even want the two lobe piercings she has now. I told her no, that she’s too young for something like that. She sort of smirked and said she’d just get it in September (when she turns 18). 

I told her very seriously that if she gets a tongue piercing she’s not welcomed to live in my house anymore. She asked why, and I told her because I didn’t want her to. She said she’ll be 18, so what does it matter? I told her as long as she’s under my roof she’ll abide by my rules about what she can and can’t wear/have/do.

She came to purchase a bottle of hard liquor, and a case of beer. She looked a little frustrated and seemed to be in a rush. Now, I will admit I already expected her to hand me a piece of cardboard with a fake picture on it, but she handed me what looked like a real ID. 

I stared at the ID for a while trying to catch any mistakes because she really looked so young! So at this point she seems a little irritated and she says “yes I know I look young—I just turned 21 this January”. So in my head I’m thinking she’s saying this to play it off because she knows I’m suspicious. I didn’t say anything I just looked at her and swiped the ID on the computer. It went through.

We live in the U.S. and we were both born here but my family is originally from Turkey. I usually go to turkey to visit family every 2 years, and we’ve been together for a while and have a great relationship so I decided to invite her to meet my family in Turkey.

Before we went I told her one rule she would need to follow. The one rule was do not refuse anything if you are offered, such as food and drinks, it is considered extremely disrespectful and rude. She agreed and said she would and that would be no big deal.

When we arrived, my uncle picked us up from the airport and went to his house. When we got settled in he brought out a bottle of moonshine, 3 shit glasses and offered us a shot. We obliged but when she brought it to her face, she didn’t like the smell and didn’t take it. (She drinks alcohol, so it’s nothing new to her for taking shots) Sure the shot was horrible but these people live in poverty and this is gold to them, and she disrespected my family for not taking it. So I pulled her aside to talk to her and was like,” what did I say the only rule was before coming here, I don’t care if it’s gross, you just have to take one” She started crying and calling me an asshole, so now I’m here asking you guys, am I really the asshole?

As a nerd I never get attention from girls so I was stupid and thought I was in love and somehow we were going to be together.  We were lab partners the entire year and I did he lab reports and assignments all for her.  I'm pretty studious so she got A's on her assignments.  On the final she asked if she could sit next to me and make it easy to copy.  I resisted at first but she said she had something special for me after the test and I agreed.

Well she copied and after she said she was just kidding about something special and that her use of me was done.  I emailed the professor about the cheating on the final exam, but not about the labs or anything.  I told him the truth that I let her cheat.  He failed both of us on the exam, which was worth 20 percent of our grade so she got a D in the class instead of a B and I got a C instead of an A.  She sent me a profanity littered text insulting me and saying she needed a C in this class cause it was a core major class and her parents we're going to kill her and that this cheating was going to be on her academic record forever.  I blocked her number and deleted her snap and that was it.

1,"AITA giving away our daughters dog after she broke her promise | Asking on behalf of my wife and I, so should be “are we assholes.”

Our daughter (11) has begged us to get her a dog for years. We’ve put it off as we have three other younger kids and don’t have the energy to care for a dog on top of that. 

She kept begging and begging as kids do and eventually we relented on the condition that she takes care of him. This includes feeding him, walking him, cleaning up after him, etc. We said this in no uncertain terms multiple times and ofcourse she agrees because she wants a dog.

So we got her a border collie puppy. She looks after it for about a month but begins to slack. Whenever we remind her of our agreement she would take care of it for a week and then stop. This goes on for about 6 months before we get sick of it. My wife and I are the ones taking care of him while my daughter just plays with him. We give her one last chance and sure enough she stops after about a week.

So I let her say goodbye to her pup and sent him away to live on a farm (not a euphemism, he’s literally going to become a farm dog on my uncles farm).

All our friends think we went too far. Wife is having doubts as our daughter is very broken up over it.

You know the whole bride and groom statuettes? It's the spitting image of my parents. They passed it onto me for my wedding and while the tradition hasn't been going on long, it's been used for first daughters and that's how we want to memorialize things.

I have two daughters, 27F and 25F. The eldest is getting married to a lovely woman in October and from a very young age, my daughter has known that cake decoration is hers to use for her wedding. The problem is they take issue with it depicting a man and a woman and want to alter it, albeit temporarily, to depict two women. They want to get custom ""doll clothes"" made to dress the man, my father, in a dress and hat.

I decided they would not be able to use the decoration and instead it will go to our younger daughter. I don't care if my eldest used it verbatim but they want to alter it and I feel that defeats the spirit of the item itself and in a way is disrespectful.

People hold their coffees and eat snacks literally always.

Me: “Yes”


Her: “Well you should stop.” 


Me: “Is it bothering you?”


Her: “No, but those are the rules” 


So I turn around and continue. It’s a small bag of pretzels, I try to eat before I lift, and frankly I’m not making a mess, being loud or smelly, and there’s no nuts or something someone would be allergic too. It’s like the ultimate neutral food.

We don’t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they’re fine with what they have. We also don’t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don’t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we’ve just said no. 

Both our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. 

Sometimes I feel I’m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds.

My husband loves motorcycles and while he is an incredible artist building them, he is terrible at riding them. He has had 8 crashes in 4 years. He's kept most of them under the radar but the last two have been serious. He had a massive concussion and had to be med boarded (where the military decides if you are fit to serve) and one day after he was cleared to stay in the service, he crashed into a hotel courtesy van. I think insurance paid out almost 3 million dollars because the van was full and there were injuries. 

He is essentially no longer insurable on the motorcycle, his commander has told him that he is absolutely not allowed to ride motorcycles any more and if he's caught he will be article-15 or even court martialed for disobeying a direct order. My husband wants to keep the bike until he retires but even then, I say enough is enough.

My son already has a mom and doesn’t need another person confusing him by trying to parent him.

I had always told her that she was not allowed to date boys until she was 18. She told me that her mother had told her that it was okay. Her mother and I are separated, so whenever she's at her mother's house, my rules don't apply. I think this is ridiculous because parenting should be equal. I told her that I forbid her from having a boyfriend until she's an adult. I think I'm being perfectly reasonable, but my daughter and my wife think I'm being an asshole.
