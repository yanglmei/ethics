0,"AITA for rejecting my moms dying wish to see me before she passes away? | Here is the background of the situation, me and my mom never had a good relationship to start off. Around the age of 14, my mom and dad had a nasty divorce that ultimately split the family in half. I have 4 sisters, 2 older and 2 younger and I am the only son. My sisters left with my mom and I decided to stay with my dad. 

The reason I decided to stay with my father was because one night he came into my room just crying. Telling me he has no one else left in this world except me. That night I promised to be by his side no matter what and always be there for him. I can see that my mom hated me for choosing to stay with my father. 

Skip a few years later and I’m 17 and living with my father still. Over the years my father slowly started drinking his pain away and it took a toll on him and me. He became an abusive father telling me that I remind him of “Her” which is my mom but I stayed because I loved my dad and I promised to be with him no matter what.

I tried to keep in touch with my sisters however my mom hated that idea. I felt like my mom brainwashed my sisters to hate me for choosing my dad over her but I didn’t care. I tried to talk to my sisters over the phone, drive to their place and hang out with them because they were still my family. Except one day I went over to my moms house to see my sisters and my mom, however she pulled me aside privately telling me its best to stay away from them because I would bring my dads influence and I won’t be a good role model to my younger sisters. She told me that she doesn’t want to see me around ever and to stop hanging around my sisters and that broke my heart. 

A year later I turned 18, and things just got worse, my dad became more angrier with the world and I was scared everyday locking my room, sometimes I’ll just spend nights in my car just to get away because I was afraid of what he becomes when he drinks. One day I just couldn’t take it anymore, I decided to pack my things and just leave because I don’t have a family anymore. I asked one my online video game buddy who lived 4 states away from me, if he would take a stranger into his home. He told me that I am family and he welcomed me into his family. 

The day I decided to leave I told my dad that I’m leaving and I’m never coming back. The look he gave me, I could tell his soul just dropped out of his body. He just looked dead. I packed what little I had and went into my car. Lastly, I went to my moms house and she was there alone and my younger siblings were at school. I told her that I’m leaving and I’m not coming back to this f#cked up family. That day she asked me if I finally got tired of my dads shit and just told me to she doesn’t want to see me either. I just felt disgusted and just depressed. I tried to a be a son to my mother and father, I tried to be a brother but I just couldn’t do it anymore.  That day I left to my friends home driving 21 hours straight, just crying. I arrived at my friends house and a week later I get a call from my uncle that my father committed suicide. I was devastated and blamed myself for his death because I promised to never leave his side.

Years later I’m 23, it’s been 5 years and not once I received a call from my mom or my sisters about my whereabouts or how I’m doing.  They didn’t bother come looking for me, nothing. Except one day my younger sister found me on social media and texted me through Facebook. She told me mom had developed pancreatic cancer and doesn’t have much time left. I kept in contact with my younger sister because I still gave a damn about my family deep inside me. I would text her about how everyone is doing, especially how was mom doing. We exchange numbers and we would call each other here and there. 

One day I get a call from my younger sister and it happens to be my own mother. She tells me that she isn’t doing so good, she doesn’t know how much time she has left and apologizes for being a bad mother towards me. She told me she wishes she could see me one last time before she passes away and in that moment, what she said just destroyed me. I responded by telling her No, I won’t come see you and that this is what she wanted and I just hung up the phone.  Days later i get a call from my younger sister telling me that mom passed away and was crying a lot and I’m an asshole for not being there for my own mom, I told her that she doesn’t understand what I’ve been put through and I haven’t talked to my younger sister ever since then. 

TL: DR: My mom’s dying wish was for me to come see her before she passes away, I told her no because of our past differences and my younger sisters tells me I’m an asshole and haven’t spoke to me since.

0,"AITA for not wanting to live with my cousin after my mother passed away? | First of all sorry for the broken english, is not my first language (F, 21).


On september of 2018 my mom was diagnosed with stomachal cancer at stage four. The two of us lived in the capital of my country, I’m her only daughter and my father passed away 19 years ago, since then my mom was single and my closer family, my aunt and my grandma, live four hours south of us. In the beginning they traveled once a month to see my mom, they even spent christmas and new years with us that year, and it was great to feel the support of my family at that time. 


Sadly my mom didn’t take her diagnosis really well and i had to start making decisions for the economic well being of the two of us, because cancer is a fucking expensive disease, such as having to move from a big and well located apartment to a smaller one in a modest part of the city that was just big enough to fit my mom, me and a spare bed cause i thought they would come to visit, but in 2019 through all the period of time that i would go with my mom to chemos, hospitalized and everything I was alone with her.


They basically disappeared, my grandma came to visit every 2 months but my aunt literally disappeared, of course she would call me and tell me to go visit her but i was a nineteen year old woman taking care of her sick mother, the economy of the house and going to med school, so i didn’t have any time of energy to travel to visit her. 
Through all this process i talked to them several times saying that i couldn’t do it alone but my aunt told me that it was really difficult for her travel to see me. Even though they travelled to shop several times in the capital, coming for the day and didn’t even talking to me. I just got to know they were here because of social media.
By the end of the year i was exhausted, and was struggling so hard with my mental and physical health.


On december of 2019 my mom passed away, and i started to take decisions such as with who i was going to live based on economic and personal things, and i decided to live with my boyfriend with whom i’ve been with for more than 3 years cause i don’t want to live alone. I’m independent in terms of money since i got an insurance paid and i can sustain myself until i graduate med school

But in January of this year, one month after my mother passed away, my aunt called me and asked me if my cousin (M, 18) could live with me cause he is starting  college in my city, and i said no cause i don’t want to be in charge of someone after the year i’ve been gone through, after feeling so alone and overwhelmed with everything.
After that answer she told me that it wasn’t going to be like that, that she didn’t want him to be alone, that i could teach him how to move around the city, and that sounded to me to taking care of someone and i stood with my decision of saying no.
I have seen her a couple of times after that talk and recently she told me that she was really hurt by the decision i made because family is above my boyfriend and stuff like that.

0,"AITA for not wanting to meet my moms boyfriend who was part of the reason my parents separated? |  So this starts back in 2017 when my parents split (they were never married but had been together for around 25ish years) shortly after my 16th birthday. My parents hadn't had the best relationship for a couple years prior but me being a kid I never really noticed until I look back on it now. My mom tells me that she's moving out and that they're not together anymore. Obviously this messed me up but I think deep down I knew it was coming. Anyways she moves out and I live part time with each of them. It comes to my attention that part of the reason they separated was because my mom was seeing a guy who lived in hawaii (I live on the East Coast US but my parents are both flight attendants) named David (not his actual name) and I was furious with my mom for this and I still don't fully forgive her for it. Couple months pass and during the summer my mom asks me to come to hawaii with her and my grandmother and I didn't really think much of it because we go on vacations every summer since we get free flights since they work for an airline. We have a really good trip until my mom wants me to meet David and his daughters and I lost my shit. I told her flat out that I never wanted to meet him and that she knew that and that I fucking hated this guy for being part of the reason my parents split up. She was very upset by this and my grandmother was too, and my grandmother tells me that the whole trip was just a reason for me to go meet him and I was livid. We've had arguments over it a couple times after this and I basically say I never want to meet him and she wants me to meet him because she is an important person in her life and she thinks I should be involved with that. Not much happens until late fall 2018 where she asks me to go to a wedding with her in California (I dont know the people getting married or anyone else going except my mother) and her boyfriend and his entire family would be there. She asks me for a while and I sort of lied and told her I couldn't go because I had a huge paper due that week that we were doing in school (which isn't untrue) and she was really upset by this. She kept asking me to go and I kept saying no and that I'm not ready for that. My dad found out and he was upset about it and said that she shouldn't be making me go if I didn't want to (My parents dont talk at all anymore). My mom starts crying and saying stuff like she doesn't understand why I don't wanna go and that its important to her and I told her I would meet them eventually (which for the record I really hope I don't have to). After the wedding she kept trying to guilt trip me by bringing me stuff back from California like some staff exclusive apple shirts (Davids brother works for apple) and she said if I would've went I would've been able to tour the apple HQ and got a free apple watch and that kind of stuff.

0,"AITA for not wanting to stay for 6 months with my mother while she is going through divorce? | (First time posting, will edit if there are any issues or if some points not understood)

So here is the basic situation, I (23M) live in a city which is 6 hours away by bus but 1 hour flight away from my home.

This is my last semester, so after one month i finish my university studies. Now in the middle of the semester when I went back home for one week (like a winter break) on the first day a fight broke between my parents (48M) (44F)and apparently my dad had another woman in his life other than my mom (not the first time btw), and on that week all hell broke loose. within 2 weeks my mother wanted to separate quietly but my dad wanted custody and my mom didn't agree, so my mom files a law suit for the divorce and in this whole time my dad is denying all this and saying that my mother is hallucinating (but he doesn't know that my mother has evidence on him and not planning on telling him until the day of the hearing which really makes arguing impossible).

Now i'm living in a lively city, its like the newyork of my country and i love it, i just met a girl im in love with and its been going great, i'm taking latin dance lessons and it really helped me take my mind of all this, my friends are here, the job potential is better here, my workout routine is set here, my network is here, everything that matters to me and that i did through all these 4 years is here in this city, unlike my hometown.

Yesterday i call my mother to check  on her as always, and immediately starts asking when i'm coming back and says that when i do i need to stay by her side to support her and that she needs a man by her side (i saw this coming eventually and whenever the topic started in the past i always implied that i'm not coming back to stay). The period she wants me to stay is 6 months, until the summer or until my 17 year old sister finishes her university exam and gets into university, then we can all move to the city that i studied in. When i told her that that is not possible and i'm not willing to stay for that much all the time, she started arguing how i am selfish, not thinking about her and what shes going through and that i'm her eldest son and she did not raise me to be like that type of person. I don't believe that my mom is going to move to my city without my dad having a word about that for the custody of my little sister, and if she leaves alone, what about my sisters? i don't know what is going on through her head.

I'm willing to go back every 2 weeks back home, and willing to bounce on a plane given the emergency.

I get it my mother is going through a tough time, i need to be by her side, that my father cheated on her and its devastating, i get it that family matters and family must come first, but i don't want to live in all that negativity and stress for that long, i don't need it, i don't want it.

0,"WIBTA If I didn't let my homeless mom live with me? | So I (18F) am also homeless but I am currently living at a shelter, whereas my mom (55F) couch surfs daily. We used to live at the shelter together (we moved in when I was 17 so she was still my guardian) but I turned 18 while here and she got kicked out on multiple occasions for staying out past curfew due to drug use and now she's not allowed back in, at least for a while. This is not the first time I have been homeless under her guardianship.

But I am now an adult, and there is a housing program that I am in for homeless youths that will pay my rent for 8 months or so which will allow me to save up and get a job in that time so I can pay the rent once the allotted time is up. They just need to find a place that meets the program guidelines, and recently my case worker told me she found one that would be perfect and that if I wanted, my mom could stay with me. But I'm not sure I want her to.

First of all, it's an efficiency/studio, so it's one room we'd have to share: and my mother is not an easy person to share a room with. She'd also essentially be living rent free, riding off of my opportunity, while she most likely spends her disability money on drugs. I also don't trust the people she hangs out with; she doubles as a dealer and in the last 3 months I've had people actively seeking me out because she owed them money and even threatening to hurt me (can't put the actual details because this sub doesn't allow talk of that stuff). I've thought about maybe having her give me her money so I could budget it and make sure she doesn't spend it on bad stuff, and also only letting her stay if she was sober, but this is not an easy job, plus she is very manipulative/I'm a pushover. I also don't think I'd have it in me to kick her out if I found out she relapsed either.

That being said, she's my mom and while she hasn't been the best to me, I love her even though I don't like her and I don't think it's fair of me to leave her out on the streets/in the houses of fellow drug users. I feel like no matter where she's living she's going to use anyway, so she might as well be somewhere safe. She hasn't done the greatest job taking care of me, but I can't deny her good moments either. I know that's a mom's job/the bare minimum she was required to do, but still I feel like I owe something. I also must admit that I will barely be there because I spend 90% of my time with my boyfriend. I basically live at his house, but not fully because I can't (he lives with his parents and I need my own space to come back to as an introvert), so I would rarely be present to deal with any problems she may cause.

So would I be the asshole, given all this, if I didn't let her live with me? I feel like on one hand I'm looking out for my own safety and well being but on the other, I could be preventing her from being on the streets and it might not even affect me that much, but I don't know.",False,False,4,3,5,2,1,4,Loyalty,602
0,"Aita for not taking my brothers girlfriends daughter on a trip | 
I’m in my 50s and my wife of over 20 years have no children. We do enjoy kids and play the fun aunt and uncle to my brother and sisters kids. my siblings kids are younger. There’s 5 of them total ages ranging from 13-4. I love them like they are my kids and my wife and I spend a lot of time with them. We also are pretty well off financially, so we love taking them to theme parks, downtown (our major city), and our vacation house.

At the end of 2017, my brother started to go through a very rough divorce, cheating involved. The kids have been very depressed and it sucks seeing the two of them carted around between their mom and dad. This year, I got a pretty nice bonus and decided my wife and I are going to take our brothers 2 kids and our sisters 3 kids to Disney World for a week. I’m pretty excited as I am a Disney nerd myself. And the younger kids haven’t gone before so being there with them for their first time is an incredible feeling.

At the end of 2018, my brother has been dating again, and ended up finding someone he feels seriously about. They moved in together this past November. I’ve met her and she’s fine, she seems a little quiet for my brother but he seems happy and over the divorce so It’s all good. She has a 7 year old daughter who moved in with my brother as well. He actually spends more time with the daughter of his girlfriend than his kids, since she spends all week there (dad not really In the picture) and his kids go there on the weekends. She is a sweet girl, but I have only been around her for more than just a hello probably twice. Apparently his oldest (the 13 year old) is annoyed with her, but she gets along really well with his youngest.

I brought up the Disney vacation with my brother and sister and they are ecstatic. I extended the invites to them but neither of them are big on theme park vacations. So my brother asked me if I planned on taking (girlfriends daughter). I said honestly I was not planning on it. I explained that an extra child of that age would be too much for my wife and I to handle. And that his kids are still struggling with the separation, and having the child of their fathers new girlfriend on the trip might not be the best.

He told me that it’s my money and he knows his kids will have fun so I can do what I want. But he thinks that I’m being an asshole. Because “I can afford it” and “we need to get to know her”. I snapped that he’s acting like this is his wife and I know the child. I said this is a woman he has known for a little over a year and a kid that has lived with him for a few months.

We haven’t talked since, my wife is saying that we should just take the daughter to avoid a problem with my brother. I do not want to. I’d like this to be my own nieces and nephews in the wake of this divorce. I’m not unwilling to get to know his girlfriend and kid, as I would like to and she is welcome to my home and all.

0,"AITA if I no longer want to be the maid of honour after getting kicked out of the house? | I've moved from home the other side of the country two years ago. This year, at the end of March, I moved home and had nowhere to stay. My sister and her fiance (let's call them S and F; also not engaged yet) have a spare room and let me stay with them in F's house. I was paying rent to them weekly. While there, I was living my own life - managing my own groceries, laundry, etc. If we decided to eat out, we would take turns paying.


A few days later, SF got engaged. S asked me to be her maid of honour for March 2020 after telling her that I didn't want to be part of another bridal party. I decided to do it for her even though we aren't close but she's family.


I gained my permanent residency around mid-May (a very big deal to me - been working towards this for the past 10 years) and decided to celebrate. I invited SF, my work mates and their respective partners to come for dinner. Everyone came along but SF. S said she didn't want to go because it will be so awkward for SF not knowing anyone.


Two days later, SF have their engagement party. My parents are based overseas and I'm the only immediate family member she has there. F has his parents and three sisters. All of them invite their friends along while I was not able to. I attended for S knowing that I will barely know any of the 100+ people there. Needless to say, I left after starting to feel uncomfortable when the familiar faces I knew retired early for the night. Hours later, I picked SF up from the pub (the afterparty) and dropped F's mates home as well.


Last night, I drove S to pick up F from the pub. F may have been drunk. On the way back, I took a turn too sharply and the rear wheel mounted the corner of a curb briefly. F proceeds to continuously carry on about how I'm a dangerous driver. I pull over and said if I was such a dangerous driver then he can get out of the car. F brings up the fact I'm currently staying at his house and where else would I be if not there. I said I have people who I can stay with which he then proceeds to threaten saying it will be my last night there. He gets out of the car and walks the 500m back. I call out to him to get back in the car but he kept on walking, so I drove off. On his walk back, he texts saying I am to be out of the house next week. This wasn't this first time F has threatened me with this. I was sick of constant insecurity of not having a place to stay and the lack of support from S that I packed a bag and left last night. I get a text from F to come back as I was packing the car to leave, but nothing from S. Made the hour drive at 11pm to a colleagues place to stay until I can find a place of my own. They stayed up waiting for me and was welcomed with a very warm hug.

Some info for context: My (24m) father (55m) and I have had a very rocky relationship for a while. He skipped on court-ordered child support for me and my brothes (22m, 20m) for years and we pretty much had no contact from 2014-2019. In 2018, after we reached a settlement in Court, he started to pay CS again and gave us some land he had to cover the amount he didn't pay in the last four years (the land transfer was my mother's idea)

Last year he reached out to my brothers and I and we started a relationship with him (my mother suggest that we talk to him to try and get him to pay more than what was decided on the settlement), however things went sour betwen him and my brothers (as he paid child support after the deadline and ""fired"" my brother that was - remotely - interning for him because his company wasn't doing well and he couldn't afford the extra costs), however I decided that I had no problem with him and kept the relationship going. Menwhile my relationship with my mother has been going from bad the worst, we fight constantly and she is very abusive towards me.

Well, last week my father told me that he is coming to my city (he lives 1250 miles away and comes for a week every month) invited me to dine alone with him on Tuesday (yesterday) and with my boyfriend (23m) and I today (Wednesday), which I agreed to. I should add that my boyfriend is going a three-week trip on Saturday, so we did plan to see each other on today's dinner and tomorrow, also my boyfriend doesn't want to see my mother for some time due to the way she has been treating me.

Today I received a text from my mother in the family whatsapp group saying that we're all going out to have dinner today to celebrate ""our families achievements"" (due to my brothers recently getting paid internships), I then said that I couldn't today or tomorrow due to previous plans, but that I could every day from Friday and asked if we could reschedule.

She then asked what I was doing and I told her that I'd be staying over at my boyfriends (which is true and I will) and couldn't reschedule because I want to spend time with him before he travels (also true). No one said anything else, but then my brother texted me angry saying that he knows I'm going out with our father and not with my bf because our father invited him (my brother) to come as well. He then told my whole family what I was going to do and they are all furious with me that I am choosing my father over them and saying how I'm ungrateful and that he is an awful person that this X Y and Z to us and how could I and etc. However they just sprung this dinner on me and I don't want to cancel on my dad NAD ESPECIALLY I don't want to miss seeing my bf.

So F1 and me have known each other since middle school. But we really didn't start being friends till the end of high school. After high school we still hung out, and would go to a Resteraunt once a week and wait till her boyfriend got off work at 11pm. Probably would hang out till midnight or later. One day I locked my keys in the car and she and her boyfriend said they had to go and left me in the parking lot alone at midnight while I waited for my mom to bring my spare key.

After that we didn't talk for 2 or 3 years until she reached out asking if I can take her mom to her cancer appt. since she couldn't that day. So I did. We started hanging out again. I would sit with her mom on my days off and take her mom to cancer appts. They were heading to pick up her grandma 10 hours away and asked if I can come to help (Plus give her mom her booster shots since F1 hates needles). Last year her mom died of her cancer and I was with F1 and her mom when she was taken off life support. 

This last year I was with her once or twice a week. Helping her cleaning the house, painting, doing the estate, etc. She always said no one else would come help her, she has no friends around us, etc. 

Well she is getting married. She told me I won't be a bridesmaid because she didn't want me to work, but relax at her wedding (honestly don't care about this. It's her wedding) and she's having people she met at comic cons out of state be her bridesmaids. Her cousin who is on the other side of the country, she hardly sees, is her maid of honor because she's married and knows how weddings go. Then she asked me a few days later if I will hold the marriage certificate and help the venue clean up after the ceremony and before the reception. I agreed.

But now F2 and my mom found out and said I shouldnt. That she should've chosen me to be a braidsmaid if not maid of honor  (again I don't care about this, they do). That being married isn't an excuse to choose someone for being maid of honor and reminded me I've been it twice (To F2 and another friend) and that I did good. Said she is taking advantage of me.

I tell them she has gotten me a lot of stuff from comic cons I can't go to because of work but they said that's her choice (because I don't ask her to and she just gets it and gives me them). 

They said after all I've done for her and how I've supported her I should be a bridesmaid at least. That I should just say work refused to give me the day off.

0,"WIBTA if I didn't give my cousin the money from her graduation gift | I bought my little cousin a very nice and very generous piece of jewelry for her high school graduation a few weeks ago. Our grandmother recently passed away, and had given me, as well as my sisters, the same item (a watch) for our high school graduations. So in my grandma's absence I gave her the watch, a simple and classic style Movado that set me back \~$500USD. It was significantly more than I have ever spent on a gift, but felt that this was an important occasion and this tradition was important in my family. 

&#x200B;

About a week ago I'm checking my online banking, and I notice a chargeback on my card from the store for the full amount of the deposit (I financed the watch and would be making payments). Thinking it was a mistake, I called them and asked to speak to the manager. Wellll..... It turns out my cousin came in the very next day and returned the watch. The manager also added that the greeting card I had given with it was still in the bag and my cousin had left it behind asking if we wanted that back.

&#x200B;

I felt so hurt. I didn't even know what to say. I felt hurt that she couldn't be honest with me about how she felt, I felt hurt she clearly didn't value my generosity, I felt hurt that she returned the item the next day.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday: My aunt calls me up. She explains that my cousin had returned the watch as she felt uncomfortable with how much I had spent on her, and felt that she had no need for such a nice piece on jewelry in college. I said I was hurt but that I understood. My aunt proceeded to say that, however, she has a lot of things she needs like new clothes and dorm stuff and she could really use the money. She proceeds to say that she's talked to my cousin and it would be great if I could just Venmo her all of the money I spent on the watch.

&#x200B;

I was so floored. If I had wanted to give her a cash gift I would have, but the only reason I spent that much money is because my sisters and I have all gotten that same watch from our Grandma and I didn't want her to feel hurt or left out. I thought it would be a nice surprise, but it was a lot for me and I had financed it, and it would be really financially uncomfortable for me to cough up such a large amount of money in one month. I let her know this.

&#x200B;

I told all of that to my Aunt, and she proceeds to call me an Indian Giver and say that's disgusting, that I can't just not give my cousin a gift because she didn't want the watch, that I was ridiculous to give such an expensive piece of jewelry to a teenager, and that I should be proud of her for being responsible enough to want to spend the money on things that are more practical for her in this stage of her life.

0,"AITA for being difficult about a ""mandatory"" Monday meeting? | So just a heads up, I haven't been on this subreddit almost at all, so if this doesn't fit/doesn't belong here please let me know and I'll edit/reupload/delete/whatever.

I work for a small, family-owned business (my family). I've been there for over 7 years now, through ups and downs, from the floor to an office I share with the management types of the business. Things are extremely on the thin side right now, some of which was caused by my brother's management, but that's not part of this story. If we can get through the next little while, few months or so, things should be going extremely well for everyone involved. I'm salaried and have been going in at 7:30-7:45am consistently for the past four or so years, working late if they need me, generally trying to be as supportive as I can, because, family. I'm not saying I'm a model employee, I'm not. I make my fair share of mistakes, I'm not always motivated or disciplined, but the job that I do is one that only I can do, so I tend to be the first one overloaded.

Since Thursday, my in-laws have been staying at my house. I love these people - they're fun to be around, love to spend time together playing cards or cooking, my father-in-law is a whiskey guy and we always try to split a bottle when we get together. They live around 800 miles from my wife and I, so we don't see each other often, but when we do we try to make the most of the time we have, maybe a week at a shot 2-3 times a year. They're even kind enough to let us stay with them in Florida when they go on vacation - certainly people I'd like to keep on my good side.

All of this is leading up to this afternoon - I got a message from one of my coworkers, a guy I genuinely like, informing me we have a meeting at 6:30am Monday morning that, quote, ""Isn't really optional"". Now I'm not sure if this is a midwest thing, or just how I was raised, but we take goodbyes very seriously. It's considered rude to leave without saying goodbye, and even more rude to not be available if your guests are leaving. They're leaving tomorrow morning, right about the time I'd be in the middle of my meeting - something I personally don't find acceptable. The more I think about it, it comes down to the fact I wasn't informed about it until this afternoon - If I would have known about it Thursday or Friday, I could have planned for this and at least made a point of apologizing and trying to figure out how to make it work. I guess to me it feels like they're not respecting me or my family's time, since none of the other three that will be there have significant others or any sort of other demands on their time. I've been digging in my heels and generally raising a stink, because again - I have family and guests to think about. I need more than 18 hours of heads up to change plans. I realize this may seem super petty, but I'm really trying to get these people to understand how much their lack of planning causes issues for me.

0,"AITA for not wanting my fiance to be friends with this girl | So my boyfriend and I just got engaged, we been together over a year, live together, and have a dog together. We are very happy, but we have one issue in our relationship. He has a friend who hes been friends with since high school and shes a she. 

I'm not upset she is a girl. But he was in love with her for years until I came into the pictures, they have never slept together, but have made out on several drunken nights. He says he is not in love with her anymore, and she always turned down his efforts to form a relationship with her in the past. But since we have been together, she has consistently shared things on social media about him. Pictures of them kissing each others cheeks, swimming together, and laying down together. They look really happy in their pics. He never really takes pictures with me, but they have millions. And she always shares them with some love quote, hearts, and recently a post stating that if they were single when they were 30 they would get married. 

In the first few months of our relationship,  she was ok with me in person but in several group chats with her and his friends has said mean stuff about me not belonging there, or just negative in general. He never replied or stood up for me, and when I got upset all his other friends got mad at me. When I asked why he didnt stand up for me he said it was because he didnt want his other friends being mad at him. This girl (who when she isnt around, all his friends and him dont even refer to her as a friend, calling her a ho and saying she is attention seeking) doesnt seem to care we are in a committed relationship. When my bf finally confronted her about stuff, she finally backed off, but I still dont really trust her. 

She invites just him to stuff, and later will say ""your gf can come too!"" if he brings me up. But it feels a bit like now that my fiance isnt trying to get in her pants constantly she missed that attention. So now shes trying to get it back.

Whenever I ask why he is still friends with her when she publicly says stuff about me or when she post stuff about him and he doesnt say anything he always gives different excuses. Making it feel like shes more important to him than our relationship is. 

Whenever she is brought up we fight. He doesnt see my problem with her. He thinks I'm being childish. But I know how she is, because I used to be like her. She is attention seeking and I dont want him alone with her because of what she might do. He even wants her to come to our wedding, which makes me uncomfortable. 

AITA if I'm upset that my boyfriend consistently tries to be friends with a girl who is negative towards me and it starting fights? I gave an ultimatum that it's her or me. Is an ultimatum something I should feel okay about giving him. I just dont know what to do anymore. It feels like he never will really stand up for me, and that she will always be there posting cute stuff about him.",False,False,4,3,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,577
0,"AITA for seeing family my mother has denied me access to? | The title is very oversimplified so let me explain. Hang in there, because it's going to be a long explanation.

Up until my parents got divorced, we had a great relationship with my moms side of the family. They'd come visit at least 4 times a year and we always went to my grandmother's house in Florida over spring break. Seeing them was always my favorite part of the year and there was never any issues with it.

Now, when my parents got divorced my mom decided she didn't want me and my siblings to have any communication with her side if the family. She sent a lot of angry, untrue emails about my dad to her side of the family, but they took my dad's side. My dad thought she was just angry because of that and would let up on it soon enough (she's known to make bad, rash decisions when upset). Keeping that in mind, he allowed her to put it in the divorce contract with the assumption the it would be dropped after a few weeks.

It's been almost 9 years and I miss my family. I haven't seen any of my mother's side, including my grandparents, for almost a decade. But recently, my dad took us on a vacation to Florida. I am almost at the age where the divorce contract will have no legal hold over me, so I went to visit my grandmother (she lived nearby).

I've never been given a straight answer as to why I'm not allowed to see them. My mother told me once that I wasn't allowed to see her sister because she was ""a heroin addict"" (totally not true) and that my grandma ""called me a bitch"" (also not true and definitely not a reason to ex-communicate your family), so I've always been confused and thought that this rule was ridiculous. My mom refuses to tell me the real reason why and I'm beginning to believe she doesn't actually have a substantial one. I've never had a bad experience with anyone from her side, and I feel like that that it's my desicion to make, especially seeing as it's basically to the point where I don't have to follow the contract anyway.

When we got back she asked if I'd seen them and I said yes (I didn't want to lie to her) and she went ballistic. I understand that I went against her wishes, and I get that it wasn't cool, but there was no reasoning behind why I couldn't. As I said before she's always changed the subject in a way that leads me to believe that she doesn't actually have a reason and it's just so she feels like she has power over me. So AITA?

Note: I've brought up changing the agreement on multiple occasions but always get shut down. I'm never given the chance to explain my side. I never fought it too much because it would mean I'd have to fight her in court, which I really don't want to do. She has a knack for cutting off contact with people who she gets angry at, especially if they didn't do anything wrong (ex. my step-siblings that aren't allowed at her house) and going to court would definitely be cause to cut me off.

0,"WIBTA if I cancelled the friendship with my best friend because she is dating my ex. | So, I'll have to be brief here but I'll provide info in the comments if necessary. I am currently rather confused about my own feelings and I would like to have some outside perspective on whether I am TA because of what I am planning to do next.

My best friend, Kay, started dating my ex Liam behind my back. Liam and I dated for about nine months two and a half years ago and it wasn't a good relationship. He did not treat me particularly well and Kay knew about this. As my confidante and best friend, she actually knew how bad I felt in that relationship until I broke it off. I want to make it clear that today my ex is not my problem, but her actions are.

A few months ago, Kay started seeing Liam behind my back. When I realised this was happening started limiting contact with her. She noticed and started contacting a few of my friends to talk about the whole situation and - according to my friends - get validation for what her actions which apparently she even got from one of my girlfriends.  When she finally contacted me I told her that I withdrew from her as a friend because I am hurt about her actions. Now Reddit, I am fully aware that I don't own neither my ex nor will I ever tell Kay who she's got to date, it certainly isn't up to me. But I am hurt over the fact that she started dating him without ever considering how it would make me feel, throwing the last bit of loyalty and integrity towards me out of the window and that's what I told her. She apologised for not being transparent and after this she just started to pretend everything was fine between us. I kept telling her that to me it's not and that I have lost trust in her.

In my opinion she can't simply expect to date him and still maintain a friendship with me, even if that is what she so badly wants. I feel she chose him over me and I have lost my confidante over this. I don't want to stand in her way, I have always wanted nothing but happiness for her. But I definitely don't want to be a part of this. I am almost three months pregnant and I have to put my baby's and my well-being first right now and I feel like I desperately need to get away from the situation because it stresses me out so much. I think the best way to do it for me is to cut contact and cancel the friendship so I won't have to think about it ever again. I guess by doing that, I will get a lot of shit from our common social circle which stresses me out even more because of my upcoming wedding.

I don't expect her to stop dating my ex but I feel as she expects me to just pretend the whole situation didn't hurt my feelings and wants to reconcile the friendship. As I said, I am planning to cancel the friendship with her for good because I feel betrayed and all of this stresses me out to no end.

0,"WIBTA for telling a Friend's GF to cancel his suprise party? | So my friend Tom(24m) is a little strange and struggles socially at times but we all love him dearly. The one time he really comes alive is when he hosts his dual Christmas and Birthday Party. He always seems very excited about this party and plans months in advance. Always fun games and trivia and it has become a staple of our friend group's holiday traditions. I think its important to note that this party ALWAYS takes place on his actual birthday and it is always hosted at his house.

This year he sent out an invite as usual and his birthday falls on a Sunday.

Maybe 2-3 days later I get another invitation from Tom's GF, Julie(19f). Its an invite for a surprise party. I think this is a little weird but assume its a small event for close friends out at a bar. 

I check the Facebook invite though and see that she has invited the entire party. I also notice the location is set for Tom's house and the date is a DAY before his actual party.

I'm pretty confused at this point. I'm not really sure what the point is in having a surprise party a day before Tom's event that he looks forward to every year. I'm also worried that this change in plans will stress Tom.

I'm not the only one confused as people on the invite list message me asking for clarity and eventually a group chat gets started with our close friends on how to handle this situation.

We eventually decide its probably best for me to message Julie and try to see if she would be willing make the surprise party a smaller event at a bar so Tom can still have his event as planned.  We write up a very nice message to send that is supportive of her idea while also firm that we think this would step on the toes of tom's party.

No dice, Julie completely ignores our carefully crafted message and tells us that she thinks Saturday would work better and we will do everything Tom had planned for sunday... on saturday. I try to negotiate further but there is little budging.

At this point the groupchat is divided. Some just want as little conflict as possible and are willing to move mountains for Tom to make sure he is still socially comfortable and traditions are maintained. Others are wanting to boycott this party and view it as another power move from Julie which she is somewhat known for.

I see both sides, I know Tom would just want as little conflict as possible but I also know he is someone who struggles to find confidence and this party is always an event where he is truly in control. 

Its also become my job to use the key Tom gave me to let everyone in to his house. I am just feeling way too involved for something that I don't fully support. I can't help but feel I should send Julie one last message with a more blunt tone.

0,"AITA for euthanizing my dog for a possibly curable issue? | On Wednesday morning I put my dog down voluntarily. Just four months ago another family dog had to be put down after struggling for months to try and treat his terminal cancer, which put me and my lower class family out $3,500 ish that we didn’t really have. He was not my personal dog, though we all loved him. After watching his long, overly drawn out struggle I decided and agreed with my family that if either of my two girls got anything terminal and detrimental I would not pursue treatment. Anything minor we would treat it, but anything SERIOUS would be euthanasia. In all reality, I didn’t realize I’d have to make that call so soon.

Roughly two weeks ago, she dropped weight rapidly. A huge amount all the sudden. At first I thought it was because she was extremely old, but then I realized she was moving around less and having some trouble staying balanced. Everyone was a little worried so we decided to gather a few funds and then take her in for a check up.

On Tuesday night everything deteriorated. She suddenly was falling over and, once I actually saw it happen myself, I recognized it as a seizure. She began chugging water but then began to throw it up soon after.

The vet ran tests and it came back that not only had she developed diabetes, but she had gone into serious ketoacidosis. He said that a normal glucose level was 100, hers was 545. He explained that she had probably been diabetic for awhile and we just didn’t notice. The weight loss was her body breaking down fat to produce insulin, and the sudden severe illness was because her body was now attacking her organs for the same purpose.

I can’t even remember how I did the math, but the total just for the initial phase was somewhere in the ballpark of $2,000, then the monitoring would be up to $160, and then the annual cost. When I asked him how long she could have left, he asked me once more how old she was. She was anywhere from 13-17, not exactly sure. When I said that his response was “then she should have been dead five years ago”. There was a chance she could survive, but no promises. 

After about an hour and a half at the vet, I made the final call to euthanize her without trying to stabilize.

I’m struggling here. This is not the first pet I’ve taken to be euthanized, but it’s the first one where I was the sole decision maker. This would also not have been my first choice for pet I had to decide on. Her and my other dog have been a bonded pair for 5+ years now, and my still living girl is struggling. She looks for her and has already started moving around less. She is 13 years old herself with a lot of health issues and I worry this is a death sentence for her too. This dog was also my best friends dog before she died a few years ago. I promised I would take care of her, and I feel like by euthanizing without first trying to fix the issue that I failed that promise.",False,False,4,2,5,1,1,3,Loyalty,556
0,"WIBTA if I confronted my friend about how her ""boss babe"" lifestyle is ruining her friendships? | My friend, let’s call her Trisha, and I have been really close since we were both five years old. We're in our late twenties now. We have gone through many life stages together, and even lived with each other during college. We haven’t always seen eye to eye but generally have a great time and really love each other.

Since graduation, Trisha has traveled all over the world, first supporting herself by teaching English and then eventually starting an online business. I don’t want to give too many details away, but think “boss babe” type business, lots of emojis on social media, etc. It’s not an MLM but her posts have the feel of that. I have had to unfollow her posts because I do find their frequency excessive and their tone grating, but I have tried to be a supportive friend and applaud her on how committed she is and how hard she’s been working.

Trisha has come back to our home country after being abroad for a year, and she has been talking about visiting me soon. I have told her that I am really looking forward to seeing her, but I do need to know well in advance when to expect a houseguest. She has never given me a straight answer regarding when she plans to visit. This is annoying. I have a full-time job and other pursuits and like to plan in advance as much as possible.

I’ve been talking with some friends who live in the city that Trisha is currently in, and they’re all very frustrated with her. The friend who she is currently staying with has expressed anger and frustration that, despite her wishes, her home has appeared in Instagram videos of Trisha’s for her business. Another friend, Sally, is very upset that Trisha has been in town for a week and has not made any mention of it to her.

I feel like if Trisha wants to come visit me for a few days, I am expecting her to step away from her work and focus on catching up. I would be taking time off work and expecting her to do the same. I am also thinking of asking her to get a hotel or an Airbnb when she comes to see me, because I don’t want her filming in my apartment or sprawling out and making it into a home office. The idea of that stresses me out and makes me feel angry, I think because I resent her from being a really unresponsive friend all year (taking days to respond to messages then responding with one word, talking endlessly about “the biz” and how much money she’s making when we finally do get to talking, etc).

Anyway, WIBTA if I confronted her about how I think she is a workaholic and is being a terrible friend, and if I tell her that she needs to either take time away from her work or rent an apartment or hotel she can use as her own personal office space?

0,"AITA for ending my friendship because my best friend was a bridezilla? | So my best friend (22f) was in an on-off relationship for several years. I never really liked her then boyfriend, and never really supported the relationship. The guy can't hold a job, and there were many times that she had to have 2 jobs to pay his portion of the bills. Then they broke up and she chased after some other guy, and when he ghosted her, she was suddenly engaged to first guy and gave 3 months to plan the wedding. I was her MOH, and I live a few states away from her. So I kept my opinion of the wedding to myself. I offered to buy all the wedding favors, decorations, etc and she turned down every offer. 

We got into several arguments because she said I wasn't helping like I should be, but being several states away, there was only so much I could do except for offer to help financially. And it honestly pissed me off that I was doing everything I possibly could and she still wasn't happy. 

Fast forward, I go down for the wedding with my then 11 month old. Keep in mind that I drove 8 hours without my husband, with an 11 month old, for this wedding. I stayed in town for a week so that I could do all the bridesmaids events. I was staying with my parents, who still had to work. She was upset that I was bringing my son to everything, but then was upset if i said i couldn't do something because i had my kid. She genuinely was mad that my family wasn't available to watch him so it really felt like a lose lose for me. 

Bachelorette party rolls around, we were all pretty trashed. She thought I was passed out drunk and started trash talking my husband. That was kinda the final straw for me. I have never trashed her now husband to anyone. He doesn't abuse her, doesn't call her names, so therefor it isn't my place to say what I think. So I was extremely upset. And the whole party her friend was asking me weird questions that you just dont ask in everyday conversation. The questions made it very obvious that she had been talking about me.

I go to the wedding, give my MOH speech, and stayed the entire reception, where my kid wasn't allowed (kid free reception) but she wanted him to be a ring bearer (which is why i brought him out of town with me). That whole trip was hell on me physically and financially. So after all was said and done I decided to just quietly distance myself from her because I was so upset at how I had been treated for those 3 months. 

She sent me a message asking why I've been so quiet and I told her that I thought she treated me really poorly and her saying that it was HER wedding was not an excuse to treat her best friend that way. Basically it blew up, she started trashing me on facebook so now i have her blocked everywhere.

0,"AITA for choosing my S.O. of 10 years over my best friend of 12? | I'm 40, gay. Friend is 53F, single. I'll call her Prue.

I've never had a large circle of friends but I keep many acquaintances. Prue is the opposite. Large group of friends and loves connecting people. We met at work 12 years ago. Hit it off quickly. We shared projects, helping propel our careers.

We've gone through a lot: Divorce, passing of parents and siblings, etc. I lived with her rent-free for 6 months. Early on, she introduced me to her circle of friends. 

About 2 years into our friendship, I met my SO. We were long-distance, so she met him intermittently, but liked him, introducing him to friends. We got along well enough that 5 years later, we travelled abroad together. Looking back, that's when Prue began judging my SO. I thought talking about my relationship would make our friendship stronger. 

Prue had issues with current friends. Drama. But my tolerance for that was low—that's when I noticed she brewed drama herself, saying things like ""..but I introduced them"",""they were my friends first""..

Fast forward to me living with Prue. SO came to visit (staying in the home). Prue comes home and finds he made dinner for her and me. She mistakes this act as exploiting her hospitality. She saw a ""mess in my kitchen"". A fight ensues and that's when I learn Prue has a silent loathing for my SO.

Two notes:

1. S.O. and Prue are in the same field. S.O. is more accomplished. This may play a role.
2. SO became good friends with ""Xiu"" from Prue's circle. Prue has a rocky relationship with her. 

3mos after the dinner debacle, things aired out but I'm still stuck in the middle. Prue invites college friends to dinner. I go to bed early 'cause I'm not a big drinker. SO and the rest stay up. Next day, Prue says SO is conceited, ""he thinks he knows more than I do"". etc. This repeats, now Prue and SO can't be in the same room.

Note S.O. is as confused as me. He's sweet, loud, but not mean. He finds the situation sad, like losing a mentor.

Prue calls a meeting realizing our relationship is dicey. She makes SO cry. I state the absurdity of adults dealing with this. It works for a year.

Prue learns Xiu and SO's friendship has grown. She imagines gossip passing between them. I become acquaintances with Xiu too. During dinner with Prue I say I go to game night with Xiu's partner. Now Prue turns on me.

""Oh so Xiu and you all.. you've been getting together without me?"" 

She has no idea Xiu isn't involved, but I don't correct her.

1mo later, I see Prue at an event. I say ""Hi, how's it goin?"" No response. Not a look. Later, in an email thread started by Prue's friends, she sends S.O. a new message:

""Hi SO! How about you be yourself and fuck everything up like you always do!"" I semi-ghost her.

This house is also my childhood home and my mother  is getting older and needs the money from the house sale and needs someone to look after her. My sister (40F) has been living rent free at my mother's house until I decided to purchase half of it.

The half of the house I've bought is the second story and I am in the process of renovating so that it is a separate living unit from the first floor. It was agreed upon that I now fully own the second floor as I have paid her and am fully paying for the renovations. My sister and my mom said they would move out of their rooms on the second floor. My mom would move downstairs and my sister would temporarily relocate until the renovations are done and then she will move back in to the 1st floor.

I gave notice to my landlord and knew I had to move out on the 25th of March. I told my mom and sister a month in advance about when I would move in. They were okay with that but made no move to get their things out of the second floor. March 25th comes around and I move out of my apartment and move my family's stuff in to the second floor. Lo and behold, my sister's and my mom's things were all still in all the cabinets and wardrobes. My sister had packed up some boxes and left them in her old room for the builders to move down.

0,"AITA for ignoring my mother who married my former classmate? | When I was 12, my father passed away from a decade long on and off battle with brain cancer. I have three younger siblings, 2 sisters and a brother. Life sucked for the next few years after his death but our mother did an amazing job of raising all 4 kids on her own. 

Fast forward to high school, I had found a solid group of friends and we would often party at each other’s houses. It was never anything too hard, maybe a few beers, but never anything much more. My mom has always been super chill, so our get togethers were often held at my place.

Eventually, word got around that we had a spacious backyard and it became the hot spot for high school partying. People beyond my general friend group were showing up to our parties. It was at this point that my mother met ‘Adam’. Adam was always a year ahead of me in high school (he graduated in ‘15, I graduated in ‘16). I had spoken to him before on few occasions but only considered him a mutual acquaintance.

One night, he and my mom got into a deep conversation and they apparently exchanged phone numbers. He moved away after he graduated to attend university, but they continued to secretly text one another. One night, my mother confessed all of this to me and told me that Adam was planning to move back after his freshmen year of college so that he could be closer to her. He would transfer to a closer university and finish his degree there. 

A few months later, I graduated and moved out of state to attend university myself. Adam indeed moved back to be closer to my mother and they announced they were officially dating. I was just ready to get the hell away from home at this point and not have to deal with what I figured was going to be a ‘fuck buddy’ ordeal. 

Angry at my mother, I decided to stop talking to her once I moved away. I would ignore her phone calls and simply respond with a short text to assure her everything was good. Eventually, she stopped calling and the only time we would connect was through the occasional text message.

Two years later, Adam proposed to my mother. I keep in often touch with my younger siblings. They are now 18, 16, & 13 and keep me somewhat updated on their lives and our mothers relationship. They were all very disturbed by the relationship initially, but they’ve all seemed to have been brainwashed to jump on board with it. My sisters claim he’s a good guy who truly loves our mom.

0,"AITA For skipping guy's night because the host's wife was there? |   

So I have a pretty tight group of friends that have all been together r since elementary school. All early 30s now. Lately with people getting married and our careers we haven’t had much time to spend together. So one of my friends suggested a long overdue guy’s night. Just pizza and beers and catching up at a buddy’s place. I said that I would order and pay for the pizza from our usual spot.

So the day of guy’s night, I get a text from the host’s wife (We’ll call her Kim), asking me to pick up some pizza on the other end of the city. At first I was confused and then I found out that she basically just cancelled her plans with her girlfriends to interject herself into our guy’s night. I told her that the place she wants to pick up from is on the other end of the city, plus we already had a place to order from. Kim had wanted to order a bunch of these super expensive, tiny thin-crust hipster pizzas. I tell Kim that we’re a bunch of dudes that just want some regular filling pepperoni pizza to eat while we have a few drinks. The host texts me after to just say, “Yeah, go ahead and just get the regular, its way easier.” So we go ahead and order the regular stuff. While I’m driving to his place, I get a message form Kim that reads something like the following:

“I think you’re being really selfish here. I wanted to share something with you guys that I found amazing and have a new experience with you, but you decided that you just have to make this all about yourself. You know that Host isn’t going to say no to anyone and you’re just being mean to get your way.”

I told Kim , “Just cancel the order, get whatever you want. I’m out” and turned around and drove back home. To clarify, I wasn’t upset about not getting my choice of food, but at the fact that Kim not only invited herself to what she knew was a guy’s night and then started making demands about food for us and telling me to pick up the food that she wants when she was also off of work at this time. Kim is a bit of a spoiled princess that’s used to getting everything she wants.

So I decided not to go, because if she was already getting this upset over something like pizza, then I don’t want to spend one of my nights off around her. None of the guys were upset, they wanted me to come but understood why I bailed. One last thing is we all hang our pretty regularly as a group anyways. So Kim sees us all once every week or so anyways. It's not that the guy's never get to see each-other, but we just haven't had a guy's only night in nearly a year.

So the other day, i receive a text message on WhatsApp from her asking me how I was, etc etc.... I respond to her and tell her that I am currently at work that I won’t be able to text her back. She responds saying it’s fine, that we could talk later. An hour or so later she sends me a text saying that she’s been sick lately and that she doesn’t have the money to buy medicine due to the situation being tough back in Nicaragua, which I understand.

**Relevant background:**

I (28F) and my twin older brothers (33M) grew up poor. My dad worked in a warehouse and my mom worked a part-time job as an orderly at a psych hospital. Really rough, minimum-wage jobs. However my siblings and I never felt poor. Our parents always made sure we had food, a roof over our heads, they got us into good schools and into after-school enrichment programs for free through sheer will power. They networked, begged, volunteered, whatever to give us a good upbringing. And it all worked out great for us: we all got full scholarships to top colleges and did well for ourselves. I am a software engineer, my brothers are a civil engineer and cardiologist respectively. Since we all make good money (150k+), we decided 4 years ago to each put money into an account (1k/month/person) and gift it to our parents next year when they celebrate 35 years of marriage. They can use the money to retire and fulfill their life-long wish to buy an RV and travel the US. We plan to continue contributing to the account for as long as our parents live.

**The AITA situation:**

Last year I got engaged to my boyfriend of 3 years and we are getting married this summer. Recently we decided to merge our finances before our wedding. This makes most sense since i make roughly 5x what my fiance makes. When we were going over my accounts, he saw the 1k recurring charge and I told him that money is going into my parents' account monthly (he knew about this but didn't know how much). He thought i was joking and i was going to stop when we got married, I said no, that money is going to my parents. He totally flipped, he accused me of putting my parents before him and that he could use that money instead to complete his college degree. I told him i was more than happy to use our joint finances for his college degree but we would have to cut back on some things (like getting a new car, nice vacations, etc). This turned into a big fight which ended in him saying that we need to see a therapist to resolve my ""unhealthy"" attachment to my parents. I sad no and he stormed off saying I'm a big AH.

I thought this wouldn't be an issue: my parents did a lot for me and they are getting older so I would like to repay them while I still can. Our friends have split opinions: some think that I am AH for not putting my fiance's needs first and some think I am free to do as I please with some of my hard earned money. So AITA?

We are both in college, although she lives on campus at hers, which is about two hours away. I commute to my school because it’s only fifteen minutes from home. We always _at least_ text each other a “happy birthday” each year. 

This year, I went around the house collecting some baby pictures of her and I (and two of them included our older brother). I then made a collage of them and made a post to her on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday. 


 So this passed Monday, around 11 PM I was just scrolling through my texts to clear up space on my phone and saw she hadn’t texted me in awhile. Then I saw it was the same on Facebook and such. My heart just kind of... broke. I don’t know. I know this all sounds very petty, but it did. So I texted her saying, “So like you never wished me happy birthday... what’s that all about?”

Her response was this: “? I could ask the same of you??”

I’ll show the rest of the conversation, her replies will be marked by the letter “H”. 

Me: “I did. I sent you a whole collage and then sent you a Jake [one of our dogs]pic on messenger. I went around the house for baby pics cuz 20 is the end of teens and all you know?”

H: “I just happen to have randomly woken up rn but I don’t know why you’re up right now and I feel like you just want to start a fight or create a problem so I’m going back to sleep as should you and you have found something to be angry about that you had a week to mention.”

Me: “I’m not angry and I can see why it can be misinterpreted as angry cuz I was just sending multiple texts but the multiple texts was to clarify when I had said happy birthday. And when I asked about why you didn’t say it it’s cuz I just felt weird about it that’s all.”

H: “I don’t necessarily think you’re angry I just think that you have made something an issue just to have an issue because it’s late and the issue doesn’t really exist and you’re just making up a reason to be resentful.”

Me: “It’s just hurtful I guess. It just showed I wasn’t on your mind enough to text a quick “hbd” at the very least is all I’m trying to say.”

Her: “If it is so hurtful I don’t understand why you are mentioning it a week later that seems unfair.”

I have a best friend named Ian. He was my roommate in college (we have graduated by now though), has been there for me through a lot of things, and is just generally a good guy. Since we both graduated college, I don’t get to see him as often anymore. 

He has been dating a girl for about 8 months now, let’s call her Morgan. At first I was really happy for him because they seem so happy on social media and every time I talk to him, he has so many good things to say about her. It was a little annoying that he would bring her up in our conversations so often, but I was genuinely happy for him so I let it go. 

By now, I have met Morgan maybe 4 times. Each time we hang out, I am in pure disbelief that she treats my buddy with such blatant disrespect. She will tell him that his shirt is ugly and he should change, comments on what he orders and says he should watch his weight, curses loudly in public, interrupts him when he is speaking to me, and she is just generally unpleasant. 

I wanted to like her so badly. After every bad experience with her, I told myself that she can’t possibly keep her attitude up, or that mr friend will soon realize that he deserves so much better than her. But they just get more and more serious as time goes on, and the other day he told me he was thinking about proposing when they go on vacation in a couple of months.

I know that it’s not my place, but I couldn’t hold it in any longer, and I finally told him what I thought of Morgan. I told him that she is rude, crass, and that it hurts to see how she treats him. I told him that I wanted him to be happy, but I don’t know if she would make him happy long term. 

I should have seen this coming, but he flipped out at me. He said things to me that I never would have expected from him, and I told him I feel like Morgan’s bad attitude is rubbing off on him. I eventually apologized and he accepted my apology, but things are still strained between us. Not to mention, Morgan has now deleted me as a friend on every social media platform, so he obviously told her what I said, thus ensuring that Morgan and I will never be able to be friends.

I feel really badly about the whole situation, but the way she treated him was borderline verbal abuse, and I couldn’t take it any longer.

(I had PPD and also found out my bf at the time was cheating, she knew this, meanwhile her sister stole her favorite shirt or something).

Last year she decided to plan a surprise birthday party for her boyfriend on MY birthday. His birthday is like 2 weeks BEFORE mine. I sent her a text saying I couldn’t go because it was my birthday and I had plans, she replied with something kind of passive aggressive and I just didn’t reply because I was slightly annoyed but also busy at the time. A week later I texted her about something unrelated and she replied with a long text saying that because I ignored her (again a week), that she doesn’t want to be my friend and that her boyfriends party was planned before my plans so I should have at least made an appearance because she thought we were friends and that’s what friends do and that she didn’t even remember it was my birthday when she planned it on that day so I shouldn’t have left her on read for a whole week over something so silly (according to her).

This is my first time posting I hope it makes sense. 

So me and my husband have been married for a year now. We decided to skip the whole wedding and just elope as my father passed away that year. I don’t have any extended family but he comes from a very big and close knit family. (All of whom live in a different country except his Aunty and uncle) 
I only met them once before we got married and immediately I realised she didn’t want him to get married. 

After we got married he was supposed to move in with me but he kept making excuses that he didn’t just want to leave his auntys house that quickly because it would be rude. I agreed just to make things easy. 
Fast forward a few months he finally moved in. I thought this would be the beginning for us to spend more time together. We picked one day out of the week to be together usually a Wednesday which is his day off. Usually when the day comes his Aunty and uncle call atleast 15 times telling him to come over and every single time he blows off any plans he has with me to go to them. 

I tried to be understanding that they are the only close family he has here but I never get to spend any quality time with him. 
He always makes excuses when he hasn’t seen them for a few days. 

Even when he talks to them on the phone he gives them undivided attention. There has been occasions that she or her husband call him while we are in bed and he’ll get up to talk to them sometimes even leaving the room
but when his talking to me about something important  his always on his phone or watching something and barely listens. This always results in a fight. 


I grew up with family dinners so I tried to keep that tradition so I make sure that we have dinner together every night. His Aunty has since started sending him food in the day so that when he comes home he has food to eat. He stopped eating what I made because she makes him traditional back home meals. 

Our marriage broke down fast he stopped caring for me. When I found out I couldn’t have kids after years of trying he left me crying in bed and was busy dealing with his auntys drama. 

I asked to separate a few weeks ago and he moved out. We have started talking again but he refuses to acknowledge how priorities his aunt over his life with me. 

I have never had any aunts or uncles he keeps telling me it’s normal to be that close to your family. I don’t know if I’m making a big deal about nothing

0,"AITA for denying my best friend a luxury hotel getaway because of my abortion? | My partner and I had an unplanned pregnancy. (Condom broke, we used the morning after pill but I still ended up conceiving)

After consulting with my family, doctors and my partner, we decided for an abortion. Due to a recent health condition of mine that put me at risk, this was a choice made in regards to my physical and mental health. Neither of us were ready for a baby regardless, so this was the right decision for the both of us. 

Fortunately, despite this being the toughest decision of my entire life, my family, partner and close friends were very supportive. 

Seeing as I was only 8 weeks pregnant, we opted for the medical route (abortion pills). After taking the second pill, you get sent home and have the induced miscarriage there. To make this painful experience as comfortable as possible, my partner offered to book a beautiful hotel room near the clinic. (My home was over an hour away)

I was touched by his thoughtfulness and told my best friend, who hates my partner, by the way.  She wanted to join me in the hotel instead of him, to ‘support’ me. 

She went on to say that my partner should pay for a full spa treatment for the both of us. This comment caught me off-guard. 

I wasn’t going to the hotel for a fun, fancy weekend, but to be close to the clinic and have a comfortable and clean environment. Aside from that, my partner intended to be there for me and I *wanted* him there. 

This made her upset. She said that I chose him over her, was dismissing her needs for relaxation (she was stressed from work) and was being selfish and narcissistic. I should always chose my best friend over any man, she added. [Side Note: She was supportive 60% of the time, which I’m thankful for. But she also made remarks that it wasn’t that big of a deal, my fear was unjustified and only in my head, it wouldn’t hurt anyways, etc.]

It escalated a little, but ultimately the abortion took place and I went there with my partner, not her. No spa treatments, by the way, just the most painful experience of my life.

Afterwards, she kept bringing up that she should have been there instead of my partner.

I've always had a good relationship with my parents, and when I told them my gf was pregnant with my daughter 2 years ago, they were overjoyed. When my daughter was born, my dad looked at her like I've never seen him look at anyone. He was completely besotted.

Cut to three months later and my mum is diagnosed with cancer. It's a big thing, but we stay strong and we work through it.

A month after this, my mum finds out that my dad has been cheating on her. She came home one day and he was sat on the sofa covered in love bites. He wanted to be caught clearly, easier than having the hard conversation. Not only that, but he started cheating on her a week after she was diagnosed with cancer. He was actively looking - we found his online dating profile listing him as 'single', created a week after the diagnosis. He has decided to do this when my mum needed him the most, and then spent all of his time with this new woman, refusing to take my mum for her chemo or help around the house. He used the house like a hotel, stopping for food and sleep before he went back out with her.

Once he'd been caught he announced that this woman was the love of his life, and that he was excited to start his new life with his new family (she has two daughters). My sister was understandably angry as he's never really shown her much affection.

Since then he's become this horrible person, telling people that my mum was 'overexaggerating' the cancer for attention, and more. We also found out that he'd been using prostitutes for a number of years, and that he'd been fired from several jobs for stealing when he told us he'd moved jobs of his own volition.

Yesterday I decided to clear out the apartment my SO I have together, he had loads of junk in one of the cupboards,empty boxes and things he doesn't use anymore. However when I was clearing I went through every box to make sure there were no wires or warranty stuff still in the boxes and if it looked important I asked if he wanted to bin or keep. There were a few things he wanted to keep and without question they went back into the closet. 

However about an hour into it (when I was nearly done) my SO started to help and lifted the only thing of mine in the cupboard. A set of outdoor lights my mom had bought for me in the summer, he asked me 3 times if I wanted to keep them so I said on the final time, ""my mom bought them for me"" so he would understand to just drop it and keep them. But no. He decided to call them ""ugly"" and ""disgusting"" and that we should just throw them out. I silently started crying and went into the bathroom to gather myself.

I came out again and he was in the process of putting them in the bin and I said no I want to keep them because they mean something to me, and that my ill mom had thought of me and bought them.  

He proceeded to tell me they were ""disgusting "" again and said they were cheap and just be thrown out. I got annoyed at this point because he kept going on about the lights, I told him that when I asked him if he wanted to keep XYZ  I didn't question it. 

So this ended up in a big argument that he doesn't seem to think was his fault. I only got angry after I told him my mom got them for me and he kept insisting they should be thrown out.

It was the only thing in the closet that I wanted to keep :( he kept loads of things and I only wanted to keep one thing. I know it's stupid but I cherish the thought of my mom picking up the lights and being excited to give them to me.

We would consult each other on everything, often times about more serious and intimate aspects of our lives. About a year ago  Anthony suddenly stopped responding to messages and started avoided us. Our group is very candid with each other so after a couple months of this strange change in behavior, us reaching out, asking if he was alright, we were frank and said it felt like he was making himself pretty distant. He appreciated our feedback and told us he'd make more of an effort to participate, and at least respond to us to let us know what's up and if he's okay.

It was such a big life change, I felt that myself and others were a little cheated because we put so much trust into our friendship and it was clear he didn't feel the same way. 

He continued not really being involved. A couple of our friends who live out of town stopped putting in effort cause Anthony never did, then it's just me and my friend Eric left. The group will occasionally chat about big life events or updates, but it is slowing down. I guess it's just the way life goes.

I haven't heard from Anthony at all in a few months and he messaged me out of the blue saying he is planning on getting engaged so he is wanting a discounted photography rate for the proposal.

&#x200B;

I have this friend (Let's call him Jake) from college, we've been friends going on 10 years at this point. Jake's getting married in September to a lovely girl named Jenny. They already live together (they recently bought a house together) and have been dating for 3 1/2 years. 

&#x200B;

Jenny has been very up-front with Jake about what she expects from him, from day one. She wants to start a family, eventually stop working to be a  stay-at-home mom, ect. She also expects him to be more mature than he has been, ie, no all-nighters drinking, no playing video games til 4 am, things that we did during college we shouldn't be doing anymore. She's also said, many times, she explicitly is not okay with him going to strip clubs. Her exact words on the subject were, ""If he went along for someone else's bachelor party, and didn't get any dances or anything, I *GUESS* I could be okay with it. But the second he's getting lap dances, I'm done.""

&#x200B;

Jake's bachelor party is coming up the first weekend in August. He's already expressed his explicit desire that, regardless of what we do during the day, every night he wants to get hammered, do drugs (marijuana at the least, but he's experimented with other substances before when drunk) and go to strip clubs. He already has one picked out that ""caters"" to bachelor parties. We will be in a different city than the one we all live in. 

&#x200B;

Now, WIBTA if I bailed on being a part of all of this? I'm one of his oldest friends, and I even offered to help plan the damn thing, but based on his desires to over-indulge and deliberately do things his future wife isn't okay with, I really don't want to even be there. I've 'grown up' a lot over the last year, and I've even realized that he's used me being a single bachelor as an excuse for doing things that upset his fiance, such as staying out drinking. He also talked me into going to strip clubs with him before I knew she wasn't okay with that happening. I realize that, if one of his oldest friends bails on his bachelor party, it'll raise questions, and possibly make his fiance suspicious, which honestly, I would probably be okay with.

My fiance on the other hand has a very large family whom she is close with and we both see often. I have run into some problems where my mother feels I have to do certain things in order for her to be happy.

For background I chose my close friends daughters as my flower girls, they were very excited. They maintain a close relationship with me even when my work schedule intervenes, and I am very close with his daughters.
My mother on hearing this insisted I invite my cousins daughters to be flower girls as well, telling me it would hurt my cousins and her daughters feelings, as well as deeply upset my mother. My mother spent days crying and insisting I don't care about my family at all. Sadly I see my cousin and her daughters only a couple of times a year despite an effort to keep in touch. I have little relations with my cousins or her daughters at best. My mother insisted and ultimately I Felt guilty and gave in and asked them. They showed little excitement about the prospect of being my flower girls and are unsure if they want to do it.

Fast foward and now my mother is insisting that I invite my great Aunt, with whom I have 0 relations and have only seen a few times in my life. The same guilt trip is being pushed on me, how it will upset my mother and grandmother and once again she claims it shows I ""Don't care about my family."" Furthermore my Great Aunt has difficulty walking at her age and would require me to invite my 2nd cousin who unfortunately is very trashy and I do not want attending. This 2nd cousin has also never been a part of my family life and I have met only a couple of times. My mother has told me she's so upset that I should just remove all her friends because I ""Don't care about her anyway""

The reason they broke up was because she just randomly told him one night that she wants to breakup, and they weren't fighting, and she never voiced that she was having any issues with the relationship (they had been dating for 4 years at this point). I then learnt afterwards that the reason she broke up with him was because she started fooling around with a guy she worked with. Immediately after she broke up with him she spent the night at this guy's house all week (I used to live with my cousin and her mother), brought him over to the house when she thought I wasn't home. She tried to keep this all a secret from me, and I immediately distanced myself from my cousin and stopped really hanging out, and even talking to her.

Since then I moved in with my best friend and we're renting a place. The other day my cousin was texting my best friend (her ex) saying she wants to talk. My best friend said that he really doesn't want to see her at all. She then showed up uninvited to ""visit my cousin"". My best friend answered the door and it was very uncomfortable for him.

Last year we had a rough patch, and decided to get a divorce. During the divorce process I found out I was pregnant. (Was on birth control, and was told by doctors I was infertile because of medical reasons). After the pregnancy we decided to stay together and work on our relationship for the baby. 

Fast forward until now. I am currently 36 weeks pregnant and expecting a little boy. My husband and I have been working on our relationship and it has gotten a lot better. However, there is an issue that always comes up that we cant seem to get past. During our break he decided to start talking to one of his coworkers, everyone at his work knew we split and was accepting of it (even though we weren't legally divorced yet). After we decided to stay together, obviously all ties were cut with this woman. However, none of his coworkers know that he and I are still married or even know that he has a child on the way. This wouldn't bother me but he comes into my work all the time to talk with my boss and coworkers. Everyone knows I am still married and I cant hide my belly obviously. It is complete opposite with him though. I am not allowed to come into his work, he never takes me out when he goes out with his coworkers. When he plays video games with his friends I cant be in the same room because he doesnt want them to here me. If we do go out, I am introduced as his friend. The only actual couple interaction we have had is at his brother's wedding where he introduced me as his wife. 

 I asked him about it and he told me that he hasn't told anyone becuase he doesnt want any backlash coming on to me or him from his ex or any of her friends at work. He says that he has only told the people that matter and no one else needs to know his personal life. However to me, it makes it seem like he is hiding me from his coworkers. It turns into a fight every time I ask him to make it public that we are together or even the fact he has a baby on the way.

0,"AITA for lying to my dying husband & destroying his parents life? | Posting from a throwaway account. 
Me (31 F) & kids (2 F, 4 M) moved with my husband  (31 M) from where we met, married & had our children in California to Texas. We always said we would raise our kids in small town Texas where my husband grew up. It was his dream & I was happy to support him!
When we moved – to a house a few blocks away from his parents – we thought we would be getting some help from his parents with the kids. They babysat the oldest twice in 8 months. They showed very little interest in the kids but had my husband over multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health) & did come over to dinner a few times. He adored his parents & they adored him. Their only child. Their golden boy. 

My husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer that was terminal earlier in the year. He died within 5 weeks of diagnosis. It was tragic & I am still in shock. When he was dying he was in a great deal of pain & on morphine & wasn’t always coherent or thinking straight. However he told me his parents were devastated I would move the kids back to where I grew up in Canada & they wouldn’t be able to watch the kids grow up. Well…that was my exact plan. My parents are the most amazing grandparents & help my sister out a lot (2 days a week of full babysitting!) & would do the same for me. Canada has a great education & healthcare system & my siblings & parents are live near each other so the kids and I would have a support network.

I lied to my husband. I told him I would stay & raise the kids as Texans as we had planned. He was in so much pain & distress & I couldn’t add to it. I chose the easy way out.

2 weeks after the funeral I moved my sweet babies home to Canada. My parents in law are now telling everyone I betrayed a dying man’s last wish. I have told them we will visit every year & they are welcome to visit us in Canada whenever they wish. They don’t care – they said I have broken their family.

Over the summer, I spent a month with my aunts (my dad’s sisters). When my parents died, they wanted to take me in, but I ended up living with my grandparents instead. My aunts still visited me a lot, and I visited them a lot, but this summer was the first time I stayed with them for a month straight. 

I did a lot of stuff while visiting my aunts. One of them gave me a job at her bakery, and I loved helping and earning money. They taught me to drive, which my grandparents said I couldn’t do until I turn 18. I also started dating a guy who will be going to the local high school. I visited the high school and I loved it, it was so much bigger than the tiny school I went to last year near my grandparents, with a lot more class options and AP courses and extracurriculars. I also felt like I got to know my aunts a lot better, and they told me a lot of stories about my dad which I never knew before. 

My aunts always told me that their door is always open for me, and that I’m welcome any time. I told them that I wanted to move in with them, and they were thrilled. Then I told my grandparents and they were not thrilled, they seemed really upset. I didn’t really think about what it would mean for them if I moved out.

0,"AITA for kicking my veteran brother out onto the street? | I will try keep this short, but I have a lot of emotions right now. Would love some opinions. 

My brother (28) just got back from deployment. For several years he has done his best to keep his distance from our family and not talked to any of us. 

Two days ago he turns up on my doorstep with his bags. Our mother passed a few years ago, my father a year before that, and no one heard from him during any of that. 

So he’s on my doorstep being happy and pretending he is just stopping in. Talking as if it hadn’t been nearly a decade. 
Then he tells me the place he was going to stay at fell through and he has no where to go. 

Now.. I live in a two bedroom apartment. With my husband and two 5 year olds. We don’t have enough room for another person - let alone someone I don’t even really know anymore. 

I ask him if he needs money for a cab, or for me to check with some friends of mine to see if they can take on a renter. 
At the mention of him paying rent he loses his shit. He starts raising his voice and tensing his arms. My husband  stood up defensively (understandably in my opinion). At which point my brother started to look like he was about to start a fight. 
My husband used to be a police officer and he warned my brother to calm down or get out. 
After some yelling and some firm intimidation from my husband, my brother left, slamming the door on his way out, yelling about how I’ve never been a good sister. 

So here I am. I feel bad. But I feel stupid for feeling bad. Like. He verbally assaulted my husband and I, in my house, with my kids in the next room, after we offered to help. 
But a part of me is saying... he might have been in combat. He might not be seeing things right. I don’t know what he has gone through in the military in the last 8 or so years. 

TL;DR 
My estranged brother got back from deployment and wanted a place to stay. We haven’t got the space but I offered to help find him somewhere. He got very angry and we kicked him out immediately. Now he likely doesn’t have anywhere to go at all. I feel bad.

During all this I was in and out of relationships, some they met, some they didn’t. But for some reason they really latched on to my most recent ex.

I was also told by my ex during one of our fights that they were talking to him, he was hanging out at their house (he worked close to them), and they were offering him a place to stay when we would fight. To my knowledge, they still communicate with him.

If it matters, my ex and I split because he was a liar (finances and criminal history mostly), played a victim, and used me as a crutch.

Since then I’ve only been to their house for family gatherings where everyone is there. I don’t go to events with just them anymore, and frankly I don’t want to be around them. I realize I don’t “own” my ex and they can have a relationship with him if they want, what I’m most upset about is they chose to believe his side of arguments over mine after knowing him for only 2 years.

Ever since my grandfather passed away, my grandmother has been very reliant on my mum and me (aunt/mum's sister isn't very nice and lives quite a distance away) which makes sense. Due to bereavement, her memory has gotten a bit worse but she's had medical tests and there's nothing permanent. She needs glasses and a hearing aid (but refuses to wear them).

Some weeks later we spoke about her wanting to have children. She then told me that she thought she couldn’t get pregnant. I asked some follow up questions to her concern, had she and her husband tried for long? Had she seen a doctor about it? And so on.
Turns out the answer was none of this, ”it was just a feeling” she said. So I said she couldn’t know before she tried and she got pissed at me. I decided not to bring up the matter again since it was obviously sensitive.
Later that summer I lost my baby late in the pregnancy. Of course my life was a mess and I needed my friend. She never called. I called her crying once and she had nothing to say. Some more weeks went by and I started to feel stronger. She invited me over for coffee.
As we sat by her dinner table she told me she was pregnant and almost half way through the pregnancy. This means she got pregnant right after she told me she thought she couldn’t get pregnant. 
She then starts talking about all the issues she has with work and other stuff during the pregnancy. She showed no respect for my situation at all.
Also, during all the years we’ve known each other I was always there for her. When boyfriends left her. When her mum passed away. My door was always open whenever she called me.
And now she did this to me. It felt as if she wanted to get back at me for becoming pregnant before her. I left her house devestaded and crying.
I did not contact her after that for a while. She then wrote to me and said she missed me. I replied that she had hurt me and that I had needed a break from her. She never replied to this. 
Her baby is due soon. Am I the asshole for not calling her?",False,False,4,3,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,377
0,"AITA My friend asked me to be her bridesman, but I bailed during the bridal shower and bachelorette party because I felt uncomfortable. | So last year, one of my best friends got engaged. We have been close for years as best friends and I was thrilled for her. I did not know her fiance, but she wanted me at her wedding and asked if I would be one of her bridesmaids, or a bridesman if you will. I got a chuckle out of the idea, but I really wanted to be there for her more than anything because friends support friends. I also live in a different city and state, and I wanted to see someone whom I do not see often. So I said yes.

I am the only man in the group and did not know the other women before. I still do not know everyone. But I went to the bridal shower this past weekend, and I felt very uncomfortable. This was my very first one, too, and did not have any idea of what I was getting into. I am shy and don't always take to people immediately, but I thought the people there were not terribly friendly. I also forgot a gift (I am an asshole there no doubt). 

The first game was seeing who had the most unique items in their purse. That was followed by games such as who knew the most about the soon-to-be-bride and guessing if the groom or the bride did ""these things first"". I was the only man there and just felt very out of place. I learned that the bachelorette party was changing, and was going to involve a sleepover. 

I felt so uncomfortable that I faked a sudden family event and left the party as the bridal party was getting ready to party. I didn't want to tell my friend/bride that I was uncomfortable and lied.

1,"AITA for confronting veterans I think are lying about their service or PTSD based on my own experiences? | Okay, so I'm a veteran of 10 years. I was enlisted in the Marine Corps for 4 years and commissioned in the Army for 6. I'm pretty laid back in a lot of things, but I can never ignore when someone tells obvious lies about their military service, and I feel compelled to confront them when they do.

I was not infantry in the Marines, but I served in an infantry unit for nearly 3 years, and I found that to be more in line with what I wanted to do. I got out, got my degree, and commissioned into the Army as an infantry officer, and got out as a Captain, which is when it stops being fun.

In my time, i have seen a best friend bleeding out of his nose and mouth with 2 bullets in his lungs, knowing his kids were about to be orphaned by him and his wife would be a young widow (amazingly he loved, despite dying twice). I've been shot at, and blown up. I've had rockets fired at my base and when we were on patrol. I've known a 19 year old kid with the biggest grin who widowed his wife and orphaned his unborn child. I've known a young man who died after losing his lower half to an IED. I've known a brilliant friend who got taken out by small arms fire. And more than a few others who've gone the same way.

Whenever my wife and I are somewhere, be it a party, a restaurant, a store, wherever, and I hear someone talking about their service, I always listen in for the cliche key phrases. 95% of the time, it's a legitimate veteran, and I leave it be and go back to what I was doing, or we chat briefly about our time. 

Sometimes, however, I hear the phrases all of the liars seem to have learned in the same class. ""Oh, my job? They would tell me what to blow up, so I'd go blow it up."" That's not a job. ""I was a sniper, but I cant talk about it because so much was classified."" Then why'd you bring it up? ""I  hung out with Special Forces so much they wound up taking me on missions."" Bull. Shit. 

Also, when they start talking about their supposed PTSD. Now, I have PTSD. I know plenty of people ACTUALLY suffer from it. But a lot of people lie to create these movie scene quality breakdowns for attention. 

Whenever I'm faced with someone doing this, I start the usual litany of questions to let them talk themselves into a hole. Things like their unit, base, when they deployed, where they went, what their MOS was specifically, things like that. Usually, they start getting more and more vague, or they'll chuck out the ol' standby that most of what they did was classified. At a certain point, I'll just say ""You're a fucking liar and everyone around you knows it now.""

My wife thinks it's me being confrontational, and she doesn't call me an asshole, but she hates it. She thinks that I should just ignore it, and focus on other things. For me, it's because I see someone claiming a false comradeship with a group of men and women that went through things they're only pretending to have gone through, and I hate it. To me, its disgustingly offensive, and I can't help it.

1,"AITA for telling my step aunt that her “parents” are not her real parents? | My mom married my stepdad when I was 5. We would visit his parents every five years or so. My step grandmother had 4 children with her first husband.

When she got remarried, my stepdad and his brother were both in their late teens so they remember this situation very well. Since I wasn’t there, I will tell you the story from their POV.

When my stepdad was about 17, his little sister who was 15 at the time, got pregnant. My stepdad clearly remembers her being pregnant. Very early into the pregnancy, my stepdads sister was “sent away” and about 7 months later, she reappeared and magically my step grandmother had a newborn baby with her new husband. From the moment that happened, obviously everyone knew that my step aunt had had a baby and given it to my step grandparents. But no one ever wanted to rock the boat and confront them. Also, years later my aunt who had the baby wrote a letter to her other brother detailing what had happened and how sad she was about it. So there is no doubt that she gave the baby to my step grandparents.

That child became what I knew to be my step aunt who was only about 7 years older than me. In reality, she was my step cousin. I along with my siblings, cousins, everyone from that side of the family, grew up knowing the truth. Except for her. 

Fast forward to 2008. I moved to NYC. My step aunt happened to also move to NYC a year or so after me. We had never been super close due to the geographic distance between our families but my parents encouraged me to text her and hang out due to being in the same city and also being so close in age. We instantly bonded. We had the same interest, the same sense of humor and rapidly became very good friends. Friends more than family. We hung out with each other weekly for the next 6 years. All along, I knew this deep, dark, horrible secret but I could never bring myself to tell her because I didn’t know what it would do to her.

In 2015, I left NYC and moved to Florida where she had grown up and where my step grandparents resided. We also were not super close but due to my extremely close friendship with my step aunt, they started inviting me over frequently. 

In January of this year, I was talking with my step aunt on the phone. We stayed close even though I had moved away and would text or chat often. I finally decided that I had had enough of the lies and that if no one else in the family was going to tell her what we all knew, that I was going to do it, because she was my friend. My parents and close family from that side all supported what I had done and even spoke to my step aunt to back up what I had told her with more detail. 

My step aunt on the other hand was enraged. She called me a liar and told me that what I did was beyond hurtful. My step grandfather also called me a liar and asked why I wanted to hurt the family so much.

Needless to say, I haven’t heard from my aunt or her parents since this happened. And I keep asking myself if I did the right thing.

1,"AITA for throwing out a box of things that belonged to my boyfriend’s former girlfriend? | My BF [28M] and I [26F] have been dating nearly 2 years. We moved in together last year.

From the ages of 20 to 25, he dated his previous GF. She broke up with him due to work and busy lives. That was her official excuse, but he told me that she was just “really afraid of settling down with me”. From what I gathered, she was his first love.

6 months after they broke up, we started dating. At first I was apprehensive because his ex was this beautiful, gorgeous model. I voiced my insecurities to my BF, but he promised me that he was ready to put her in the past. We even attended her wedding recently. He was emotional and even tearing up, but nearly every guest was.

My BF  has a large walk in closet with his things. When I moved in, he let me use the spare room as a closet because his closet was full. My BF is pretty neat but his closet gets messy fast. Due to work (and the weekly housekeeper being sick) he has no time to clean it, so I decided to clean it myself.

He’s never explicitly told me not to go inside his closet. I’ve been inside a few times, but mostly I have no reason to. Anyways, I got to organizing, and when I opened a drawer, I noticed a shoe box. It was pretty light for shoes so I opened it and found a nearly empty bottle of perfume, an old iPhone 4 with a cracked screen, a single mitten, and a lock of dark wavy hair.

The phone was nearly fully charged and could turn on. There was a passcode and the background image was a picture of a dog, which I recognized to be my BF’s dog that his ex GF gifted him. And the hair was probably hers too. I had never felt more betrayed in my life. I took the phone out, put the box in a bag, and threw it down the trash chute.

When my BF came home, I confronted him by showing him the phone. He looked bewildered and I told him how I found it. I asked him why she still had his ex’s phone. He told me that he had bought her the latest iphone one year for her birthday, so she no longer used the old phone, and he kept it instead. He admitted. to charging it periodically, said he didnt want to “lose any of the old photos of my dog and stuff”. Bullshit, iCloud exists.

Anyways he asked me where the box is. I told him the rest looked like trash so I threw it out. He was livid. He yelled at me and said I had no business throwing out his belongings. I told him, “they’re not yours. They’re your ex-girlfriend’s.”

I told him I deserved an explanation as to why he still kept his ex’s shit. Evidently he keeps going back to the box because the phone is 65% charged and its an old IPHONE. My BF admitted to smelling the perfume “once in a while” because the scent was “comforting and relaxing”. He says he is not reminded of her by it at all, its purely for platonic purposes.

Anyways, I’ve since been sleeping at my sister’s place. AITA for throwing the box out? It was basically trash, and plus he  is probably emotionally cheating on me by hanging on to “memories”.",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,597
1,"AITA for trying to give my dog back to his last owner? | Throwaway because my friends know my main account...

So. I’m 14.  We (me mom and brother) technically are the original owners of our dog.  He was my dads dog, my dad adopted him from the shelter about six years ago as a puppy. My dad tragically died two years ago.  When he died, he had a roommate/close friend who was really really attached to my dog.  She had been living  with my dad for a year up until he died. At the time my mom couldn’t keep my dog at her house because of her landlord, so my dads roommate kept the dog.  After a few months we tried to get him back after our landlord let us to have pets but the roommate REFUSED to give him back and had apparently register the dog in her name and took him to the vet and stuff and said he’s her dog now. We were all very upset because this dog is the last piece of my dad I have left. My mom called the police and told them the roommate technically stole our dog and they threatened to arrest her.  The roommate eventually gave in after fighting us for WEEKS because she decided she didn’t want to take us to court because she felt bad for us (my mom doesn’t have a lot of money and like come on my dad just effing died...) and so she gave us the dog back with all of his paperwork and everything.  But She was NOT kind about it at all.  I felt kind of bad because she was crying the whole time when we went to pick up my dog and she just said to take good care of him and my dog seemed to not want to leave.... But like he’s our dog. She only knew him for a year but he’s known us his whole life. 

It’s been two years now and we’re moving and my mom just told us we can’t keep the dog.  I’m devastated. I found my dads old roommate on Facebook and begged her to take the dog back because no one can take him and I do NOT want to take him to the pound.  She blocked me.  My brother tried to message her too and she blocked him as well.  My aunt said that we are being terrible people and harassing this woman and that we have no idea what her situation is even though we are just trying to do what’s right for our dog. and this person literally almost took us to court for this dog and only gave in because she was trying to be sympathetic, so I don’t understand why she’s being this way now when she obviously cared about him enough to try to sue us for him.  Also, she had the dog registered in her name, so she’s responsible for him anyway. My mom agrees with me and my brother and we are considering calling animal services to see if there’s anyway they can force her to take the dog because we don’t want to just leave him at the pound. My aunt thinks this is a an f-ed up thing to do but I don’t agree.

1,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that my family will always come before her and our future together? | My girlfriend expects me to build a future for us.

A little back story:

She's a student right now and works part time but barely makes enough to pay her rent/school fees.

I'm 24 and work a minimum wage + commission job, I have barely any money saved so she doesn't understand why I spend so much money/time with family 

We've been dating 3 years with no problems except for this, we love each other and live independent lives but she worries that I'm too focused on helping my family and making them happy instead of building a future for us. She's working as much as she can to pay her bills but because shes a student and also doing her required interning she can't work much more. She doesnt ever ask me for money to help her right now because she wants me to save up.

She doesn't have a family like mine so she doesn't understand, my family is close and I really want to take care of them. She says that I'm supposed to be worrying about my own future right now. She says that she doesn't understand because my mom recently received about ~100k for a settlement and bought a house and a new car and I shouldn't be worrying about helping when they seem fine.

She is angry that I dont take my life seriously, I've been trying to get my real estate license for a few months now but cant find the time to study because of how demanding my family is, they get really angry/sad when I'm not around for family events and I understand why, we're a close family. I get where shes coming from but I cant drop my family. I told her all of this and she got angry saying that shes not asking me to abandon my family, she just wants to make sure we have a solid foundation before we worry about helping my family. And I cant build a future if I'm always with them.

She expects me to start saving up money for a downpayment on a house while she finishes and gets her degree and can start helping as well but I keep telling her my family needs me first. 

We had a particularly heated fight, the worst we've ever had last night and she said she feels like I'll never care enough about my future and I'm supposed to be building one for myself and her and she can't be with someone like that. She said if I really feel like helping my family comes before my own future than that is my choice but she's going to have no choice but to worry about herself from now on and plan a future where shes her only priority because I make it sound like I don't want to be part of it. 

Shes stopped mentioning anything about it and is now talking about saving up for a one bedroom apartment and a car for herself (she lives in a basement). She seems so sad but I cant help but feel like shes wrong for even asking me to not help my family. 

I dont know if I'm being an asshole or not for telling her that my family will always come first.

1,"AITA - My daughter is replacing me with her half-sister | I have always had trouble with my eldest daughter, ""Alice"". She was a difficult child, and is now a difficult adult of 22. She has a son of 18 months, Theo, and another baby on the way, she says by the same man. I have my doubts. Alice works in a call centre, and says she's management. I also doubt this. Alice is also living with her half-sister from my late husband's first marriage, and she is pushing me away, allowing her half-sister to replace me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sarah, (half-sister), is much older than Alice. My husband was a bit older than me, and I am only a few years older than Sarah. I won't go into the details of my husband's first marriage, but it was not a happy one, and when he divorced his first wife, Sarah took it very hard, and still bears a grudge against me to this day, despite the fact that my husband's ex wife died many years ago.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Growing up, Alice and Sarah didn't have much contact. Sarah distanced herself from my husband, and refused to be a part of his life. She didn't even meet Alice until she was a teenager. Alice has always fancied herself a martyr, and I have always been her favourite target for this. She makes up elaborate stories about her childhood, designed to make me look like a bad person.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Alice left home at 18. I always offered her a place in the family home, but she always refused, rudely. I recently found out that she is now living with Sarah and Sarah's husband, and is acting like they are her parents! She won't let me see Theo, but she is always rubbing it in my face how well Theo and Sarah get on. She posted a picture to facebook of Sarah and Theo with the caption ""Theo and Yera (rhymes with Sarah)"", which is far too close to a ""granny"" nickname for me. Sarah is NOT Theo's grandmother. I am. It will confuse him, and that's not fair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've tried speaking to Alice about it, but she is unreasonable. She just says that I wasn't much of a mother to her, and that Sarah is more supportive. She also threw it in my face that I don't get to see either of my eldest son's children, either. My son and I get along wonderfully, but the mothers of his children are odd, unpleasant girls, and won't let me have contact with my grandchildren unless I jump through their ridiculous hoops, which I refuse to do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I told Alice that she was being ridiculous, and that she needs to grow up and treat me with respect, and come home immediately. I told Sarah that she was being immature as always, and that her past problems with me don't entitle her to drive a wedge between me and my daughter. Sarah just ignored me, but Alice became even more dramatic, and started putting even more pictures of Theo and Sarah on social media, which hurt me terribly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So I have to ask, am I in the wrong? I am hurting so badly, and Alice doesn't seem to care. She can't seem to see that Sarah doesn't want her to be happy, she just wants me to be unhappy, and she doesn't notice that it's working.",False,False,4,3,5,4,2,3,Loyalty,578
1,"AITA for NOT answering with a definitive ""NO"" when my girlfriend asked me ""Would you ever cheat on me?"" | I (21M) dated my ex (21F) for 3 months. I'll describe the event that was the catalyst to our break up. 

&#x200B;

It was during exam period for university. 3 days before my first exam, we went on a casual date to the local mall. I thought it would be good to meet up and release some of our stress. We had Chinese noodles for lunch. While eating, we got talking. I was telling her about a YouTube video I watched the other day. It was an informative speech made by a psychologist about cheating. The psychologist explained most cheaters don't go out of their way to cheat. And when it happens, most people are surprised they're doing it themselves. It's almost unexpected. She also explained how cheating has existed for a very long time where we probably won't be able to get rid of it as a social condition. I felt I learned a different perspective of cheating and thought to share this to my gf at the time. I didn't notice anything wrong straight away. The meal continued as normal and we talked about different things as well. When we finished the meal, we paid and proceeded to browse the shops. She got progressively worse and when I asked her what was wrong it was like she was having an anxiety attack. She wouldn't talk to me for the remainder of the date and we walked out of the mall back to the car. 

&#x200B;

One the way back and in the car, I occasionally tried to start up a conversation but she felt silent. I was growing more flustered and had no idea what was going on. She began by questioning me and asking me questions about cheating. I answered and was thinking through the topic as well. It's safe to say I have never thought about some of the questions she asked me in a proper and serious manner. Especially considering how flustered I became, the environment where we had this talk wasn't calm in the least. Our discussion kept on going around in a circle and it felt like she wasn't listening to me at all and only feeding into her own fear. She kept on brushing off everything I said and wasn't taking it in at all. 

&#x200B;

She finally asked me ""Would you ever cheat on me?"" Part of me knew obviously to say ""No."" Even if I agreed or disagreed, I understand feelings are still important. The other half wanted to stay true to me and my way of thinking. I was thinking about what the lady said in the video and how things can just happen. I also didn't want to say a promise I couldn't keep. In the end I chose to say something along the lines of not answering with a firm no. Something like ""I cannot promise you that"". She got very sad and upset. That was the last time we ever talked in person. I sent a very long apology text later that night after thinking it through. I knew I had hurt her. However, I wanted to explain my side and how I couldn't betray myself and my way of thinking. Unfortunately she couldn't understand my perspective. She explained how she couldn't forgive me for saying something like that.",False,False,4,3,5,2,2,3,Loyalty,573
1,"AITA for uninviting my girlfriend from a family vacation? | Some background:

My girlfriend and I have been going steady for about 2 years now. In that time, our relationship has become long distance because of my decision to work in a city multiple hours away, requiring half a day of driving to get there. As a result, we see eachother maybe once every two weeks to once a month at most. The nature of my work also means that I rarely get take any vacation time, and sometimes when my girlfriend visits I have to work for some of the time she is there.

Normally, this is no issue; we found a way to make it work. This particular time, some cousins of mine with whom I've been close with are here visiting my homecountry for the second time in their lives (10 years since the last time). 

Main story:

This past weekend, my girlfriend has been with us the whole time and coming out with us, so it was no issue. Now, weeks before they came, I planned to take them around my country to visit other cities multiple hours away. I asked my girlfriend to come along and be with us during these travels, but this morning I was asked by my cousins not to bring my girlfriend along because she ""changes the dynamic of the group."" I strongly disagree with this and want her with us, but it is my cousin's vacation so I asked my girlfriend if she would be ok with not coming. Obviously, she is devastated because we rarely get to see eachother and she was really looking forward to the vacation, but now she has lost the opportunity to come with us. She booked time off work for this, though it can be easily reversed and most of the investment has been emotional. 

I'm torn because I want to have her there and I rarely get to see her as it is, but I feel like I owe it to my cousins who are visiting to give them what they want. I also understand their point of view because when I visit them, they put their social life aside for me, though their relationships aren't long distance like mine. They hold no ill will to my girlfriend, but want us to be alone. Before they told me they want to spend time alone, I promised my girlfriend that everyone would get along, that we would all have a good time together and actively encouraged her to come. 

My girlfriend is hurt and upset at them, and is asking for me to somehow make up for the time lost between us before the end of summer by going on a separate other mini-vacation later on. This is really demanding for me as my girlfriend and I went on a 2 week vacation together earlier this summer and now with my cousins I am taking even more time off. A second vacation is going to be costly both financially and to my work. I am asking her to ""let it go"" this time, and to see the other perspective even if it is unfair to her, but she is incredibly upset about the time lost together because she was looking forward to coming and because now she won't  get to see me for another few weeks.

1,"AITA for not wanting to go to my sons wedding? | Throwaway.

My son has been dating 'Vanessa' for nearly 3 years now, last weekend they annouced they were enagaged. I have never been fond of Vanessa, mainly because she has never gelled with the family due to her general aloof attitude and lack of effort to engage socially. She will often refuse to join in conversations or activities. My son insists it's because shes shy but I think its very clear that she believes herself 'above us'.

I also strongly susspect she is using my son for his money, she has almost no income, she works as a nanny 2 days a week and spends the rest of the time selling hand made crafts on etsy or at markets. My son is in a well paid tech job and I think she is taking adavantage of the fact he's well off. She jumped at the opportunity to move into his nice aparetment very early in their relationship because she had been living in a unplesant house share. There have been other similar instances.

My son was at my house a few days after the annoucment and the conversation turned to the wedding. We were discussing venues and I mentioned our local church, he told me that Vanessa didn't like the idea of having it at church as she wasn't religious, she wanted an outside wedding. I told him that was just impractical, he has several older family members who would not only find the idea of a non religous, outdoor wedding distasteful but would struggle with the limitations that come with it, poor seating, lack of proper toilet facilities, bad weather etc. He said they would figure it out and it was their wedding so it shouldn't matter what the rest of the family thought. This is very unlike my son as I've always taught him to be considerate of others opinions and the value of family. 

At this point I was upset and hurt and told him that I didn't agree with the ideas they had come up with and I didn't want to put any money towards the wedding like this. My son got angry and told me that they didn't need any financial help, they had savings and Vanessa was planning to cut costs by making decorations. I said he was going to end up blowing all HIS savings and there was no way she'd be able to make all the decorsations with all the other things she'll be focusing on during planning so he'll end up paying for those too and they'll start married life with a huge dent in his savings which is just a terrible idea.

He then accused me of never supporting his relationship and told me if I wouldn't support his wedding then I might as well not come. I told him I might take him up on that as I don't support his attitude and maybe his own mother not wanting to come to his wedding will help him realise how ridiclous he's being about it. 

My sons has told the family about it, several people are on my side, my parents and sisters also think he's being impractical and overdramatic, my husband is refusing to get involved at all but my other son and daughter are angry at me and are telling me I'm acting like an asshole.",False,False,3,4,5,4,2,3,Loyalty,569

But that was because it was a split second decision, plus we have a 5 month old that we can't exactly bring with us and she just started a new job, so she can't really just leave for two weeks.


She suggested we wait and go together later on, and just go for a couple days, but we still would have to find something to do with the baby, and she'd have to find time off work, and we'd have to afford a 2nd plane ticket, and I really wanted to stay at least 2 weeks to spend time with family and have time to myself to recover from the plane trip before I meet up with them. Shes now demanding I cancel it until its discussed further, I think that's totally unreasonable considering I already bought it and I don't exactly know how long he's going to live. It might be too late if we wait. AITA?

Wife's side


So, my husband has been talking about visiting his family for the past 6 years. I've always encouraged him to, way before the baby. He always used the fact that he hates planes as an excuse, as well as not being sure how to face his family after going so long without seeing them. He does however facetime them fairly often and seems to do fine with that. His parents also offered to let us ride with them when they visit, which he also turned down.


Now, years later, when we have a baby and I just started working again after a complicated pregnancy and even more complicated emergency c section recovery, he drops on me, hey, I'm leaving the 25th to go see my family for 2 weeks in Maine. I'm sorry but WTF?? Where was the discussion for this huge decision? I have to find last minute childcare (my only close relatives are my elderly grandparents so they can't help), rides to work (legally blind, can't drive even with glasses), and balance work and baby with no support for two weeks. I did freak out when he told me, and told him he needs to cancel the trip right away until we properly discuss it and figure something out, but that something will most definitely not include leaving for two damn weeks, but rather maybe 3 days with us BOTH. Please be honest reddit, AITA for not wanting him to leave last minute for 2 weeks, or is he for planning this with zero discussion?",False,False,4,3,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,565
1,"AITA for choosing to go with my girlfriend of one month as her plus one to a wedding over attending my best friend of 10 years’ birthday dinner? | TLDR: Girlfriend’s friend is getting married next weekend and I agreed to go with her as her plus one. I have to skip my best friend’s 30th birthday dinner for that so now she’s angry at me.

A few months back my best friend asked over group chat if I and our other friends have anything scheduled on the weekend of her birthday because she wants to have a dinner party. Everyone said they’re free so far, but other details were never finalized and she never said anything else about it after that so I didn’t think much of it.

Girlfriend asked me last week if I wanted to go as her plus one to her friend’s wedding and I said yes. The next day my best friend messaged me reminding me of her birthday dinner this weekend. I said I didn’t know she was going through with the dinner and I already said yes to going with girlfriend to her friend’s wedding, so I can’t go to best friend’s dinner. 

Best friend said she never said it was postponed so why did I assume that she wasn’t going through with it. She said it’s hard to coordinate everyone’s schedule and everyone else is free this weekend so she hoped I would go. I said I’m sorry I assumed wrong but again I already said yes to girlfriend.

Best friend said she gets it and to have fun at the wedding. I said thanks and promised to make it up to her and our other friends. But later that night she messaged me and said she’s been thinking about it the whole night and she tried to understand but she can’t get over the fact that I chose a girl I’ve been dating for a month over people I’ve been friends with for years. 

I told her I’m not choosing girlfriend over them, it’s just that girlfriend invited me to a finalized event first. Best friend said the wedding is full of people who don’t know me and won’t care if I’m there or not, while it is her birthday and the dinner is with people who’ve been friends with me for 10 years and will miss something if I’m not there. She said she’s always been there for me and the one time she asks me to be there for her I put a person I barely knew first and she doesn’t know if she can get past that. 

I tried calling and messaging her but she blocked me. We used to talk every day but she hasn’t said a word to me in three days. Our other friends don’t seem to know what’s going on and will go to her dinner as far as I can tell from our group chat. 

She’s my best friend and I don’t want her to be hurt but on the other hand I feel like she's overreacting. She knows my girlfriend is very important to me too, and even though we’ve known each other for just two months, I have very strong feelings for her and can see a future with her.

1,"AITA for refusing to go to my sister's wedding? | Am I (28M) the asshole for not wanting to go to my sister's (24F) wedding and ending a friendship with my best friend (29M)? 

So here's some backstory: Me and my best friend have been friends since middle school. We were like brothers and we used to hang out every day. He's a good guy but I recently found out he has been dating my younger sister behind my back. I didn't know until now. It was only when my sister announced they were going to get married I knew what was going on. Apparently, they have been dating for many years and engaged for 14 months without telling anyone.

Fast forward to today, and my sister announces she's going to get married and the wedding is next week. She invited her whole family to the wedding. I thought maybe she had been secretly dating someone maybe that's why she suddenly is going to get married. And maybe she hid it from me as she knew I would disapprove as I'm overprotective? My sister is the type of girl every guy wants (blonde hair, blue eyes and she's very pretty and has big boobs). A lot of guys hit on her and I'm afraid someone will use her or hurt her so that's why I'm overprotective. But I guess she's going to get married anyway so there's nothing I can do other than to congratulate her. However, the next thing she said shocked me: Her fiance is my best friend. Apparently, they started dating in 2014 and got engaged around Christmas 2018. After hearing this, I felt betrayed and angry. I'm disappointed in both her and my best friend, especially my best friend. No one fucks their best friend's little sister. Nobody does shit like that. To make matters even worse, they hid their relationship from me and my family for 6 years. I'm going to end the friendship with my best friend (a.k.a. future brother-in-law) for being a backstabbing piece of shit. I'm done with him.  

Anyway, I told my sister that I won't go to her wedding or want to have anything to do with her soon-to-be husband and she freaked out. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and give her away (our father died three years ago and I'm her only sibling). But there is no way I'll go to her wedding. I mean my best friend is going to be my brother-in-law? It just feels too weird. So I told her to either walk down the aisle alone or find someone else to do the honor. Well, my sister started crying and begging me to come to her wedding. She says she wants my blessing. But she will never get it because I will never approve of her marriage.

We then talked with our mother and she said I'm being selfish. She also said that I should go to my sister's wedding. But I said it's my choice whether I'm going or not and no one can force me. However, my sister says I'm a horrible brother and that I hurt her feelings. I know it's her special day but I really don't want to see her fiance again.

1,"AITA for telling my sister she can't date my ex-husband? | My twin sister and I (both 24F) have been friends with one of our neighbors (23M) since birth. Growing up, we did everything together. He and my sister had feelings for each other throughout our teenage years, and dated for almost a year when we were 16. After they broke up, we all kept on being best friends. They never had hard feelings about their break-up. However, my sister did admit to me about two years later that she was still in love with him.

For his 21st birthday, the three of us went out to celebrate. About half-way through the night, my sister decided to go home with this random guy, leaving me and him alone. We danced and drank and hung out for a few more hours, and all night there was this weird tension in the air. We ended up spending the night together. It was totally unexpected but amazing. Like, suddenly I saw my friend in a totally new light. 

We felt kinda bad about it since he and my sister used to date, but we figured it had been a while since their break-up so it shouldn't matter. That said, we decided to put off telling her about our new relationship until there was something to tell. We had a lust-crazed, wild month together before deciding we were totally in love. Then, he asked me to marry him. It was impromptu but also felt really right in the moment. We got married three days later, without telling anyone, including my sister. 

We revealed that we'd gotten married a week later, which came as a shock to most people who knew us, since they didn't know we were together. I talked to my sister about it, and she said congrats, though honestly she didn't seem that happy. 

Unfortunately, the marriage didn't last long. The ""crazy in love"" feeling faded quickly, and we were separated within two months. We both realized that we'd made a mistake, and that we weren't right for each other. Ultimately, I consider our brief relationship a funny blip in the story of my life, a moment of ""what was I thinking?"" However, the three of us have all maintained our friendship since then, with our short marriage something of a joke between us. 

Last week, however, my sister called me. She said that she and he had been flirting for a few months now, and that they'd like to give a real relationship another shot. She said that she'd really always been at least a little in love with him, and that she hoped I would give her my blessing to pursue this.

I said no. I think it's entirely inappropriate for her to even ask, honestly. That's my ex-husband! What kind of sister wants to date her sister's ex-husband? 

She said that I was being cruel, and prioritizing a three-month relationship over her feelings (feelings which she claims she's held her whole life, though I think that's BS, or she would have said something when we got married). She says she'd have liked my blessing, but is going to date him with or without my support.

1,"AITA for holding a grudge over being passed over for the bridal party of a longtime friend? | Throwaway account just in case, though god only knows if this situation is common enough for that to matter or not. Buckle up, this is gonna get long.

So, my best friend. Let’s call her Mary. We’ve been friends for over a decade and we get along great. Like any friends, we have disagreements but we can tell each other anything. We’ve always been there for each other through painful breakups, bad grades on tests, big accomplishments, everything.

Mary recently got married and obviously I was thrilled for her. Now since high school at least, we’d always talk about getting married, being in each other’s bridal parties, etc. Obviously this is not a legally binding contract but things like that mean a lot to people, at least they did to me.

So several months before the wedding we’re hanging out and she breaks the news to me that they’ve decided to keep the bridal party family-only. Was I upset? Yeah, obviously, but hey, I can understand keeping things small. Then I find out that this family-only parry includes her fiancé’s brother’s girlfriend. Yeah, girlfriend. Not wife or even fiancée, girlfriend. I was blindsided and hurt, because to me, that’s NOT family. Mary and I might not share blood but in every other way we are sisters. I couldn’t believe she would do this to me. I know that being a bridesmaid might not be a big deal to everyone, but to me this felt like a complete betrayal of our friendship.

I told Mary I needed space and  she said she understood. We didn’t talk for a few months, the longest ever, but eventually I decided I didn’t want to lose our friendship over this. She knows more about me than probably anyone else in the world and I love her. So we made up and I went to the wedding. Honestly it was pretty painful for me to be there because I felt like an outsider rather than a best friend. But I made it through the night without bashing her husband’s brother’s girlfriend’s head in so hey, I’ll call that a win.

All was well, or not. I’ve noticed lately I’ve been rather petty in my stupid revenge. I’ll cancel plans last minute for no real reason, let the phone ring through to voicemail, leave texts on read, etc. We live quite far apart (as in several hours) so this can be a pretty big inconvenience as it’s no day trip. And yeah, like I said, I know this is all totally stupid, totally juvenile revenge. But it turns out I’m still hurt and angry and I don’t know what else to do. I tried talking to her about this before but I’ve always known she was someone who has “misters before sisters” priorities. I suspect it was his choice to do this for the bridal party for reasons I won’t get into, which is why I know if I talk to her about it she’ll just get defensive.

1,"AITA for not ending my friendship with my best friend after he cheated on my sister? | Both my best friend and my sister know about my other account so this is a throwaway.

I'm an 18 year old guy and I have a twin sister. I've been best friends with my best friend (we'll call him G) since kindergarten, so G and my sister have always been pretty close too. They've kind of had a ""thing"" going on our whole lives. For the longest time, they never officially dated for a bunch of different reasons I won't get into, but they were always really close and really into each other.

A little over a year ago, when we were all 17, they finally started dating. Everything went really well for like 13 months, but then long story short, G cheated on my sister and I was the one who figured it out. He swore it wouldn't happen again and begged me not to tell my sister but I told her anyway. I was mad at him and he was mad at me so we didn't talk for a month and a half, which was honestly the weirdest month and a half of my whole life. G's practically like my brother, we've been inseparable since kindergarten, so not having him around was kinda....unbearable honestly lol

After our streak of not talking to each other, G invited me on his family ski trip as a way to make amends (I've been on lots of his family's ski trips through the years). I accepted and ended up forgiving him and letting him back into my life because it was way too weird without him in it. I can tell he's genuinely sorry about what happened. He literally cried cause he felt so bad and I've only seen him cry like once before in my whole life

Anyway, G and my sister broke up as soon as she found out he cheated and they're still not on speaking terms, so my sister obviously isn't happy about the whole situation. She's making me feel like shit for still being friends with G, and she doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it would be for us to lose our 13 year friendship over her. I know G made a huge mistake, I hate him for it and I'll never 100% get over it, but I'm not gonna let it ruin my best and longest friendship. I think about it like this: if your best friend cheated on their SO and then felt like shit, would you end your friendship with them? No. So why is this any different just because his SO happened to be my sister? G and I are going to the same college in the fall (a different college in a different state than the one my sister's going to), so none of this is gonna be something that we even think about when we're living in different places

I was going to the hospital with my grandson for unimportant reasons and decided to have lunch there. This hospital is also where my son's ex-wife works. I decided to invite her to lunch with us. My wife would be upset and also knows my son would be very upset if I did this, so I told her to stay home for other reasons and didn't mention this to my son.

This is my explanation to my son after his negative reaction to todays events:

"" Throwawayson - it is perfectly within your right to withhold your time and Throwawaygrondson from me and unfortunately your Mom who clearly has your back on this issue. That said you’ve said from the get go that you were not going to speak Ill of throwawaygrandson's Mom in front of him. How are you going to explain your punishment of Grandpa to your very smart son. I am truly sorry you feel so strongly on something I did that had no impact on your time with your son. We were going to eat at the hospital cafeteria because I had free food coupons and were there to pick up his things. On a previous visit when the three of us were going to eat at the cafeteria throwawaygrandson had asked Grammie and me if we were inviting his Mom to eat with us. Your Mom said we would not and said something neutral that didn’t bash his Mom. While you have been very clear on your desires in regards to your ex wife I have also been clear I feel it prudent for us to maintain at least a casual relationship with the mother of my grandson. I feel the same with throwaways-other-ex-daughter even though what she did to throwaways-other-son and their family disgusts me as much as what throwaways-ex-daughter did to you and her family. I did not wish her Merry any holiday nor happy birthday nor do we share any chit chat communications. While you and I cannot see this from each other’s perspective we can agree to disagree without exposing  throwawaysgrandson to the depth of the issues between his parents. Regardless of how badly you decide to punish me please do not put any of this on throwawaysgrandson. Today was just a normal fun day with Grandpa that happened to include his Mom. I was the one who text her offering her to join our lunch. I didn’t tell or ask him not to say anything to you of Grammie as that would imply what happened as wrong.

Never outside the country, just to other provinces and occasionally the United States. Well, my wife is pregnant with our first and she's due Feb 6th. Problem is, I'm scheduled for one of my business trips and im due to go to the other side of the country. I've tried everything in my power - i've literally done everything you could think of other than quitting. I've sat down with my people manager over this, we spent many many hours figuring out logistics and potential replacements, only to get overruled by those above me and my boss. I've filed complaints. I've rocked the boat as much as I can but I can't get out of this. And I'm not quitting for a variety of reasons, but chief amongst them is:

1) This is the best and highest-paying job I've ever had and I do not want to give it up.

2) We only just escaped a tough financial situation and while we do have around 4 months of savings built up, I really do not want to risk it. I am currently the only one providing income for our family (wife is on bed-rest due to a difficult pregnancy) and as much as I really want to be there for my lovely wife, I think I have to make this decision for the greater good.

So now that I told her that I really can't get the time off, she's been furious with me.

I asked M out before but she turned me down. I was overweight and had confidence issues then, and that lead to me getting angry at her. We didn’t talk for a time, I missed our friendship and regretted reacting the way I did. C helped me by becoming the bridge between me and M. M and I eventually started talking again. 

Since then I have gone to the gym, lost weight and gained confidence. I also got closer to M, we talk almost every day about almost everything. She gets me special gifts on my birthdays and always encourages me to continue being healthier (I still have a bit to lose to get to my target weight). I wanted to ask her out again, but I was waiting for the right time. I just needed a sign to assure me that she’s ready to be more than friends. 

Since last year I’ve noticed that she and C have been talking a lot. They have inside jokes in our group chat with our other friends, tell each other things that they don’t tell the rest of us, they don’t cancel lunch or dinner plans if I and our other friends can’t make it, they just go by themselves. I figured their newfound closeness is because they bonded over a new game that they both play. M and I still talked every day, and C and I still talked and he never said anything whenever I mentioned wanting to ask M out again. 

So I was shocked and felt very betrayed when C suddenly asked if he could date M. Turns out the week before, they met up for midnight fast food and when he drove her home they looked at each other and ended up kissing. M told him that they shouldn’t have done that but she wasn’t angry, she just said we’re friends, it’s fine, let’s not talk about it again. C has been thinking of her ever since and he thinks he has feelings for her and wants to tell her. I told him that he’s a backstabber and that from now on we are no longer friends. 

I told my friend R what happened and asked how best to let the rest of our friends know. He consoled me but said it was not right to get angry at C because M is not on object that I can ‘reserve’. But that’s not the point. C knew how I felt about M and he still did what he did, behind my back. He broke my trust.

I hadn't seen the world, was working a dead end job, zero life or relationship experience outside of him, just a small town girl who fell into the ""get married young"" life script.

In the time that we were together, I went to college which he paid for with his money from his job (trucking). He spent about $20K on my 3 years of school. I got my associates and passed the NCLEX and started as an RN. With the money from my job, I gave him $30K a few years later that he could use as the down payment for his own commercial truck. I gave him a little bit more than he gave me because I was only working part-time while I was in school and he was paying most of the bills. Other than that, we've kept our finances separate and paid for things 50/50.

Like an absolute freaking idiot and terrible person, I had an affair with a supervisor. It's one of my biggest regrets.

1,"AITA for asking my husbands sister to consider being a surrogate for us? | My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.

Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.

We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.

Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids.

1,"AITA for getting angry at my friend who needs a ""break"" from the friendship? | I (28M) have an old friend (29F) whose friendship has become relatively low maintenance over the years, where at times months pass without us seeing each other. We still have infrequent communications by text/phone call, and whenever we do meet, it’s as though no time has passed – we catch each other up on life, commiserate about shitty things going on, and reminisce about old times (a healthy, functioning adult friendship, in my opinion). 

The past 12 months at work had been intense, I was travelling interstate for weeks and months at a time and was hardly ever in my home city. I saw my friend twice during that period (once for her birthday where I dropped in for dinner and had to leave early to attend another event, and again for my birthday where we had a one-on-one catch up).  I am now back in my home city, and life has returned to its normal pace.

About a month ago (June) I realised my friend hadn’t responded to my calls and text messages for about two months (April/May). It put it down to life being busy, but just to be sure I sent a text message and left a voice message along the lines of: “Not sure if you’re getting my calls/texts, but I haven’t heard from you in a while. I don’t want to seem neurotic, but are we cool?”. 

I expected a tongue in check response, but I was served a proper essay about being an absent friend, being generally selfish, and not making the time, and, because of that, she “needed a break” from me. She cited my leaving early from her last birthday as a major issue. It took the wind out of my sails. This was one of my oldest friends. I tried to call back as soon as I read the message, but the phone rang out. 

I sent back a pretty defensive text message asking her why she left it so long without saying anything, and apologising. It was angry in tone, I guess. I got nothing back. Today, I sent another text message, but this was a lot angrier in tone. I feel like I’m being cut out, and I’m can’t see how I am in the wrong. Am I missing something? 

I reached out to a mutual friend for an objective opinion, and he said I’m the asshole for not respecting that she “needs space”. I think this is a cop-out. We hardly see each other as it is, yet she needs more space. Am I being unreasonable?

It started when we were kids but became nuclear when I tried to wear a thong bathing suit on the beach
 

This is the original from Saturday: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7blaf/aita_for_hosting_a_family_dinner_but_making_a/


So late last night she called. I honestly didn't want to answer but I took what people said to me to heart and figured at some point we need to bury the hatchet and at least she was reaching out. So I answered and I ALMOST fell for it. She started in by saying we were sisters and she'll always love me and we are the two oldest and we need to set an example for all of mother and daddy's grandkids. I told her I agreed. She said she woukd try harder to. I said I was sorry for not understanding the dangers of the peanut allergy.

Then since she is literally the most evil person on the planet, she took my apology and said ""about that, we aren't sure insurance is going to cover the ER visit and I do think you should be responsible."" I told her that she knew what I was making a week in advance. She ignored me and told me ""david and I know you have strayed from the church in recent years which is why I think we have so many problems. We would gladly accept you giving an equal amount to our church and we'll call it even. We want you back with Jesus.""

So she belongs to a Joel Osteen Mega church rip off (if you live anywhere near NW Florida you know exactly who I'm talking about). There is no way in hell Im going to be out of work and pay her BS church a cent. I told her I wasn't going to be shaken down like this. She said it was for the good of the family. I told her she's the one at fault for all of this by treating me like shit for my entire life and I hung up on her. She tried to call me back 10000 times but I didn't answer and I love the thought of her redialing over and over again. The war goes on.",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,4,Loyalty,424
1,"AITA for wanting to let my family know my daughter is getting married and post one or two pictures of the cake I'm baking on social media? | My daughter is getting married to her boyfriend of 2 years at the courthouse next week,  while he's on leave from the army. This is not a shotgun wedding. They do not plan to have kids for the foreseeable future (if ever.)

They intend to have a proper wedding in the future, when finances allow. However, in the meantime, she's forbidden me from mentioning it to anyone in our family or even friends of mine who know her,  but do not know the family.

These are kids who never had an apartment and want us (the parents) to give them what they need to get started. It's a financial imposition to ask us to furnish their house, and I know that both my family and the groom's family would be delighted to help if they could. 

In addition, the groom's family all knows this is going to happen and I feel our family will be terribly hurt if they are shut out completely. We're not inviting people to the courthouse,  obviously,  but they can call and offer their Congratulations anyway. I'm worried that, when they finally do have their wedding,  nobody will want to come because they weren't even given the dignity of a notice. 

Further,  I  make lots of crafts and baked goods. I like to post the projects on social media for critiques and she's forbidden me from posting the wedding cake picture. Her real wedding will have a professional cake,  but I wanted the practice, around just a few of us will be there. Frankly, my enthusiasm for helping her is dwindling and I am contemplating *not* baking the cake, as literally this exposure was all I wanted. 

I'm also thinking of offering her less for setting up house. My original thinking was,  they could save up faster if they don't have to buy furniture and dishes. But she won't let us enlist the help of others. We have to replace what we give her and do without in the meantime, because we don't have money to buy these things right now.  We're willing to do this for their comfort. It sure would be nice to see if anyone else is planning on getting rid of some old furniture or dishes so they can get started.

1,"AITA For telling my fiance that I love my female best friend? | I've been engaged to my fiance for about two months, and before that we dated for six months, so we've been together a total of eight months. Throughout that entire time, she has never been comfortable with my relationship with my female best friend who i have known since high school.

My friend is someone very special, and very close to me. She is smart, caring, beautiful, and an extremely loving and funny person. She honestly does mean the world to me and since freshman year in highschool she has been the one who has been with me through so many events in my life, including my moms passing.

My fiance has been in my life for eight months, and can't understand the bond that I have with my best friend. She has openly told me that it makes her uncomfortable how I spend time with her. I usually try to change the subject but now that we're engaged shes become a lot more hostile to both me and my best friend.

What really pissed me off is that she almost drove my best friend to tears recently over dinner, basically indirectly criticizing her for always hanging around someone elses man instead of finding her own.

I confronted my fiance in private and she just asked me to not invite her to the wedding. I put my foot down and said that I love her, and that the type of relationship i have with her comes once in a lifetime. I may have also crossed the line in the heat of the moment by calling my best friend my soul mate, as i was just trying to articulate how much i love her as it does goes beyond just being a best friend.

My fiance basically breaks down crying, (she does this a lot to get her way) and says that i must hate her. I say I hate the way you're acting. She then asks what my friend has that she doesn't, and I decide not to engage any further.

Later I tell her the truth of the matter is that I love them both, and I just want everyone to get a long. She says im being emotionally abusive for telling her that I love another woman.

1,"AITA for lending my niece my daughter's suit for a job interview? | My daughter Rachel is 25. She works in finance. Given that she's meeting clients all the time she needs to dress to impress. She's heavily into fashion and likes the best stuff. She earns a high salary and chooses to get tailored suits crafted from scratch. They're truly beautiful pieces which give her a very professional and serious look. 

My brother, his wife and their 18 year old daughter Chloe popped in today for lunch. She has a job interview tomorrow for an IT apprenticeship. Apparently she was one of very few who made it to the interview stage, and the company's interviews are notoriously harsh. Unfortunately she doesn't think she has anything she could wear to the interview. She does have some ''formal'' clothing but according to her its more the stuff you wear at a wedding rather than something professional for a job interview. 

In spite of the age difference Rachel and Chloe are quite close in both height and build. Although Rachel's suits are tailored to her, I thought they would still look nice on Chloe. 

I took some stuff out of Rachel's room and suggested Chloe try them on. She ended up really liking one of Rachel's dark suits. She looked amazing in it and I imagine she'll look very professional in the interview room. I let her take the suit and give it back after her interview. 

Rachel was out with her friends today, and when she got home I told her about the day. When I told her Chloe took one of her suits she went mad, saying how dare I touch her things, calling me a ''fucking idiot'' and storming off and slamming the door like a teenager. 

I had a chat with my husband, and with some thought I agree that I should have asked Rachel before I gave Chloe her stuff, but even so I did it to help out a family member which is hardly a bad thing. Rachel's reaction was also extremely over the top. She had a tantrum like a teenager and sulked in her room all day. She's acting like a spoiled brat.

I'm very close to my 3 brother and 2 sisters as well as my mother. My wife said that her family wants to see her and me together for the new years eve but I would prefer to spend it with my own family instead because that's where I feel more comfortable and that's where I can be my self  but when I'm around her fam, I'm basically on my best behaviour. That's why I rarely visit them or even talk to them on the phone. When ever one of her family calls her on her face time, I quickly remove my self and go to another room. Usually my basement/gaming room and she always calls me out saying it's rude to walk out of the room when her family calls her despite that I keep telling her that I'm trying to give her the space she needs just in case she is talking about personal stuff that I don't need to hear but she calls bullshit at that because she says that when I talk to my family on the phone, she always makes the effort to talk to them but I never ask her to do that and my family don't care that much about her.

1,"AITA for wanting to cut off contact with a friend and the widow of a late friend because they're dating now? | Title is horrible but hear me out.

I've been hanging out with this group of friends for about 11 years. Some I met during college and others got into it as the years went by. Last year we lost one of our friends, Michael, because of a cardiac arrest. Michael was married, had been for 4 years and knew his wife for even longer than that. In our same group there is Adam, who was friends with Michael since high school and got into our group at the same time Michael did. 

Now the issue that is the reason behind this post is that Adam has told us a couple days ago that he's dating Michael's widow. We were all surprised by this because we never saw it coming. After Michael died we all did our best to provide comfort and support for her, Adam included, but as far as we knew and as far as he told us at the time they were just hanging out/having talks when she needed. Now we get to find out they have been getting to know each other better for at least 6 months. When Michael has been dead for 1 year and 4 months. 

This has split the group in three. The ones that believe that they should be allowed to do whatever they want and don't see a problem with it. Then the ones that believe he's taking advantage of Michael's widow. And the ones that think they're both wrong and also don't want to be around Adam and her anymore.

I'm with the last group. Yes, everyone deals with grief in different ways but this doesn't sit right with me and I also think it's just a tasteless thing to do. Me and others have said that we would not keep hanging out with Adam and also we would not keep in touch with Michael's widow. If they were free to do whatever they wanted they also should deal with the consequences of this. So, are we being assholes in this? ",False,False,4,3,5,2,4,3,Loyalty,363
1,"AITA for hosting a family dinner but making a Thai peanut dish specifically so my sister and her kids couldn't attend (too spicy and allergic to peanuts)? | Hello again AITA, you guys have previously weighed in on the long running battle between me and my sister so I figured I'd turn to you again to see if I really messed up. I'm always on my family's bad side so I appreciated the neutral input last time.

Somehow it's become a tradition in my family that one family member host a Friday night dinner once a month. Last night was my night. My oldest sister and I have not been speaking since our vacation (click on user name to see why if you're curious) and I was able to avoid her at the January and February dinner at other's houses. I really, really didn't want her in my apartment. So I decided since she hates spicy food and her kids are allegedly allergic to peanuts, I could side step the  issue and make this Thai peanut noodle dish that I love. I announced it well in advance in the group email what I was planning. 

Well since my sister is much more diabolical than I give her credit for, she had her husband drive the 2 hours to my place, feign that she didn't know I was making something that allowed her to say ""you know my family can't eat! Isn't the point of a family dinner so all the family can enjoy!"" While clutching her pearls (literally). Then my niece claimed she could feel the ""peanut residue in the air"" and it was affecting her ability to breathe. So my sister dramatically took her to the emergency room where all turned out to be fine.

But again, I lost. My sister played me like a fiddle and the entire family took her side. Dinner was ruined and I'm the bad guy. Again. I honestly just tried to side step the issue of having her around but making somthing she and her kids couldn't eat--and announcing it well in advance.

1,"AITA for declining to be a bridesmaid for one girl in my group of friends? | I (29F) have been part of a friend group of five girls for the past 11 years. We met through a student organization we were all involved with our freshman year of college and have been very close ever since. Let's call the other girls Ariel, Brianna, Carmen and Dana. 

I was the first to get married five years ago and I made all four of the girls my bridesmaids. Ariel, Brianna and Carmen all got married within the past two years and I was a bridesmaid in all three of their weddings. I was also a bridesmaid for my sister and two cousins around this time period, and between all of the dresses, hotel costs, flights, bachelorette parties, bridal showers and gifts, it ended up becoming a massive financial strain that ultimately cost me thousands and thousands of dollars, not to mention tons of vacation days. After Carmen's wedding, I decided I was done being a bridesmaid, it was just too much.

Dana didn't have a lot of luck with relationships and was single for pretty much the entire time we were friends, but she finally announced she and her boyfriend are engaged. We were all thrilled for her, of course, and she asked all of us to be her bridesmaids. I gently told Dana that my days of being in a wedding party are over, but I would be happy to support her in other ways, such as helping with centerpieces and general wedding planning, and I would be there for sure on the big day. 

Dana blew up at me and said it wasn't fair that I had been a bridesmaid for the other three girls but wouldn't do it for her. She said it had been really hard for her to always be the single friend at all of our weddings and now that it was finally her time to get married I owed it to her to be a bridesmaid.

I get her perspective, I really do, but I really don't think I have any such obligation. AITA?",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,4,Loyalty,359
1,"AITA for disrespecting a student who died supporting a terrorist group? | So this happened when i was in 10. Grade. For the sake of anonymity i will not give the name of the school or any students and teacher names.

So i was raised as a patriotic child since my father was a member of the army and my mother was a teacher. I respect soldiers of my country more than anyone else. And i used to have a lot of fights against other students and teachers for saying pro-terrorist stuff. I live in turkey btw just to clear things up. So around 5 years ago in my class there was a girl in my class that would go to meetings of some terrorist groups because she supported their cause.
Well i would get mad at this but since this did not affect me that much i never cared too much to say anything about it since she never confronted me about my ideals.

Her last words i heard was that she was going to a meeting with her family to support their cause.
Well the next days on the news i sae that there was an attack on the meeting site and that some people had died. Well those days that kind of stuff would happen very often in turkey so it was not surprising that it would have happened in a meeting. 
After the weekend the whole class was aware of that she died and stood silent in a means to grief for her. 
Well i wasn't having none of that and spook out during the lunch break that she was supporting an illegal party that would use every means possible to get what they want. So i told that she knew what was coming her way and that she deserved it since she supported them.

So to say i got a lot of backlash from my comment on her death be it from my classmates or even other teachers

1,"AITA for cutting off contact with my friend when she refused to read my book? | I’ve been spending the last 6 months of my life writing a book. One of my friends “Mary” supported me while I wrote the book. I told her about the book and she  helped me with ideas, complimented the parts I showed her, stuff like that. I really saw her as my rock. 

A few days ago, I sent Mary a document with the whole book. It’s about 250 pages, not particularly long. A week later, I messaged her to ask how she was liking it. She said she finished and loved it. As I was talking to her about it I realized it sounded like she didn’t read anything more than the first 25-50 pages or so. I asked her some questions, her knowledge was incomplete and some things she just got plain wrong. When I asked her if she had even read it, she said no. I asked why she lied, and she said, “It’s not really my thing. I didn’t know how to tell you.” She apologized and said she’d read it. I said, “no need, I know where we stand now” and I blocked her. 

The book feels almost ruined for me now. Every time I look at it, and think about how Mary lied to me about enjoying it. Everything nice she said is cruel in retrospect. One thing I can’t fathom is that she couldn’t even slog her way through the whole thing. She just read a few pages and called it quits. I don’t see that as being a friend. I know it takes time to read a book, but I’m not asking her to read Moby Dick or anything. Friends do that for friends. 

Our mutual friends are telling me that I’m being unreasonable. They say that Mary feels really awful and has read my book and wants to talk to me about it. I don’t want to hear more lies and I think that her actions and lies totally speak for themselves in this case.

My father had health problems for the last few years and he recently succumbed to them.. During this time my brother had gotten married and was on his honeymoon.

I made the choice to be the one to inform my brother of the news. Our mother died years ago, so I am the only one left in our family that's closest to him. I told any other distant family members to refrain from letting him know until I say it's okay.

I decided in all fairness, that he should get to enjoy his honeymoon with his new wife, and I decided not to tell him until he gets back.

We had a few gatherings and then the funeral happened. Some people were wondering why my brother wasn't there and I explained the situation that he is on his honeymoon. A few people thought it was the right thing to let him enjoy it, others thought I should have told my brother, so I guess that is where the divide began.

A few days after the funeral my brother came out and I quickly texted him that our father died. He almost immediately called me up and was freaking out, understandably. I expected he would be surprised, but he sounded flabbergasted as if our father had no health problems prior to his death. I told him that this was going to happen eventually.

He asked when the funeral would be and I explained to him that we already had it and then he started screaming at me on the phone and cursing at me. I hung up on him until he could calm down.

However since then, I have made repeated attempts to call him back but he has refused my calls. I understand he has the right to be mad but he should also understand I did it so he wouldn't be stressing over what would be a happy time in his life.",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,351

My dog Max is very chill. He doesn't like children or other dogs, but tolerates them unless they get in his face. Max had never bit a person before her though. She and my dog have never gotten along for whatever reason. She has taken snapchat videos of him sitting in his crate growling at her, and has taken multiple pictures of the bite marks he has left on her.


We tried many behavioral changes, and some days were better than others. Two weeks ago after an incident we decided to take Max to the vet where he was checked out, given blood work, and ultimately put on a low dosage of Prozac. Things were going very well. For example Thursday my girlfriend stayed home while I was at work and give Max a bath and they had a great time cuddling and watching Netflix. However on Friday I get a call 2 hours into my shift that Max had bit her and was acting very aggressively. My girlfriend called my parents and had them pick him up and keep him.


My parents love Max so I know he's well taken care of and I can visit whenever I want. But Max has been my dog for 9 years. He has been with me through so much, I have a hard time not getting a lump in my throat thinking about him missing me.


I know my girlfriend tried to deal with Max, but he proved to be too difficult for her to manage. That scares me about the future, what other situations are going to be too difficult to manage?

His jokes can be a bit off colour though and sometimes border on insensitive. But he means well, and usually just gets excused because he’s old.

My sister in law is 30, and she married  my older brother last year. She happens to be half black and American
(we are British, it’s a real Meghan Markle situation). 

Yesterday, we had a barbecue for my cousin’s birthday. I was manning the grill with my grandpa. People were lining up and we were putting pieces of meat on their plates. It was my SIL’s turn, and my grandpa said, “You’ll love this fried chicken, we made it just for you,” and gives her a piece. I laugh a bit.

My SIL goes, “that’s very stupid and not funny at all” and rolls her eyes. I said, “It’s a joke, lighten up a bit.” She says, “It’s not funny, it’s offensive.” Then she leaves and my grandpa says something about how he didn’t mean to hurt her feelings.

Later my brother says to me, I shouldn’t have defended grandpa and I shouldn’t have laughed at his joke. I said, she shouldn’t have been rude, and she’s much too sensitive. I reminded him that my grandpa jokes around about my girlfriend too (she’s Russian), and she laughs along. So it’s rather hypocritical of her to laugh at jokes about my GF’s background when she herself can’t take a joke just because it pertains to her. Plus, I said, he’s 97 years old, he’s from a different generation and we just have to cut him some slack.

My brother did not share my sentiments. He is very protective of his wife and already there has been some tension in the family due to it. She is a nice enough person but I do think she acted rather disproportionately.

After a couple of minutes she asked to exchange numbers which I did to keep up the illusion. We said goodbye and later that day she texted me, so I replied saying that I was already with someone and that I was sorry for misleading her.

Lisa has done some pretty questionable shit to my girlfriend. She's a nice person overall but has stuck her nose in some of my girlfriend's relationships too deep and has done some damage. I'll spare the details, but I am fully on my girlfriend's side in this. We can't totally cut her off though since she's the girlfriend of one of the guys.

Now we have no way to get to our convention unless we spend money to rent a car, which is a big unexpected expense. Chris offered to pay half of our rental car fee but as our friend we want him there with us too.

Well when my boyfriend told me what happened I was livid. I asked why he didn't demand his family respect me by treating me like their future daughter in law and not her!!! They have been broker up for almost 2 years. What the fuck?! If she didn't move away I am sure she would be pushed into every fucking family gathering. It is hard enough because I don't fit in that family. But tough luck! Their son chose me.

So whatever where I might be the asshole is when I confronted that girl. I asked her why she was intruding in the family so much and that it seems like she is desperate to get back together with MY boyfriend.
She just blocked me on Instagram and of corse snitched on me and my bf told me to just stop and let it go. His mother and her a friend's and yadeyade yade. Am I really an asshole for wanting some basic respect???????",False,False,2,4,5,3,1,2,Loyalty,301
1,"AITA for not telling my (Possibly Ex) Fiancé about my son? | Throwaway, obvious reasons. 

It’s kind of weird to post this to reddit, but here is my conundrum. 

I am going to get married soonish to a lovely woman, or rather was. I have had lots of issues in life, just about certain lifestyles I’ve had in the past, a real party type kid and in that time I had many relationships and one-night stands.

This was a really long time ago and I’ve changed since then into a more mature man, and have committed myself to this woman I love, but recently, I bumped into an Ex while on a work trip and she had a 10 year old with her, and I was very sure it was mine. My co-worker eventually pieced it together and he knows too. 

My Ex had changed a lot too and became a mature woman herself, so we caught up and she told me that I was the father of her child and I feel like my world has turned upside down. She opted to not tell me, because of the lifestyle I had lived. 

This is big, and I wanted to tell my fiancé but my Ex told me if I wanted to have a relationship with my son, that nobody could know I was the father, I guess out of embarrassment or something, and that included my fiancé. 

I was devasted, but of course I wanted a relationship with him so I decided not to tell my fiancé.

And, well, she found out when she got pretty suspicious of my co-workers behaviour, and found out that I hadn’t planned on telling her despite my Ex’s conditions and now she might leave me. 

So, AITA?",False,False,4,3,5,2,2,3,Loyalty,294
1,"AITA for warning my neighbor about his wife? | I live in a condo. Our building has 12 units, so we know our neighbors very well. I am very friendly with the couple that lives across the hall. I’m single, and they often invite me to dinner with them. I hang out with the husband pretty often. 
We have game nights, and hang out at bars together. A few days before Christmas I saw another male come and pick up the wife while the husband was at work. They went out for a couple of hours and came back. I saw them hugging. I told him to come by my house when he got off of work for a beer so that I could tell him what I saw. Later that evening I told him and he didn’t believe me. He was devastated, and went to confront his wife. 
They got into a big fight, but in the end it turned out just to be a cousin that came in from out of town to visit her. They went out for lunch. He and this cousin know each other, he was a groomsmen in his wedding. I apologized profusely to the wife and him. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for a friend. She was not having it and cursed me out. I told her that she was being extremely rude and hurtful. She doesn’t want me to hang out with her husband anymore, effectively ruining our friendship. Am I the asshole here or is she? I tried to apologize to her, and explain my reasoning. She wasn’t open to it at all. I don’t think that this is fair.",False,False,3,4,5,1,1,3,Loyalty,284
1,"AITA for taking my best friend on holiday instead of my girlfriend? | When I left my old school around 2 years ago me and my best friend decided that in 2 years time (after I finish school) that we would go on holiday together for 1 month to the Maldives, to catch up etc etc. I am much better off so I am paying for it all, meaning they haven't put anything into it, although I know they will pay for meals or whatnot whilst we're out there. Me and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and a half now, and we have already been on one week long trip together to France earlier this year. It was amazing. I leave for my trip in a few weeks time, and I told my girlfriend a few weeks ago too. However, ever since I told her, she has been extremely upset with me that I'm not taking her on such an amazing trip. There are 2 I have in my defence, firstly, although I wouldn't say this to her, but I don't think we're ready to spend a month together alone. Secondly, I think it's a dick move to cancel such a trip only a few weeks in advance because I know how much my friend is excited for it. Now, I only speak to my friend about once a week via text now because we live very far away now and so can't see each other (another reason why I'm excited), however, we were best friends for 16 years before this. I don't think I'm being unreasonable but some of my friends and my girlfriend say I'm the asshole. So?",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,284
1,"AITA for not lying to a friend about another friend who's girlfriend is pregnant? | So a buddy of mine named T told me that he believes another friend of mine named K is becoming a father. 

K's girlfriends mom posted something on FB saying some stupid corny shit about how she's going to be a grandmother. So I called K and just straight up asked him, he said yes but not to tell anyone.

Our friend group have known each other for about 11 years so we are all very close. Yesterday friend M and his girlfriend B and I went to the beach. B was asking me if I knew anything about if K's gf was pregnant because she also saw the FB post and had noticed that K's gf didnt drink at any of the past events. All I said is ""I can't answer that."" I've lied before about much smaller things but apart of me really wanted to tell them. They assumed because I can't answer that it is true, I never confirmed it and switched the subject.

M and B told K's gf that if she needed any help or just needed someone that they would be there for her. 

K msged me telling me how he can't trust me with any of his secrets, which I rebuttaled by saying that he didnt tell me it and that T and I had to figure the shit out on our own.

TL;DR: AITA for not lying to other friends and refusing to answer if I knew anything about if a friend's gf was pregnant.

My sister respond nicely saying "" nothing much just about to go home with my little brother he cant drive so I have to get him home.""

She said no but he kept prositsing until we got to the car when she started the car he said ""fine whatever whore"" I got out of the car right away and said ""the fuck you just called her say it again and see how I fucking slap the teeth out your fucking mouth"" then he said something along the lines of I cant do shit. Which i probably wouldn't he had like 40 pounds on me. But i still defended her until she got out of the car and yelled at me to get in the car which I did.

1,"AITA For spoiling a marriage proposal because my friend doesn't like to be surprised | My (28M) friend has a boyfriend that is planning on proposing. I've been childhood friends with her and she's not a fan of being surprised (she hates surprise parties/etc).

I know her boyfriend and he confided to me he is planning on proposing to her, he had an elaborate plan set up where they will go to a local city/dinner and he'll propose at a park or some shit. 

So the next time I saw my friend, I immediately told her about her boyfriend's plan and she was happy about it as she wanted to marry him. I told her not to tell the boyfriend and pretend to be surprised and she agreed. 

However it didn't go according to plan as my friend couldn't hold it in anymore and let it slip that she knows he is going to propose. The boyfriend confronted me and we had a huge argument. I told the boyfriend he should have taken into consideration that she doesn't like to be surprised.

My friend later told me she can't invite me to the wedding because of the argument, which I don't think is fair because I would go to support her. I called her boyfriend and after trying to understand his perspective, he was still not inviting me. I called him a massive prick for creating a wedge between me and my friend.",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,243
1,"AITA for choosing my friend’s wedding over my sister’s? | My friend Kelly recently announced she was engaged and asked me to be a bridesmaid, which I happily accepted. A month later, my sister Ashley and her boyfriend announced they were also engaged and had set their wedding date, which unfortunately falls on the same day as Kelly’s wedding next September. Kelly is getting married on the other side of the country, where her family lives, so it would be impossible to attend both weddings.

Ashley wants me to be her maid of honor, but I told her I was sorry and that I had already made a commitment to Kelly and it wouldn’t be right to back out. I asked if she would be willing to move her wedding date to a different weekend, and she said she can’t because she and her fiance already put down a nonrefundable deposit on the venue. 

Ashley is really upset with me because I’ve only known Kelly for a year and she thinks her wedding should take priority because she’s family. My parents agree with her and keep pressuring me to drop out of Kelly’s wedding. 

It's true that Kelly is a newer friend, but we’re extremely close and I can easily see this becoming a lifelong friendship. I promised her I would be her bridesmaid, and I want to keep my word. AITA?",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,232
1,"AITA for wanting to go to my brothers wedding even though my wife told me not to | So my brother is getting married in two weeks. The wedding is in LA where the rest of my family lives, my wife and I live on the east coast. I’m the best man.

My wife just recently got put in bed rest, and is 8 months pregnant. She said that I can’t go to the wedding. I can’t just skip my brothers wedding. Especially when I’m the best man. The original plan was fly over two days early, stay three days and fly back. 

I’ve moved the flight to night of the day before and afternoon of the day after.

My wife is still saying I can’t go. Her friends are willing to come over and help, and worst come to worst her parents can drive up and stay a day or two. It’s not like she’ll be all alone.

I told her I can’t skip the wedding and that she’ll be fine and there are other people to help her. It’s only a day and a half, nothing’s going to happen.

She said that if I cared about her I would skip the wedding. I got pissed off and said she can think that if she wants but I’m going either way. She’s now only talking to me to demand water.

1,"AITA for telling my wife off for having her mom in the room when she was giving birth | My wife and I agreed from the beginning that we would be the only people in the room when she was going through labor/birth. Her mother and I also don’t get along very well, and neither of us wanted that stress the day of.

There was an issue and I was late getting to the hospital, not by a ton though. There was still 3+ hours of labor until the baby came. However, by the time I got there, my wife had called her mother and told her to come. It caused a lot of tension and made the process pretty uncomfortable for me, and thus made it harder to support my wife. We didn’t get that special one on one time with the baby either (we initially planned on having a full day of just us, but it ended up only being a few hours) and I’m really upset about it.
 
It’s been a few weeks and my wife asked me why I am so moody about the topic of the birth, and I exploded at her for violating the plan that we had from the beginning. She cried and blamed me for being late and then told me she wouldn’t discuss it further because I had yelled. AITA here??",False,False,3,4,5,3,1,4,Loyalty,230
1,"AITA for telling my bf I don't entirely trust him? | Ok so I've met some pretty good liars in my life. I've been through horrible situations where people lied to me for months and now I'm generally skeptical of people until proven otherwise.

My bf on the other hand is an innocent until proven guilty type of guy and he prides himself on his honesty and loyalty. He trusts me entirely and never made me feel uncomfortable. 

Well today it came out that I don't feel the same. I am actually uncomfortable with his 'no password sharing' policy and I do think he could either be a great, amazing person or an amazing liar. It just seems too convenient that someone who claims they never lie also has boundaries that mean I can never know whether or not they are lying. 

So while I told him I clearly trust him enough to take that risk, I can't be 100% sure of things. He flipped out, told me I'm insulting him and his integrity,character etc. He said he did nothing to deserve being not trusted. I told him it's not him, just my past, I trust him mostly but I can't help feeling some doubt. He's now very upset, demands an apology and that I trust him entirely. I'm not sure I can do that.

1,"AITA For Lying to My Wife to Help My Brother? | My brother has constantly told exaggerations and the boldest of lies to people. About 6 months ago he lied to me and my wife about having terminal cancer (it ended up being a dark spot on his brain and he said he freaked out about it).

He is dyslexic and has always struggled to hold a job because of his behavior. A few weeks ago he told me that his work would not accommodate his disability or let him transfer to other roles. I told him he should file an EEOC complaint and he asked if I could write one for him because of his awful grammar & spelling. I said sure. I didn’t tell my wife because I knew she would be really angry I helped out my brother, who has called us shitty people who never help him out and worse names when we pushed him for more proof on his cancer “exaggeration”.

She found out I offered to help him and is pissed at me for betraying her and that I could’ve jeopardized our family if he was lying and I wrote that letter.
