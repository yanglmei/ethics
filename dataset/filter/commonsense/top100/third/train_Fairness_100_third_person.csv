0,"AITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once they are married? A bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife his fiancée's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.

Now to them, Nick is 28, she is 26 and they have been dating for about 3.5 years now. They both have student loan debt up to their eyes and the only reason they have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way they could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt they both have.)

Her family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, Nick respects that and is super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing them out a few times when things got pretty bad.

So now to them, Nick proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and they all get along great. However.. last week his wife to be told Nick she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? They had their first major fight right there because they need her income to survive especially if they are going to have a kid in a year or so like they plan to.

Nick is not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on his income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of his. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? Nick also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a ""real school"". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.

Now Nick is not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.

However Nick cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. Nick gets that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but Nick is not wealthy enough to do that. They talked about doing that for 3-4 years once they have a kid because Nick does believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once their kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.

Now apparently that plan they had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because Nick popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took Nick out to drink and told Nick there will be no bad feelings if Nick backs out because Nick shouldn't be expected to do that unless Nick is in a financial position to do so.

AITA if Nick gives her an ultimatum to work or not get married? Nick also doesn't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, he just doesn't see that being healthy either.",False,False,4,5,2,3,1,4,Fairness,653
0,"AITA for Nick not wanting to look after his autistic younger cousin? |

Some background, his cousin is 16 and Nick is 20. Nick has always been fond of his cousin, they used to be really close, people would joke about them being brother and sister.

So, last week Nick's uncle called his mum to say that his aunt (who was a recovering alcoholic) had started drinking again and she's not getting out of bed, not showering, not helping to look after his cousin etc... and Nick just felt this immediate sense of dread because this same thing happened before. When Nick was 17 his nan got that same exact call, Nick offered to go with her to check up on his aunt and they ended up coming back with his cousin. Nick was pretty happy at first, he wasn't seeing much of his cousin at the time so it was nice to be able to spend time with him.

After a while, Nick realised that his mum had agreed to let him stay at their place while his uncle was trying to get help for his aunt in the hopes that Nick would be the one looking after him. Nick's mum was working full-time and his sister was away for the summer with a club, which left Nick as the obvious candidate as he was on his summer holidays. Nick didn't mind at first, it was nice having his cousin around but looking after him meant that Nick had to be with him all the time. Nick had to take him to the park, Nick had to bring him with him to hospital and dentist appointments (Nick was late in his recovery from surgery so he had a lot of follow-up appointments). From when his cousin woke up at about 5 in the morning until Nick's mum got home from work at 7, Nick had to be watching him. Nick couldn't go out with friends, couldn't even have friends over otherwise his cousin would kick up a fuss. The only alone time Nick had was at night which is when he likes to go on his laptop, listen to music, do some writing but by that time he was too tired to do any of that. There were times when Nick would catch him masturbating, not even accidentally walking in on him but his cousin would do it in the open in the living room, would shove his hands down his pants when they were out in public. Nick would tell him not to do it, he would say sorry but carry on.

That was Nick's whole summer. He was stressed, he was missing out on a lot and he was missing his friends, his mum kept telling him that it wasn't for long, that they were doing it for his aunt. His cousin was here for over 6 weeks. That's the experience that turned Nick off of wanting to look after him again.

Nick's mum got in touch, told him it's happening again and if he can come home for a week or so to help look after his cousin. Nick just straight up told her no. He's older now, he's living away from home, he's a student working part-time with amazing friends. He told her that he has a life of his own now, he can't just drop everything and come home to look after his cousin. She got really upset with him and told him he's being selfish because she has to work and look after his sister (who's now the same age Nick was when the responsibilty was dumped on him). Nick told her that it's not fair to just expect him to do it and then hung up on her. He's been trying to forget about it but a part of him feels bad.

0,"AITA for Nick being pissed off at his mom's boyfriend and expecting him to ask to watch tv? | Nick's mom has been with her boyfriend around 6-7 years, they fight most of the time and every so often they have massive blow-up fights that get ugly. They fight about the same things all the time and it's just a vicious, repetitive cycle. They become verbally abusive to each other and have gotten physical in the past.

In the 3 months Nick had been living with them, maybe 4-5 times Nick had been watching tv when the boyfriend came home. He usually gets home around 4:30 but sometimes shows up whenever. One night around 7:30 Nick's mom and Nick were sitting in the kitchen and Nick put a hockey game on, the boyfriend came home, didn't say anything to either of them, walked to the couch, picked up the remote and changed the channel without even asking if they were watching anything. Another time Nick was off work for the day and it was 2 in the afternoon and the boyfriend came home and went upstairs for the rest of the night apparently because Nick was watching tv, but if he said he wanted to watch Nick would have let him have the tv. Nick's sister made a huge deal that Nick was in the boyfriend's space and shouldn't be watching tv, and Nick's mom said whenever the boyfriend comes home Nick should just go to the basement. Nick said it's unfair that everyone should have to bend to the boyfriend's will just because he gets upset at the smallest things, and he could just say he wanted to watch tv and Nick would have no problem. Nick's mom agreed with Nick that the boyfriend was being ridiculous and rude, and Nick said he would not let the boyfriend get whatever he wants just because he's a baby about it.

So fast forward a bit and the 2 of them were fighting again and the boyfriend called Nick's mother a whore among other things, Nick guesses his tv watching was somehow a part of it as well. They got into a massive fight when Nick was out of the house for an entire day, Nick's mom said she ripped his shirt and the dog gate to the kitchen was smashed and she told Nick Nick had gotten his wish because the boyfriend might never be coming back. Shame on Nick for thinking his mom had finally come to her senses because it lasted about 2 1/2 weeks and then a couple days ago she told Nick he was coming back and all of a sudden was framing it like Nick watching tv was the only reason they had fought and Nick was the issue. Nick told his mom he was just not going to up and leave whenever the boyfriend got home, and if the boyfriend wanted the tv and Nick was watching something, then he could say so and Nick would have no issue. Apparently this was way out of line on Nick's end and now Nick's mom was telling the boyfriend she hated Nick, that Nick was lazy and Nick deserved nothing. Nick was really confused by this 180 because she had no problem agreeing with what Nick said 2 weeks prior, but now her and Nick's sister were painting Nick as the villain.

That morning the boyfriend tried to tell Nick that what him and Nick's mom had was ""different"" and that he cares for her deeply, and Nick could use whatever he wanted, but to understand that it's his space. Nick told him ""Nick doesn't care for you because you called Nick's mother a whore"" and left, he hadn't said anything to Nick since and Nick's mom hadn't spoken to Nick since he came back and Nick was left wondering how he was the bad guy.

0,"AITA for abandoning Nick's friend and her kids? Nick had a friend who was renting a house and was going to need a new roommate soon, as long as Nick was ok couch surfing for the first month since Nick just lost his apartment due to money issues after losing his full time job. It was $800 a month for a room in the basement and a private bathroom. That included utilities and internet. Only other stipulation is she would need help feeding her kids (13f & 15m) here and there.

While Nick worked 2 jobs Nick wasn’t exactly rolling in dough as both jobs weren’t great. As time goes on Nick goes from feeding her kids sometimes to being the one to feed them and if Nick didn’t then they may not eat. It got worse to the point where Nick was working 2 physically demanding jobs on less than 1000 calories worth of food a day. Nick was literally starving and trying to push what Nick could to feed the kids. Nick worked his ass off trying to find a better job and was able to get something finally.

Suddenly the person paying the internet bill decided he wanted to move out with little warning and it fell to Nick to take care of it. When he came back he never took it back over. So now Nick is paying close to $900 a month plus a massive food bill. Nick's sister has been asking Nick if Nick wants to live with her because she knows Nick has been in a bad way and Nick's depression is getting worse since Nick could no longer afford therapy. April rolls around and it’s time to renew the lease, the roommate who invited Nick is lamenting she wants to move out but is trying to find someone to take her spot. At this point she has been out of work due to TIA and FM and claims she can’t afford rent anymore. Nick says let’s sit down and look at the bills and see what’s can be done to balance things out for her and that’s when the other shoe drops.

The whole time she has been paying about $600 a month for three bedrooms (the house has 5 bedrooms), one for her with a private bathroom and 1 each for the kids. She made as much as Nick did before being on disability so why was Nick paying $300 more than anyone in the house on top of food costs for two teenagers? Add on the fact that she has Ipsy, other subscription boxes and constantly getting packages from Amazon but can’t feed her own kids even the basics.

Nick says nothing but decides since it turns out Nick was never added to the lease Nick can go whenever. Nick talks to his sister and they plan for Nick to move in at the end of June. Once the date is set Nick lets his roommate know she has a little more than 2 1/2 months to find someone to take over Nick's spot and Nick needed to get himself on track to getting out on his own again. She is mad Nick would leave them in the lurch like this even though Nick gave her so much time find someone else to move in.

Come October she lets Nick know she and the others were abandoning the house. Nick knows she blames Nick moving out for the upheaval (they did find someone else to take Nick's room but they weren’t willing to take the extra responsibilities). So is Nick the asshole for moving out knowing she wasn’t going to feed her kids and lose the house?",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness,617
0,"AITA For Nick Wanting to Cut His Sister Out of His Life? | Nick is 31 and his sister is 38 and lives with his parents. Things really started to come to a head about 4 years ago when Nick's oldest son was born. He was 2 weeks early and the doctors wanted him to stay in the NICU (ultimately for about 10 days). Nick and his wife decided that they didn't want anyone to visit at the hospital because among other things it was very overwhelming. Nick's sister then proceeds to guilt Nick into letting her make him host them at Nick and his wife's house while Nick's wife stays at the hospital. During said visit Nick's sister (who didn't have a serious boyfriend) says to Nick that she is really jealous of Nick and his wife. Nick felt this was kind of inappropriate but decided to let it pass.

Now Nick's sister lives with Nick's parents rent free with her son.

Fast forward to fall of last year, and Nick's parents decided that they were going to sell their RV trailer because they needed a bigger one so Nick's sister and her son could come with them. Nick and his wife had been looking for an RV trailer for a while and offered to buy it, matching the highest offer they had been given thus far. Nick and his wife decided to keep the trailer at Nick's parents house over winter. Come March, Nick and his wife discovered she was pregnant. They decided that since it would be difficult to have a toddler and 2 infants in the trailer, they should sell the trailer and use the money as a down payment on a minivan. Nick told his parents and his sister this plan and Nick's sister offers to sell it for them so they don't have to bother bringing it to their home several hours away.

Nick's sister sold the trailer for double and transfers Nick the money but it's only what they paid for the trailer initially. Nick asks her why she isn't giving him the whole amount, she says they got the family discount. Nick brings this up to his parents who tell him that his sister needs the money and he should just drop it. Nick is angry but decides it's not worth it since his parents are clearly on her side.

It seems fairly insignificant but Disney plus comes out and Nick has 2 newborns at home and his sister calls him up and tells him that he needs to share their Disney plus password and tells him that he owes her his password since he used to use their netflix while he was in college. When Nick said no they got upset and called him ungrateful and said he was taking advantage of his parents.

Almost 2 months later Nick's mother won't speak to him, because of ""how he treated her and his sister"". Nick's sister has called and berated him for upsetting her and his mother and called him ungrateful and things that would make a sailor blush.

Nick finally decided that he was going to cut her out of his life when his dad calls and says that even though Nick doesn't own ""all the blame"" he needs to get over it and make up with his sister, because he and Nick's mother were upset they had yet to visit Nick's twins despite them being almost 3 months old. When Nick explained to him that the 2 of them were more than welcome to visit anytime they wanted, he told Nick that they were a family and if she wasn't welcome, they weren't coming without her.

0,"Is Judy the asshole for not aligning with Judy's in-law’s expectations of gender roles and asking Judy's husband to stay home when their sitter calls off? | Backstory: Judy's FIL and Judy's husband are EQUAL business partners of a collision shop. Judy's FIL is the lead when it comes to “back of the house” and Judy's husband is the lead in “front of the house.” They also have two employees working for them, so everything runs real smoothly there and even if someone doesn’t show up, the shop can still run efficiently.

Judy works as a graphic designer in a VERY small vehicle wrap and sign shop with a total of 3 employees including Judy herself. Judy gets paid well, Judy gets a lot of leniency when it comes to anything at the shop. Basically, Judy can do what Judy wants as Judy's job is getting done during business hours. Judy spent years on a degree, which Judy admits Judy did not need, however, Judy is so proud of Judy's work and Judy loves Judy's job. The shop falls behind if Judy doesn’t get Judy's tasks completed.

Judy and Judy's husband had their first/last baby in May 2019. Judy decided to return PART TIME after maternity leave despite the need for Judy to come back full time. If Judy crams an entire weeks worth of work into Monday through Wednesday Judy still fills the position effectively and Judy is still valued. This lets Judy stay home Thursday and Friday without the worry of childcare. Judy's mother watches their baby otherwise because she asked to. Well, while Judy really appreciates Judy's mom, she is super flaky, Judy expected her to be. She’s good for canceling 2-3 times a month on Judy. So Judy actually has 2 backup sitters, because if Judy misses a day of work Judy sets the whole shop back.

Forward to their recent family debate, argument and eventually Judy's blow-up: TWICE NOW all three of Judy's sitters have been unavailable and it has come down to Judy or Judy's husband staying home with their kid. Judy's husband wouldn’t mind staying home, he’s not the problem. Judy's FIL straight up looked Judy in the face and said to Judy, “you are the woman and the mother, it is your responsibility to stay home if you do not have a sitter.” Judy is sorry but Judy doesn’t feel this way. Judy told Judy's FIL as nicely as Judy could that Judy's husband chose to make this baby too and it was also Judy's husband's responsibility. Judy's FIL literally laughed in Judy's face and that’s what pissed Judy off... Judy argued with Judy's FIL that they are living in fucking 2020 and that Judy's FIL's beliefs on gender roles are fucking stupid. Judy already (and happily) misses out on two days of work. Judy needs to be reliable for the other three days Judy is scheduled to be there so that Judy is not replaced. Judy's husband can’t be fired from Judy's husband's own business and it’s not like Judy and Judy's husband lose money if Judy's husband takes a day off occasionally on the freak occurrence that all 3 sitter options are unavailable. Judy screamed at Judy's FIL that Judy was sacrificing a lot for Judy's child but Judy wasn’t going to give up something Judy loves so much. Judy called Judy's FIL an asshole as Judy's FIL shook Judy's FIL's head and Judy slammed the door. Nothing like this has ever happened, Judy's FIL has been very supportive the whole 10 years Judy has been apart of the family but this seems like a no-brainer to Judy.

0,"AITA for unintentionally causing a girl to lose her babysitting job? | FF = Family friends

CB = Careless Babysitter

So, Nick and his family are staying at FFs house because their wedding is tomorrow, and they've been here for about 5 days. FFs have 3 kids, who are extremely misbehaved and they're a lot to handle. Nick is also sick, so that adds even more difficulty to the situation.

For the majority of the time Nick has been here, Nick has been babysitting the three kids and his siblings by Nick while FFs and his parents prepare for the wedding. The kids as Nick said are very misbehaved, and they prompt the other two to act up as well. They scream, argue, cry, and generally don't listen to Nick when Nick tells them to do anything. FFs have a gym set that they're not allowed to climb on, and because they don't listen when Nick tells them to get off, Nick has to run back and forth to actually pick them up off the equipment. They get his brother, who has ADHD riled up as well, and then his brother encourages his sister to join in, so Nick ends up having to control five misbehaving children who don't listen to Nick whatsoever.

When FFs came home Nick explained the situation to them and they said that they would get another babysitter to help Nick out with the kids when they go out for dinner. Nick was incredibly thankful. They went out for dinner and CB showed up. The first thing she did was drop her bag in the middle of the living room and sit down on her phone. The kids were going wild as always but this time it was literally happening all around her and she was doing nothing to stop it. This carried on the entire night, and not once did she step in to help. She actually found out that Nick was sick around halfway through the night because she came upstairs to use the bathroom while Nick was up there vomiting. Nick kinda hoped she would start helping Nick after seeing that Nick was unwell, but she continued to ignore the chaos going on around her and ultimately left Nick to do all the work.

Nearing the end of the night, Nick asked CB to help Nick get the oldest child to go to sleep. He wouldn't listen to Nick at all. He just screamed at the top of his lungs and threw a tantrum on his bed. She told Nick she'd be up in a minute and that she was just facetiming her friend real quick. Nick was angered and Nick knew she wasn't gonna do anything, so Nick managed to get him to bed himself.

FFs come home, and talk to CB. They then pay CB $100 for ""babysitting"" their kids, and Nick got nothing. So before she left, Nick told them Nick had actually done everything, and added that she knew Nick wasn't feeling well but still left all the work up to Nick. She called Nick an ass and told Nick that Nick only ratted her out because Nick was ""entitled"" and ""wanted her money."" It has some truth to it Nick guesses because Nick didn't think it'd be fair if Nick was the one working Nick's ass off but yet got nothing while the one who sat on her ass got paid. They ended up asking the kids the next morning if CB paid attention to them, all of which said no. They apologized to Nick and called CB's parents to tell them that she was fired.

0,"AITA for not paying Nick's aunt's phone bill? | For most of Nick's life, his aunt has a difficult time listening to Nick. If Nick's upset about how she's talking to him and voices it, she brushes it off and says Nick's being too sensitive. If Nick's telling a story, she'll interrupt and ask something that had already been said.

If Nick tells her not to give bad foods to the dogs, she'll go ahead and do it behind Nick's back. Nick's mom has had 4 strokes in the last 6 years, and Nick has been trying to get her to eat healthy. Every 6 months is a conversation about not buying french fries, soda, etc. Just recently, Nick's mom had a check up where her cholesterol was through the roof, and Nick had a conversation again about not buying all that crap. When Nick confronts his aunt about it, she says that ""it's only one time"". It stops for a while, and then it continues. She also listens to other people before Nick, even though Nick has backed up his POV with facts and sources.

Sunday was Nick's mom's birthday, and Nick told his aunt a week before to buy a vanilla cake from a specific store because Nick's mom likes their vanilla cakes. Nick also tells her not to buy bad food. She agrees. Sunday comes and she calls Nick from another store asking what flavor. Nick says vanilla, but that isn't the store Nick told her to go to. She says that she had plans for that day and she wasn't going to go out of her way to go to some other store to get a cake. Nick responds by saying that he had told her a week ago and that she said agreed to it, and her response was that Nick's overreacting.

When she came home, she has the cake, along with a bag of french fries and soda. Nick asks her about it. She says that it's only for her birthday, and Nick says that that's why the cake was allowed. Plus, Nick had asked her not to buy other crap. She waves Nick off.

Later on, after they've sung happy birthday, Nick sees his aunt sneakily giving Nick's dog cake, using her body to block Nick's view. Nick tells her that she's going to kill Nick's dog. And she says that Nick's just overreacting. Nick just went to his room, and slammed the door closed.

Every time she doesn't listen to Nick, it gets increasingly worse. It went from being civil, to Nick making petty and shady comments, to just screaming and now slamming things.

So Nick decided to no longer give her money. Monday, Nick's mom and aunt were talking about his aunt's phone service. It had been cut off because she didn't pay the $80. Today, while Nick's at work and more inclined to say yes to things because he doesn't want attention, Nick's mom calls. She asks if Nick can pay for his aunt's phone bill, and Nick says no. When Nick tried to explain to her why, his mom interrupts Nick and starts saying that she was Nick's aunt and family. Nick tells her that he's trying to say why and she's not letting Nick. Nick's mom ignores it and asks if Nick was going to pay for the bill, and Nick says no. She said thank you and hung up on Nick.

**TL;DR**: Nick doesn't want to pay for his aunt's phone bill because Nick feels like she's not treating him with enough respect to value how Nick feels and thinks.

0,"WIBTA if Nick took his Netflix away from his parents and deleting his Spotify account for them stealing his Spotify? | Throwaway for Nick's AITA posts. 15 Male for context, so sorry if Nick makes high school level grammatical errors and such. Also for later in the story, keep in mind Nick's mother has his e-mail monitored so she can see whatever e-mail Nick receives. Nick has always loved music, tv, and movies. So both Netflix and Spotify are no-brainers for a guy like Nick. Nick decided to cut a deal with his parents (in 2017 when he got it) and make it so that when he worked at his volunteer job, they would pay him minimum wage (USD 7.25). The first thing Nick decided to spend his well-earned money on was a Spotify Premium subscription. The counter was that it would have to be billed from his parent's bank account for the time being as Nick is not legally allowed to open one in his state due to the fact he is under 16. Nick's parents accepted the offer and so they subtracted $15 from his monthly wage to pay for his Spotify as time continued.

Nick's grandparents are cool as far as grandparents go. They love video games, music, movies, and all of the other things Nick likes. Eventually, in 2018, they decided to get a Netflix subscription for them and Nick. Soon, Nick decided to ask his grandparents if he could put the account on to his parent's tv service so his family and he could watch anything they so desired, they accepted to his surprise. Nick, therefore, did what he got permission to do and put their account on to his parent's living room TV so they could watch more media.

Fast forward to now, Nick's mother ends up changing his Spotify password so she can use it to listen to music in the car(even though she has been perfectly content with using the radio for years!). Nick doesn't mind the fact that she wants to listen to music, but he pays for that with his own money and her taste in music and his are very different (Nick likes old stuff from the 1930s all the way to the 1980s while she prefers the stuff most people listen to nowadays, which is not the kind of thing Nick can stand to listen to{not to offend anyone}). Also, she listens to it ALL DAY and Spotify only allows your account to be used once at a time. So now Nick keeps getting recommended rap music, his friends keep questioning his apparent change in taste of music, and he can't listen to music on his account as his mother keeps stealing it. Whenever Nick talks to her about it, she says that she pays for it so she gets to use it. Which is not true!^^

(Side note: they also are annoyed Nick won't give them the password to the Netflix so they can use it on their other devices)

So, Nick has been thinking, and he believes he has a fair plan. Nick's grandparents are fine with him paying them money to support his Spotify account until he can get a bank account. So Nick personally sees it fit to delete his Spotify account, start a new personal e-mail to run a new one and other services off of, and delete the Netflix from the Living Room TV. Does this seem a fair punishment to them after he has asked them to stop using something he pays for and they get greedy with the Netflix they don't own?

Judy could go on and on about his convincing speech. Judy should also mention that Judy's father lives with Judy and her husband at the moment and yes he helps with bills. Judy asked him ""I'm on board if you help watch the puppy and pitch in, it's basically your dog after all.."" He swore up and down he'd help out, by taking it on walks etc. So fast forward, he gets Judy's daughter a cute female cockapoo. Judy's daughter is overjoyed, cuddles and kisses the damn thing constantly. Sometimes Judy and her husband have to pry the dog off Judy's daughter so she can eat and go to sleep. Both Judy's husband and Judy got all the essentials out of their own pockets. Dog crate, food, puppy pads, shampoo, treats, brush, lysol and paper towels to clean up the messes...omg the messes..ugh...
Everything good right? Wrong...because lets just say this entire month Judy's father showed his true colors. He refuses to take her out because ""ugh i'm too old for this shit, she's too hyper for me to walk her..."" Judy and her husband are the ONLY ones who take her on walks and clean up her poop and pee when she goes indoors. It mostly falls on Judy because Judy stays at home while Judy's husband works. Judy is the one who feeds her, cleans when she knocks down their trash can. The one who has to get her away from things she tries to eat...the one who needs to be with her at all times because he got a puppy with separation anxiety... and at night she jumps on Judy and her husband's bed because if they leave her out in her crate she barks and cries like crazy and no one can sleep. Judy's father sleeps like a rock all night meanwhile Judy gets up at 2 am every night with an alarm to allow the puppy to pee and poo so it doesnt go on their bed. Judy keeps telling Judy's self Judy is doing it for Judy's daughter...Judy is doing this for her....Judy is doing this for her....

Well, today what set Judy off was that its the first day of school for Judy's daughter.

0,"Nick was an asshole for asking for repayment after supporting everyone for 5 months? |

In September Nick's partner was in an accident. A week later the partner came home and absolutely demanded Nick sell Nick's car. The partner was extremely clear that it was to be sold. Nick's car was definitely running but not in the best shape of its life. But Nick was still driving it. And Nick had been going back and forth about weather Nick wanted to sell or fix. Nick was currently on wanting to fix, even going as far as asking the partner how hard it would be to fix themselves, watching a few videos about it, and looking at prices for parts. The partner was aware of Nick's feelings, Nick involved the partner totally.

Well exactly one day after selling Nick's beloved car the partner comes home and tells Nick the partner was not able to work anymore as the partner was in too much pain. Nick was not aware the partner was in that much pain as the partner made no effort to get looked at prior to this convo. The partner said the partner had been in similar pain for years and made no effort to get checked out before all this despite having excellent health coverage. The partner only said the partner was in more pain. Nick found it odd that it was so conveniently after Nick had just received quite a bit of money for Nick's car. But Nick did not mention Nick's feeling about that at the time, but Nick had now. But the partner promised that Nick could just get another car.

But as time went on and Nick tried to actually get another car, the partner shot down every car Nick suggested. Right from a decent used car from a dealership to craigslist and facebook jalopies. All this was happening while Nick was slowly depleting the money Nick had for another car by supporting their household because Nick didn't make enough to support everyone on Nick's paycheck alone. Before this all happened the expenses were split pretty 50/50. The partner had always known that Nick couldn't support them all by Nickself. So in theory it'd have been very bad for the partner to be out of work. Had Nick not sold Nick's car.

Now that the partner was ready to rejoin the workforce and received the partner's lost wages for the last 5 months, they had been talking about all the late bills they would need to catch up on. And another car. Because now the partner needed the car they did have. While Nick was left out in the literal cold to bum rides home from work and uber, which was further depleting Nick's savings.

So when Nick asked if they would be getting Nick another car, the partner blew up. The partner was even calling Nick mean names. After awhile Nick couldn't take the mindfuck anymore and started calling the partner names back, Nick did admit. The partner said Nick was being greedy for asking and Nick should just save up on Nick's own if Nick wanted another car. How Nick was the one that had wanted to sell Nick's car. The partner started saying if Nick wanted Nick could have gotten another car anytime Nick wanted. The partner said Nick showing the partner cars that were in Nick's price range never happened. And that Nick was constantly treating the partner like shit for asking the partner to take some of the stress off Nick by trying to make money anyway the partner could or doing chores around the house.

Nick had literally spent all the money Nick had set aside for another car to take care of them while the partner was not working. Was Nick the asshole for expecting the partner to repay Nick by helping with a down payment?",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness,595
0,"WIBTA for Nick telling his roommate to remove his belongings from the room Nick pays for? | Nick lives in a 3 bedroom (2 upstairs, 1 downstairs) house with 2 room mates, one of which is his partner. Nick was the last roomie to move in when their previous friend moved out. When he came into the house he assumed all of the old room mates bills for internet, utilities, rent, etc. Their room mate (T) lives in one of the bedrooms upstairs and Nick's partner and he sleep in the bedroom downstairs together, and Nick has kept the other room upstairs (that is technically the room that he is renting) as mostly a sensory/decompression/meditation/reading/crafting space that doubles as a guest bedroom for when friends come over. It doesn't have a lot of things in it, just a mattress and some personal items of his that he uses during his personal time. T is a bit of a hoarder and has stuff overflowing from his bedroom (upstairs) into the hallway, lining his living room space, stuffing his cabinet space, the garage etc. Nick doesn't mind the clutter as T keeps it organized and keeps it in his own spaces.

Nick had fallen into a depressive state the last few months and had not been using the room much because he had lacked the motivation to do the things he enjoys.

Upon going upstairs he saw that T has started moving his crafting supplies into the room, completely lining one of the walls and making the room smell of leather, dye and other unpleasant chemicals. Nick was never told, asked or even aware that T had started doing this or when exactly it occurred. T's crafting supplies also fill the garage, upstairs hallway and most of his own personal space. It had even been brought up in the past when T asked a few months ago what they plan on using the room for and suggested a crafting room and T was told sorry, no, it would be a personal decompression space.

Nick is a person that takes his coziness very seriously and he can not use the room for its purposes when he can barely breathe when he walks into the room, so just pretending it isn't there is not going to work for him unfortunately. The room may not have been used much over the last several weeks, but he does not believe that makes it free storage space. Luckily, he is also on the tail end of this depressive cycle and can see the room being in use in the very near future for his own projects. He is at the point of telling T to remove his belongings or be prepared to pay for that space's rent as well (he wouldn't put his portion of rent on T just for the room, but he thinks T absolutely should be paying more rent for using more space.) Nick has been forgiving about the space T and his belongings take up until this point, but he thinks he has reached his limit on this one. He does not know if T took it upon himself to move his things in there or if T asked Nick's partner who said he could (still waiting on an answer before Nick tells T to remove his things) but he doesn't think that really matters, if T was told yes it was a miscommunication and the situation still needs to be rectified.

T needs to move his stuff, or he needs to pay more rent. AITA?",False,False,3,5,2,4,2,4,Fairness,595
0,"AITA for getting mad when Judy's parents use her money to pay bills? | So first post here, a little context. Judy (21f) lives with her parents since they agreed to pay for her schooling as long as she didn’t move out. They’re helicopter parents, and even went so far as to buy her a car as a bribe to stay local for college. Judy works part time as a ride operator at a theme park centered around plastic brick toys (since she’s a full time student), and while she doesn’t make nearly enough to be able to move out on this salary, she’s putting nearly all of it away into savings so she can move out. Judy's parents have always been very overbearing, going so far as to demand access to her bank account so they can “monitor her spending”. When Judy first opened her current account at 18, she asked the banker if they would be able to take money out of her account, and she assured Judy that they would only be able to put money in.

Fast forward to today. Judy was helping her mom with laundry, and her dad brought up the stimulus check that he just received, and how he’s using it to pay off bills due this month. Judy made a comment about how it’s good that they’re going to be able to pay this month, because of reduced income. Then he hits her with the bombshell.

Dad: Oh I wasn’t really all that worried. If I needed the cash, I was just going to pull it out of your account.
Judy: .......what?
Dad: Yeah, and the best part is you don’t even notice! I pay it back anyway. Eventually...
Judy: That money is what I’m saving up to be able to move out once I graduate! When I started this job you said I should put it away and not touch it!
Dad: I said you shouldn’t touch it. Not that I wouldn’t. Besides, if you want to keep driving that car, and using that phone, you’ll have to just let me take it.

Judy got upset by this and refused to continue the conversation. While it’s true that her parents bought her the car, her dad did tell her that she would only be allowed to keep it if she kept living with them, and went to college for what they wanted. And her phone, well Judy didn’t see anything wrong with the old one she had that she paid for. The current one Judy has was supposedly a Christmas present. Judy does use the electricity and water and such in the house, but never have they indicated that Judy needed to pay her share in it. If they had Judy would have been understanding, if less enthused, but then Judy would at least have a baseline for what she’s paying them. So far Judy’s seen charges on her account from them ranging from 200 dollars to 800 dollars, and doing the math on the deposits they make, she’s still several hundred dollars short. This would be fine if they would just charge her rent, but going behind her back like this feels like theft...

Judy hasn’t brought it up to her parents since, but it really bothers her that they essentially consider her savings to be a resource for them to use since they can’t manage their money effectively.

0,"AITA For moving countries when Judy's friend is a single mother and relying on her | So this is a throwaway

Judy is just gonna jump right into the story:

Judy (29F) has a friend (28F) Judy will call Stacy here. Stacy and Judy have been friends for over a decade now and Judy does love Stacy, Judy would say Stacy is one of Judy's best friends. Stacy got pregnant by a fling about five years ago and decided to go on with the pregnancy and keep the child, although it was clear from the beginning that the father would not be in this kid's life. He has nothing to do with the kid or Stacy.

Judy is childfree. Judy gets along with kids well, but Judy never wanted any of Judy's own, because Judy doesn't like how they affect everything one does in life.

While Stacy was pregnant Judy's roommate at that time moved out and Stacy asked to move in, just for about one year til Stacy gets back on Stacy's feet. To be honest Judy did not like the idea of living with a newborn at all, but Stacy was desperate and Judy wanted to be a good friend. Stacy moved in while Stacy was in the last trimester of Stacy's pregnancy. Judy helped Stacy a lot, Judy was with Stacy when Stacy gave birth and basically helped Stacy raise this child, who is now four years old. Stacy did not have a job at that time, so Judy was paying rent and for almost everything else Stacy and the kid needed; Stacy got a little help from the state, but in Judy and Stacy's country if one lives together one is on the hook, so most expenses were covered by Judy. This was pretty expensive, but Judy pulled through, because Judy wanted to be a good friend. Back then Judy just got Judy's degree and started working, so Judy earned money and Judy and Stacy managed. Judy loves Stacy and the kid and Judy always wanted to help them, but Judy will be honest and admit that this made Judy somewhat resentful. Judy never wanted kids and is now financing and supporting a child Judy never decided to have. Stacy always found a reason why Stacy could not move out and Judy let it slide.

This affects Judy a lot; Judy does a lot of childcare for Stacy, Judy has way less free time than Judy would have if there wasn’t a kid living with Judy and Judy has way more expenses, because although Stacy has a job now, Judy covers way more of Judy and Stacy's bills than Stacy does.

Judy always had this dream of moving to a specific country and decided Judy will do it as soon as this situation Judy and Stacy are in right now allows it. Last week Judy talked to Stacy about it and told Stacy. Since this was always Judy's plan Judy expected Stacy to somehow understand. Stacy flipped at Judy. Stacy cried and screamed how Judy cannot leave Stacy and the kid, how Stacy cannot raise a kid on Stacy's own, how Stacy does not want to be a single mother, how Stacy cannot pay all the bills. Stacy said Judy is running away from responsibilities. This made Judy so angry. This is not Judy's kid, Stacy IS a single mother, Judy never wanted a child and this child should not be Judy's responsibility.

0,"AITA For not letting Nick's niece stay over with him? | Ok, so let Nick preface this by saying that Nick absolutely loves his eldest niece (we'll call her ''M''), she's like Nick's little sister. But Nick's sister (her mom, we'll call her ''G'') takes advantage of that.

A little bit of backstory: ''G'' is married to this terrible guy 10 years younger than her and they have two girls under the age of 3 (''M'' is not his daughter). He's straight up not a nice guy, and complains all the time about having to take care of the two little girls and about ''M'' on a regular basis. Also, everyone in Nick's family is a musician, meaning they work all day saturdays, and they're split into two groups ''M'' is in one, and ''G'' is in another one. ''G'' lives with Nick's niece ''M'', the two girls and her husband in their own house. In Nick's house there are currently 10 people living there.

Now, here goes:

Nick loves it when ''M'' stays over. When she does, they sleep in Nick's queen size bed, which Nick has to tidy up when she sleeps over, and Nick has no issue cleaning up his bed when she's staying under a direct invitation from Nick (they go to a lot of cons and outings that require her to stay over out of convenience). The big but, is that when they're working on saturdays ''G'' takes off and goes home and leaves ''M'' there, with no regard of where she'll sleep, and she usually ends up sleeping with Nick, which means Nick has to clean up his bed even though Nick was not expecting ''M'' to stay over. Mind you, they regularly finish working late, so this happens at like 1 or 2 A.M. ''G'' says she's tired and wants to sleep, like Nick isn't tired too.

&#x200B;

''G'' does this almost every week without consulting anyone and ''M'' just shows up and stays because ''G'' couldn't be bothered to pick her up after work (it's a family business), and the only reason Nick puts up with it is because Nick doesn't want her sleeping on the couch, given the fact that they're so crowded in there. It's not just for work either, ''G'' will have ''M'' come over to Nick's house after a party, an outing, or something and she's just like ''Oh yeah, M is staying over. She's sleeping with you right?''

Nick feels like Nick is being taken advantage of for permitting this. Nick doesn't mind having his niece over, Nick loves her and Nick loves her company, but Nick doesn't enjoy that her mom just drops her off whenever she feels like it. Nick could have ''M'' sleeping in his bed for a month, if Nick is the one inviting her over, because when she stays over with Nick specifically, Nick takes care of her every need, and when ''G'' does this, Nick feels like Nick is being thrusted with a responsibility Nick doesn't want to take at the time. Nick can't possibly bring this up with ''G'' because if Nick does, she'll bad mouth Nick to ''M'' and Nick will be the bad guy. This has been going on for literal years, and yesterday Nick found himself in this exact situation and Nick said a firm ''No'' to ''M'' sleeping with him, resulting in her sleeping somewhere else in the house.

0,"AITA for holding this grudge against his dad from a decade ago | Ten years ago his stepmom accused Nick of stealing money from his stepbrother. Nick was 19 at that time, his stepbrother is a month younger. The whole thing was a set up, his stepmom told Nick it was. She and Nick had a fight the day before and she told Nick to just watch what she can do. The next day Nick got back from work and was met with the accusation that he had stolen thousands of dollars from his stepbrother. His parents kept their money in a lock box in their room with the key hidden. Nick also had a bank account so he had his own debit card for gas and a little spending money but 90% of his money went into the box. His stepmom claimed thousands of dollars were missing from his stepbrothers money in the lock box. After days of fighting it was determined that there was no proof Nick stole it but he would be punished anyway. His dad sat Nick down at the kitchen table to tell him his punishment as his stepmom stood behind him with the biggest smile,dancing and flipping him off. First was that they were cutting off paying for his college. They had already paid for his first and second semester at a community college but they took that money back out of his money. They also took away his debit card and gave him a strict allowance of only gas money to get to work, this included keeping track of his odometer calculating it down to the mile. This was to go on until he moved out which he did about a year later. 
News was spread around that Nick was a thief and friends and family distanced themselves, plus he could not go out with no money and being tracked. Nick was doing well in college but he was not allowed to go back until he moved out and could have control of his own money. There are many reasons Nick rarely has communicated with his parents the past 10 years but this is one of the bigger ones. His dad has been trying to get Nick to meet with him and talk things out, mostly because he wants to see his grandaghter. His brothers car broke down so Nick has been giving him rides to his parents house. This time Nick got stuck there talking to his dad. He asked Nick whats going on with Nick ignoring him and everything so Nick tried to talk. First thing Nick brought up was the situation explained above and his dad and brother laughed out loud at him. His dad said he cant believe Nick still thinks about that and that its a long time to hold something agaist him. Nick told him if they cant even get passed that theres no point talking and left. His brother texted Nick throughout the night and today trying to get him to come back and talk more, he says 10 years is a long time to hold that against their dad and Nick should leave it in the past. They say even with what happened its his own fault for not finishing college and moving out. Just thinking about it, 10 years does sound like a long time to hold on to somthing and plenty of people do put themselves through college under worse circumstances.

0,"AITA Nick's parents bought his younger sister with serious issues a 25k car for Christmas while all Nick got was a phone case. Nick had been needing a car for a couple of years. His parents had promised Nick one but gave his sister one instead. In Nick's family there are 2 kids (Nick's sister and Nick) and Nick's parents. Christmas was coming up and Nick had been wanting a car for about a year because Nick had recently gotten his Green P’s (an Australian thing that you can get when you’re older than 18). Nick's parents had mentioned in the past the idea of Nick paying for half and they’d cover the other half of a car under total 10k AUD. Nick could afford this as Nick had saved most of his money from the 2 jobs Nick had kept since he was 14, so no biggie. Nick had also been relying on his mum to drive him to work for the last 4 years, so it was a smart move on their end rather then driving Nick the 30 mins each way every shift Nick had.

Nick's sister had just turned 17, which is when you can get your red P’s in Australia. Nick's sister had never had a job and had no money saved whatsoever. Nick loved his sister a lot but his sister had made some questionable decisions toward her future lately, but that’s a separate story. Nick's parents hadn't seemed to care as much as they probably should have about these things and were acting like everything was normal and all good.

With Christmas coming up at the time and Nick's birthday in early January, Nick thought that might be the time his parents got him that car Nick had wanted for the last year, as they’d mentioned this idea for the last couple of months. Nick was obviously excited the week leading up to Christmas wondering what type of car they’d bought or what they were looking at.

Nick woke up Christmas Day around 10am to the sound of his younger sister crying but in a happy way. Nick was excited for his sister as she’d obviously gotten something she’d wanted. Nick walked downstairs and no one was at the Christmas tree, but a present with Nick's name was sitting there. Nick figured he’d come back to it after Nick found his parents. Nick checked the front door and it was wide open. Nick walked out to the drive way to see a brand new blue Hyundai i30 sitting in the driveway with a big ribbon on the front (around 25k). Nick's sister was at the side of it crying with his parents' arms around her. Nick asked who it was for and his parents told Nick it was for his sister. Nick probably could have handled that better but Nick stormed back into the house, closed his door and stayed in there for the rest of the day. Nick didn't go with his family to see everyone else for Christmas because of how annoyed Nick was.

Nick's parents asked Nick why he did that when they got home, so Nick asked them why they bought his sister a car before Nick, who was older, willing to pay half, had a job, went to school and had a stable plan for the future. They didn’t have an answer to that one so they just stayed quiet and after a couple of minutes of awkward silence they walked out. By that point Nick had forgotten about the present they left under the tree downstairs, so Nick walked down to open it. It was a new phone case from eBay, something Nick had no use for. Nick couldn't get over what they'd done.

Judy also wanted to relax and spend time alone. Recently Judy's older sister has gotten divorced and she’s switched from a part time job to a full time so she works during the morning.

Every day.. Monday through Friday Judy has to wake up around 6ish am to start her day of caring for her sister's child (2M). Judy takes care of him from 6ish am to around 5 pm. Sometimes 6 pm.. depending on who come gets him and when.

Judy thinks this is pretty unfair. Judy also wanted to get a job this summer to get some job experience but that plan was nipped in the bud. Judy loves her nephew. And Judy doesn’t mind watching him occasionally. But Judy is so tired of this. Judy has been doing this since she got out for the summer in May.

Judy doesn’t want to do this anymore. And Judy has expressed it plenty of times but Judy gets shut down every time by her parents because they say there’s no one else to do it.

Apparently Judy is an asshole for complaining and Judy gets hit with the life isn’t fair.

Judy is not trying to be insensitive towards her sister and Judy knows she’s having a hard time adjusting but fuck!

Judy thinks she is going to go crazy soon. Judy's daily schedule consists of waking up at 6. Taking his clothes off. If he cries when he gets there Judy deals with it. Judy makes his food and Judy feeds him. And then Judy attempts to get him to go back to sleep. Judy changes his diapers during these times and plays with him. Judy makes sure he goes outside at least a few times during the week. At some point he goes down for a nap and Judy continues to feed him.

He can only eat finger food by himself. Judy isn’t patient so Judy gets frustrated having to feed him by hand. It takes so long.

Judy also brushes his teeth, washes his face, and does his hair.

It sucks so much to be trapped with a toddler 5 days a week. At this point he’s seeing Judy more than he sees anyone else. Judy doesn’t have a child. Judy didn’t sign up for this.

Judy just wants to be irresponsible and sleep until 11 AM and play video games all day and chill with her friends. Maybe even work and make some money. Judy doesn’t want to be a mom.

Judy is a passive person. So dealing with tantrums and the crying is so hard. Judy keeps getting told by the adults around her to be more sympathetic toward her sister and that this will pass. But no one has made any plans to send him to a daycare.

So Judy has started complaining a lot and talking about how she wants to do this in hopes of another arrangement being made but Judy gets told to suck it up.

Even before Judy's sister got a divorce Judy would get tricked into watching her nephew for hours.

A can be a very nice, caring person and good listener but also selfish and entitled, especially when it comes to doing work for/with her. Also she's the type of person who will always ask for Nick's advice but will literally do the exact opposite of what Nick told her.

Actual story: about two weeks ago, they were at a club (basically their entire year was there, as they are graduating soon). Until 10pm, all cocktails were 50% off. Nick arrived at about 9:15. A greeted Nick by telling him that there was no space at her table for him, but no where else either as she hadn't reserved a seat for Nick (thanks, Nick guessed?). Afterwards, Nick immediately got in line for some drinks. A was right in front of him and at about 9:30 it was her turn to order. She ordered at least 15 cocktails. The bartender started taking her order and A was being an annoying customer. Why? While ordering A would ask what was in every single kind of cocktail and how it was made. This question-answer-game took about 5-10 minutes. Finally the bartender started making the drinks slowly.

A kept interrupting her and asking why she was doing whatever she was doing at that moment. Another 10 minutes pass and not even half the drinks are made. People in line are becoming impatient.
It's 9:45 and A looks at her watch, turns around to them and says in the most smug way possible with a grin on her face ""oh well, you guys only have 10 minutes left, you better hurry up"". Another five minutes pass. Again A turns around ""well, that'll be close for you"". At 9:58, all the drinks are made. All A had to do was pay. A and another girl decided to split the bill and started arguing about who would pay what.
9:59, they start getting their small change out. They pay all the drinks that way which takes at least another two minutes. Well, happy hour might be over, but this story sure isn't.
Nick decided to pull a Karen and wanted to speak to the manager, A friend and Nick went looking for him and they met A, who asked them what they were doing. Nick told her and she replied ""hm, at least I still got MY drinks, so I'm fine"" while grinning and trying to blow Nick a kiss. Nick slapped her hand away and told her to fuck off.

A later came up to Nick, telling him she's sorry Nick's upset but it's not her fault, The bartender was being fast and Nick shouldn't be mad. She then offered Nick one of her drinks that Nick could just pay her for. Nick refused.
About 20 minutes later A came to Nick and started yelling at him. She thinks it's stupid that Nick's upset about that, Nick told her to leave, she yelled that she wouldn't unless Nick wasn't upset anymore about something stupid like this. Nick lost it and also yelled at her, telling her to fuck off. She then returned to her table and loudly told people there how dumb Nick was being. Later she texted Nick, wanting to talk.

0,"AITA for not lending Judy's sister and her boyfriend money | Judy (19F) is a full-time student and works part-time and receives welfare from Judy's community at home. Judy makes around $800/month, but is very good when it comes to saving money and spending Judy's money wisely. This has led to Judy lending money to family members (parents/siblings) when they’re really struggling, but for Judy's parents and younger sister, they rarely ask (maybe once every couple of months) and always pay Judy back on the day they agreed on. On the other hand, Judy's older sister (22) and her boyfriend (~30) ask Judy for money multiple times a month, and when Judy does lend them money they never pay Judy back on time and then ask for more money just a few days later.

Recently, Judy's older sister and her boyfriend have been struggling a lot financially. Her boyfriend got into a car accident and was deemed at fault, so his insurance only covered a small amount of the damages. Due to this, he lost his only means of transportation and was no longer able to work. He applied for EI but hasn’t heard back yet. Judy's sister is on disability and receives enough to cover her rent, bills and food, with around $150 left for other expenses each month. They both smoke cigarettes and weed, and get take out for most meals, so they blow any extra money they have just a couple days after Judy's sister gets her cheque.

Since her boyfriend lost his job, he has been messaging Judy nonstop asking to lend him money. Judy explained to him that Judy only has enough in Judy's checking account to cover Judy's expenses until Judy's next payday, and if Judy touches Judy's savings Judy will get charged a fee for it, so Judy can lend him money when Judy gets paid next if he still needs it. He messaged Judy daily for the 5 next days asking over and over again for Judy to lend him anywhere from $50-200 and Judy told him the same thing each time.

Judy spoke to Judy's mom about it and Judy's mom told Judy that they have been doing the same to Judy's mom and Judy's dad and they have been saying no each time. Judy's mom has been helping them financially since they got together a few years ago and even let them live at Judy's parents house until they could afford an apartment. Both Judy's mom and Judy helped them with stuff for their apartment and Judy even took a day off to help them move. Judy's mom told Judy not to lend them money anymore, so they will learn to manage their money and save, rather than relying on Judy's family to help them whenever they are broke.

Judy got paid yesterday and woke up to a message from both of them asking Judy to lend them $200. Judy told them no, and that Judy wasn’t gonna lend them money anymore unless it was an emergency. This led to Judy's sister calling Judy and screaming at Judy over the phone saying Judy promised them Judy would help and all this stuff.

0,"AITA for not wanting to buy Judy's mom a house? | Basically, some stuff in Judy's childhood was pretty traumatizing and involved Judy's uncle.

Judy told Judy's mom by accident in March 2018. In summer 2019, Judy's mom wanted to begin a civil court case and Judy signed for Judy's mom to speak for Judy in court. Judy was grateful but a little uncomfortable with Judy's mom's need for vengeance. Judy's mom expressed Judy's mom wanted to ruin Judy's uncle financially. This used to be Judy's fantasy, but when Judy moved away for college in 2018 Judy finally felt peace and let it drop. During winter 2019 Judy's mom told Judy Judy's uncle had agreed to start negotiating a settlement.

Judy's mom started the conversation with “You have to trust me.” ... and talked about how money can split people apart. Judy's mom told Judy how much money Judy's mom hoped to get and how Judy's mom would insure the money‘s safety and Judy wouldn’t have full access since Judy’s young and stuff.

Judy's mom THEN started talking about how Judy's mom wanted to use the money to buy a house in another state so Judy's mom and Judy's sister can move away for a fresh start. Judy's mom made it sound like it would be an “investment” for Judy to be a “homeowner” but something doesn’t sit right with Judy. Judy didn’t like the idea of Judy's mom taking the settlement money (an uncertain quantity) to start a new life. Judy's mom kept saying “honey, I’ve never had my own house to live in, I’ve worked so hard my whole life with nothing to show for it, this house could make a difference”. Tbh, it feels like blood money to Judy and if Judy receives it, Judy wants to pay for Judy's schooling and save the rest for when Judy needs it. Judy doesn’t want a car/ new apartment. The money is tainted, yet Judy feels sickeningly entitled to it. Judy hadn’t aimed to gain money from the start, but now Judy feels like it’s Judy's. Judy suffered for it.

Judy is not against giving Judy's parents money. Judy’s been working full time since May 2019 to pay for college and support Judy. The settlement would cover Judy's tuition and pay off Judy's parents’s loans + some nice vacations or something.

Judy's mom pushed to take this to civil court; it feels to Judy like this was maybe Judy's mom's plan all along. Judy feels like Judy's mom is somehow profiting from Judy's pain and taking this as a “win” in Judy's mom's life.

Judy is still not sure about whether Judy's mom is capable of taking the money when it’s issued. Judy’s just stressed (the negotiations start next month) because Judy's mom has a lot of sway over Judy and Judy’s not sure if Judy could deny Judy's mom if it came down to it, especially since it could totally wreck their complex relationship.

Judy hasn’t really spoken to Judy's mom about how Judy feels yet- Judy knows Judy's mom is not going to take it well. In addition, the actual amount of settlement might not match up with what Judy's mom’s demanding and Judy's mom might be getting Judy's mom's hopes up. Judy loves Judy's mom and Judy’s afraid Judy's discomfort means Judy’s being selfish/greedy.

TL;DR

Judy's mom wants to buy a house “for Judy” (that Judy's mom will live in) with settlement money. the case is something Judy's mom said Judy's mom is doing for Judy, against Judy's uncle.

0,"AITA for Judy walking out of a dinner party with her boyfriend's family, because of something his Uncle said to her? | Judy went to a dinner party with her boyfriend's extended family last weekend. Judy had met a lot of the family already last year at Thanksgiving.

At the dinner, Judy was talking to her boyfriend's Aunt and Uncle about what Judy does (systems engineering for nuclear power plants) and then his Uncle said something pretty gross about how the guys there must like having a pretty young lady to look at.

Now Judy admits that hit a sore spot for her. Judy has had some crappy experiences with coworkers not respecting her because Judy is a young woman.

Judy firmly said to her boyfriend's Uncle ""Judy doesn't care for how you just spoke to her; Judy better not hear anything like that again"". Judy was trying to be firm but respectful; speaking to him in the same way Judy would speak to someone at work who said something Judy didn't appreciate. And he got kind of stubborn, saying he was just paying Judy a compliment. By this point, everyone was staring.

Judy was feeling pretty mad and Judy realized it would be a better call to walk away rather than escalate. So Judy said ""excuse Judy, Judy is going to take a walk before Judy says something Judy will regret."" And Judy went and grabbed Judy's shoes and purse and went for a walk.

Judy had already been having a really bad week before this, Judy's best friend moved out of town and Judy missed her a lot, Judy's apartment had been partially flooded by a plumbing issue, Judy was exhausted from the long drive the night before. And this thing, that should have been a little annoyance, was like the straw that broke the camel's back for Judy.

Judy started crying when Judy walked. Judy texted Judy's best friend to tell her Judy missed her. Her friend called Judy right away and could tell Judy was upset, and they talked for a while as Judy wandered. Talking to her friend made Judy feel a lot better, and after catching up for about 20 minutes, Judy noticed Judy's phone was dying, and Judy ought to have been getting back, so Judy said bye.

Judy's phone died right after they hung up, and Judy started making Judy's way back to her boyfriend's house. But Judy must have taken a wrong turn as Judy tried to backtrack Judy's steps; Judy was lost in suburban sprawl.

Judy saw the church steeple in the distance, and Judy realized that if Judy went to the church, the train station was close by. And Judy knew Judy's way to her boyfriend's family's house from the station. So Judy took that roundabout way back. By the time Judy got back, Judy had been out for about two hours.

Judy got back and her boyfriend was upset with Judy for being gone for so long, not answering calls, and generally for walking out rather than doing something less dramatic. Judy told him about Judy's phone dying, about getting lost, and he was still upset with Judy. Judy had made things very uncomfortable at the party when Judy was gone.

Judy apologized and said Judy had tried to walk off to deescalate things, and it wasn't Judy's intention to end up doing the exact opposite. But he was still upset with Judy for being a drama queen, which Judy doesn't think is fair.

We used to look after her a lot as they go on numerous vacations a year. We train her, she’s smart and picks up behaviours well. When she goes home it isn't carried on and when we have her again we work on it (waiting when we put her bowl down etc.), we also clean her water and food bowls as they’re often mouldy.

A few months back Alex asked if it would be okay for us to get a dog of our own, we look after theirs and they trust us. We live on farmland with lots of space. They said no as a dog may scratch our floor, the wife told Alex a week later she has not got enough time for her dog, she is trying to get a project off the ground and they worry if we got a dog it would bark, and set their dog off and that would impact her work. They shut the dog in a room of their house which makes her bark more than usual.

Shortly after they approached Alex when Alex's fiancé wasn’t home, they offered Alex their dog on a timeshare. Alex felt they were trying to take advantage of Alex as we’d expressed a wish for a dog of our own. They wanted us to have their dog when they're away and for Alex to walk her for them as then we get “the joy” of having a dog without responsibility. Their dog gets confused when she isn’t staying with us, as they yell at her when she tries to come and see us, we live open plan so when she is outside she is free to approach us. We really wanted a dog of our own and not to share someone else's, mainly as it does confuse her.

Alex got several messages after asking Alex at very short notice (an hour before) to have their dog, Alex had to say no as we weren’t home or were not available. Alex offered to bring their dog to wherever we were going but they were quite rude in their replies if Alex said Alex couldn't. We are now not allowed to pet their dog when she comes to our side of the fence.

They have asked if we would take their dog for a week as they have a lot of work, Alex declined. We could have her but Alex feels out of principle they shouldn't just get free dog-care from Alex when Alex is also working at home. Alex said it would not be any more beneficial for the dog, Alex suggested Alex could collect her and take her on an evening walk with Alex. They recently got chickens and it seems that this has further impacted the level of care for the dog, Alex thought this would be a good opportunity for them to tend to the chickens uninterrupted. Alex received a rude response telling Alex not to bother and basically a “thanks for not helping us”.

Ever since, they’re blanking us. Their dog came to see us today and the wife screamed at her and said “GET AWAY FROM THEM”, Alex said “oh don’t worry we are happy to say hello!” and the wife muttered under her breath 'only when it suits you'.

0,"AITA for telling Judy's mom to get a lawyer for her will so Judy's brother doesn’t screw Judy over for Judy's inheritance? | Judy's parents are not rich by any means but they made very smart investments in properties in India. They have about a million dollars invested in India and they’re currently in the process of selling everything over there and bringing it over to the U.S. now. They’re looking for real estate to invest in the U.S. 

Because of this, Judy's brother (22M) and Judy (16F) have a decent inheritance. Judy's mom made it clear that she wouldn’t just give them straight up money, but rather pay for undergrad and grad school if they needed it, their weddings, and also the down payment of their first house. All properties that they still have would be divided equally between Judy's brother and Judy. 

Now Judy's brother has taken upon himself to find these properties. He just searches real estate websites for properties and shows them to Judy's mom. He found one recently that Judy's parents liked and they were looking into investing. Now here’s the issue:

He argued that the property should go to him eventually because he was the one who found it. But he literally just searched on a real estate website for a couple hours and found it. Judy understands wanting a commission or something, but him getting the whole property just seems ridiculous to Judy. 

This was shocking to both Judy's mom and Judy because she’s made it abundantly clear that everything will be split 50-50 so him suddenly demanding the whole thing for a few hours work is appalling. 

It should also be made clear that Judy's brother has no idea what he wants to do. He’s switched career paths like probably 4 times in the last year, and the only thing he really cares about is traveling. So Judy thinks he’s just trying to land this property so he can travel and not have to worry about actually having a job since the income from the property would fund his traveling. 

He got really mad that she said this (admittedly, the way she reacted was not kindly) and refused to forward the details of the property. 

So Judy got really upset that he’s trying to take what they agreed was theirs, so Judy told her mom that she should get a lawyer to figure out her will and have it taken care of legally. At this point, she hadn’t because she thought it was clear that they knew what she wanted for them and that they would respect it. She agreed and said she would look into it after all this craziness dies down.

Judy's brother flipped out and said that they were making a big deal out of nothing and that there is no reason to spend all that money on legal fees. Judy's dad agreed especially since traditionally in India, property goes to the firstborn son and Judy would get all the gold and jewelry. 

As in typical Indian affairs, all of their family and family friends got involved and think Judy's mom and Judy are being ridiculous because getting lawyers for wills is unheard of and maybe even “disrespectful to Judy's elder brother”. 

That made Judy rethink whether Judy made the right choice, especially since Judy's parents are still young and so are Judy's brother and Judy. Maybe this won’t be an issue when they fully grow up.

0,"AITA for refusing to help Alex's mom on this project? | Over the past three weeks Alex's sister and Alex have been painting Alex's parent's house. Alex started in the dining room then moved to the large entryway/living room area which requires Alex and Alex's sister to work on scaffolding as the walls are so high. it's also a really awkward room with lots of ornate moulding. It's been a grueling few weeks and Alex's mom gets really angry whenever Alex and Alex's sister ask for a break. They've had 2 breaks in this time, and Alex's mom still brings it up as Alex and Alex's sister being lazy.

Alex started this project being really upfront with Alex's mom: Alex wanted to be able to fit in reasonable stopping points between projects. Aka Alex started this project ONLY and once Alex was done Alex wanted a break to focus on Alex's self for a few days before moving on to the next project. Alex doesn't mind doing these projects but Alex wants to spend time for Alex's self too.

Alex said that because Alex's mom likes to start projects then feverishly push people to finish them. Then Alex's mom starts another project in the middle of the first project, then another, so the cycle of work never really ends, and god forbid someone takes a break with something unfinished. It's also a really chaotic method of working. Alex prefers doing things orderly as it keeps Alex's own anxiety down.

Well, Alex's mom decided to start painting the kitchen (of course.) Alex's mom claimed it was just Alex's mom's own project and that Alex and Alex's sister don't have to help Alex's mom. Thing is Alex's mom can't do much because of Alex's mom's health, so Alex's mom constantly asks Alex and Alex's sister to stop what they're doing and help Alex's mom. Alex told Alex's mom over and over again that Alex wasn't willing to start on the kitchen until Alex finished the front room. Alex's mom seemed to relent with that at first.

This morning though Alex's mom came to Alex and said, ""hey can you ask your sister to help me tape around the cabinets?"" Alex was hesitant because Alex's sister is even less enthusiastic about these projects than Alex is.

Of course Alex's sister refused because it's just too much work right now, but Alex's mom flew off the handle. Alex's mom was calling Alex and Alex's sister lazy and ungreatful. Alex's mom was throwing insult after insult, and denying any of the work Alex and Alex's sister have done so far.

*""You only do these things because I'll scream at you if you don't!""*

Alex and Alex's mom had a similar fight before when Alex's mom and Alex disagreed on the exact method for painting the dining room (paint one half of the room, than the other. Moving the furnature in between)

Alex's oldest sibling who doesn't live there anymore was trying to give Alex advice about it and said, ""Treat this like an improv show. You always want to say *yes, but* but that's the same as saying *no*. Try saying *yes, and* instead.""

Alex just doesn't understand Alex's mom's logic though. While ""yes and"" can prevent a fight in the short term, it has been wrecking Alex's mental health trying to keep up with Alex's mom's demands. if Alex says ""yes and when would be a good time to start?"" Alex's mom will say ""right now"". If Alex asks for a break Alex gets chewed out unless Alex literally has a panic attack. If Alex doesn't put Alex's foot down about Alex's mom's parallel projects, then Alex will start having a mental break down.

0,"WIBTA for outing Judy's best friend as scammer and possibly messing up her livelihood? | First post here, please be kind.

Judy has known Judy's friend Joyce for over about 10 years. They met through a mutual friend and just clicked and became very close to a point of calling each other sisters.  Judy found out Joyce is a liar. It was always small white lies Judy didn't care about such as Joyce's age, things about Joyce's kids, past, etc. Judy noticed the stories Joyce told didn't make sense as Joyce's kids contradicted Joyce.

The scam: Joyce got into making reborn babies. Joyce made/sold them for couple of years and was doing well according to Joyce. Joyce claimed one of Joyce's daughters messed up Joyce's Etsy account and couldn't use etsy. Judy had an account with hundreds of ratings and offered to let Joyce use it to sell Joyce's reborn babies. Joyce took over Judy's etsy and started getting a lot of orders very fast as Christmas is only few months away. Despite getting large amount of orders, Judy noticed Joyce was not working on the dolls. Judy asked Joyce and Joyce said Joyce ordered the supplies. Joyce was also selling on Joyce's website.

Long story short, by early December, Joyce had over 70 Christmas dolls to make and send and Joyce had completed ONE. Judy helped Joyce organize the Christmas orders and made everything easier for Joyce.

Somehow all the dolls were out by Christmas in less than 10 days. The quality was severely lacking to say the least. Judy herself and Judy's DH, Joyce's husband and even Joyce's DIL helped Joyce for the last week. Judy was working with Joyce 18-20 hours a day and Judy's DH was helping make some parts Joyce never ordered.

After Christmas, Judy helped Joyce organize again fJoyce stopped sending out any orders after January. Some disputes were open due to quality of the dolls. And because Joyce made so much etsy required SSN or tax ID and Joyce used Joyce's business tax ID number so it's not tied to Judy at all.

Judy found out between the Christmas orders and ordered that were never sent, etsy refunded about $36k to buyers and is now owed to etsy. Few weeks ago, Judy found out Joyce was getting letters from the AG office and got curious and looked up Joyce's original website. Turns out Joyce had a lot of people on BBB complaining of never receiving orders. Judy checked BBB on other websites Joyce had and same thing. People were saying Joyce would deliberately tell them 90 days or 120 days to get them out and by then, the dispute timeframe was over on whatever platform they used to pay. Aside from etsy, Joyce scammed another $15k minimum and these are only the ones on BBB.

Joyce talked about a group on book of faces for scammers that is very active and large and Judy wants to out Joyce there. This was all 2017-2018 but Judy knows Joyce did some shady things last Christmas too, just Judy doesn't have as much info as Judy does for 2017. This may mess with Joyce's livelihood.  Joyce's husband makes enough to pay the bills but doesn't want to work. WIBTA if Judy joined scamming groups to out Joyce?

AITA for Escalating Against Friend Who Didn't Pay Nick
Nick's friend, call her Fay, worked a lowlevel corporate job for a huge company. Fay knew Nick was good at photography (casual) and had asked Nick to shoot for a corporate party before. It took a while to get paid but went well.

Fay asked if Nick wanted to shoot for a 2 day corporate event. Nick would receive $25 ph and another goodie bag, same rate. Nick said yes as the last event was fun. Nick asked Nick's boyfriend, call him Joe, to help. Joe and Nick would split the cash, be reimbursed for travel, and were each promised a goodie bag.

The event was awful. Joe and Nick worked 24 hours in 2 days. Joe and Nick were expected to have edited photos from the 1st day (ending 10pm) by the 2nd day (starting 6:30am). Joe left halfway through the 2nd day because the stress of the event set off a panic attack. Joe and Nick edited about a 1000 photos and sent them to Fay.

A couple months passed, Nick tried to contact Fay several times to hang out and ask about payment. Joe and Nick had spent $170 on Ubers, with Fay's approval. After a while, Nick called Fay out on ghosting Nick. Fay then told Nick a guy in accounting messed up, Fay didn't go through proper channels to hire Joe and Nick, that there was no money in the budget for Joe and Nick, and that Fay's boss told Fay to just not pay Joe and Nick.

Fay owned up that it was mostly Fay's fault not going through proper channels and wanted to pay Joe and Nick back herself. Nick decided that Fay should just pay Nick back for the Ubers, as they all were financially struggling. Nick thought it reasonable to compensate only money Joe and Nick lost.

Nick reached out to Fay several times after that, trying to set up payment. Fay always stated that Fay was struggling finanically but would keep Joe and Nick updated and would send Nick money. Nick agreed to give Fay time. Nick went back to Nick's home town with Joe for a long visit. Four months later, no word.

Yesterday, Nick sent to Fay's work email an invoice and letter of demand. Nick stated Fay had 2 months to pay Nick back for the Ubers and if any of Joe and Nick's photos were used, Nick wanted full compensation for hours worked ($700). If an agreement was not reached, Nick may escalate further (contact bosses, Fair Work, and possibly take it to small claims).

Fay was furious that Nick emailed Fay ""threatening to sue"" Fay and how Nick was a terrible friend for not considering Fay's financial crisis. Fay called Nick out on how the ramifications of this would hurt Fay more than it would hurt Nick (Fay could lose Fay's job vs. Nick could lose the money). Nick should be ""thankful"" for the opportunity Fay gave Nick to work with such a high profile company.

Fay works where min. wage is $18 ph, Nick knows Fay makes more. Nick works 3 jobs in Nick's home town to save money. Min. wage is $8. Fay constantly posts instas at bars/restaurants.

Judy (17F) is the eldest child, and so basically has been a live in nanny/ babysitter / parent no. 3 for Judy's siblings (15F and 12M) since Judy was 12/13.

Judy's Dad was (and is) really strict on Judy, especially in comparison to Judy's little brother. When Judy was Judy's brother's age, Judy was in bed at 9 pm EXACTLY every night. He technically has a 9 - 9.30 pm bedtime, and Judy's mum really tries to enforce it, but Judy's dad either completely forgets about it or tells Judy's mum to shut up when she asks him to get Judy's bro to bed, usually because he's busy watching TV or youtube with him.

Judy hates the way Judy's dad treats Judy's mum, and Judy hates how he is allowing Judy's little brother to become a spoilt brat, with absolutely no responsibilities or rules that he has to follow.

This anger has been building up for a while, and it was why Judy did what Judy did tonight. So, heres what happened.

Judy's mum asked Judy to go tell Judy's brother to get ready for bed at around 9, so Judy went downstairs to the office/guest bedroom/ tv room/ whatever to relay that message. Brother and dad are watching what looks like some horribly violent war thingy, loads of bomb sounds and gun noises etc, and Judy shouts over the tv to tell them that bro should get to bed soon. Dad says ok, they'll stop at the end of the scene, so Judy left them to it. Judy came back at 9.30, neither of them had moved, so Judy repeated the instructions, and got screamed at to leave the room because ""it was the most important bit!!!"". Judy was honestly just so sick of their crap so Judy just reached in and switched it off and walked away, because Judy's brother has to get to bed on time on a school night, and Judy had already given them half an hour's warning to pause the bloody thing.

They both went ballistic, started swearing at Judy, calling Judy a stupid cow, a bitch, and the likes, which is the kind of behaviour Judy can somewhat justify from a 12 year old, but not Judy's 55 year old father. Judy's dad followed Judy back upstairs, fully screaming at Judy, calling Judy abusive, obsessed with being in control, a psychopathic bitch, etc etc. Judy screamed back, calling him a child, and saying that Judy wouldnt have to do this kind of shit if he bothered to actually parent his child! He then accuses Judy of assault, supposedly for turning the tv off, which was interesting.

Judy's dad starts yelling at Judy's mum next, saying that it was Judy's mum's fault for making Judy relay her messages instead of coming down herself, which isn't fair bc Judy's mum was busy cooking dinner for tomorrow. By this time Judy's like fully sobbing, screaming at him to shut up and leave them alone, but he just keeps on yelling so Judy just ran to Judy's room in tears.

Judy feels kinda bad about turning the tv off, Judy'd probably be mad if it happened to Judy, but Judy feels like Judy's dad's reaction was completely unreasonable.

0,"AITA for not wanting to forgive Judy's brother for years of mistreatment? | Judy (18f) has an older brother (23m) and their relationship is extremely rocky. Judy's brother dropped out after about a year and a half of JuCo and didn’t tell anyone. Which, while Judy doesn’t judge him for dropping out, she has a big issue with him keeping it from everyone.

Judy has an issue because while Judy's brother was dropped out and lying, both Judy's parents had surgery. (Summer of 2019). So, most of the housework fell on Judy. The biggest one was taking care of Judy's other brother (20m) who has autism. All while Judy was starting her first semester at college (thankfully Judy still lived at home while at uni). It was a tough time. Since Judy's brother was lying about school, he would leave the house early in the morning (6am) and wouldn’t be back till late (9-10pm, when Judy's brother and parents are already asleep).

Judy was already frustrated with doing everything on her own, but at that point, Judy didn’t know he was lying. Judy was more upset that he wasn’t appreciative of Judy at all, and seemingly didn’t give a shit about Judy's parents, especially Judy's mom, who went through a very invasive and painful surgery. Judy's brother also was always around the house with an extremely bad attitude, snapping at Judy, barely even speaking to Judy and basically treating Judy like a nuisance, like he was a teenager again.

This treatment and pushing of responsibilities onto Judy is nothing new. Growing up, when Judy's parents left for a weekend, Judy's brother would “watch” Judy's brother and Judy, but he would completely ignore them or talk to them as if they were the most annoying people on the planet. Didn’t do wonders for Judy's self esteem and, once again, Judy took care of her other brother on her own. The treatment never left.

After Judy's brother finally came clean about dropping out, he also said he was struggling with depression and didn’t want to tell anyone, because “nobody would understand”. Judy was upset by this, since both Judy's parents have PTSD, and Judy's mother and Judy struggle with anxiety and depression. Judy's family has been through a lot and they’re very open. While Judy doesn’t fault him for being scared to talk about these things, Judy gets upset when he acts as though he is the only one struggling, and thus has an excuse to be rude and mean to them. Like he’s using his depression as an excuse to not help around the house and just be a mean person to them.

Recently, Judy's brother did something stupid and almost lost his girlfriend. Judy isn’t sure, but Judy guesses it flipped a switch in him and he’s been acting way nicer and doing nice things. Judy's brother actually talks to Judy's brother and Judy like people and is being honest.

Judy feels like it’s too late for them. Judy has never felt like he’s loved Judy as a sister and never treated Judy with respect. Judy doesn’t feel like she needs to forgive him. But then Judy feels guilty because Judy is sure his therapist is why he’s turning over a new leaf like this. Judy feels like if Judy doesn't open up, Judy will be stifling his growth. But it’s hard after years of mistreatment.

0,"AITA For disowning Nick's cousin (who's also Nick's wife's best friend) |

Nick's cousin decided to marry her boyfriend of 2 years (they were both 21 at the time.) Nick became good friends with him and continues to be today. He was deployed overseas after being married for almost a year (Army.) Fast-forward nearly another year. He returns from overseas to discover she wants a divorce and on top of that had been cheating on him while he was deployed. They get divorced and she moves in with her parents. A mere few months later she is pregnant by the guy she cheated with. He immediately ditches her and the baby, leaving her to raise it alone.

Nick's cousin and Nick are very different despite being close as kids. They didn't hang out much but Nick harbored no ill will until she cheated on her spouse who is a close friend to him. Nick was upset but gave her the benefit of the doubt. ""People make mistakes"" Nick thought.

Fast-forward 18 months. Cousin gives birth to the baby and is living with Nick's grandparents. They are getting on in years and they noticed their memories are not what they used to be (History of Alzheimer's in the family.) They decide to talk to their lawyer to check their affairs are in order because they are unsure how many years of being sound of mind they have left (Keep in mind right now they are still fine.)

Cousin takes grandparents to lawyer’s office. Cousin gets in her head (don't ask because Nick doesn't have an answer) that they are going to sign over to her sole power of attorney and management of their finances in preparation of them being unable to make such decisions in the future. The lawyer immediately shoots it down stating the following:

""That is premature as well as a poor choice of guardianship as the grandparents have two perfectly capable sons in their early 50's.""

Giving a 20-something single mom with no job and hardly any work experience that responsibility and power is a bad move.

She gets up on his desk screaming at him he has no right,etc. Lawyer asks her to cease at once or he will call the police. She doesn't. He gets on the phone to dial 911. She explodes out of the room and speeds off, leaving Nick's grandparents stranded. The lawyer apologizes and pays for Nick's grandparents to get a ride home.

His grandparents are the sweetest old folks you'd ever meet and she tried to take advantage of them before making a scene like that. Nick explained to his wife that he understands they are friends but he FORBID cousin to step foot in HIS house.

Since that day Nick has had no interest in seeing cousin. Wife still sees her now and again but less than before because she knows Nick has disowned cousin.

0,"AITA for refusing to split the cost of a housekeeper with Judy's boyfriend? | Judy's (27F) partner (35M) and Judy both have pretty different standards of living. They have lived together for several years so this is nothing new to them. 

To put it plainly, he would probably sit on camp furniture, eat off of paper plates, and sleep on an air mattress if it weren’t for Judy's presence. This doesn’t bother Judy. It’s the guy he is and Judy loves him for it. 

Judy on the other hand likes home making and making things “nice”. Judy has purchased all of their furniture and creature comforts. 

His tolerance threshold for mess is way, way higher than Judy's. Judy wouldn’t say he’s a slob but he doesn’t think to do some of the regular chores that need to get done: like vacuuming the baseboards, scrubbing the toilet and cleaning the base, washing the floor, and washing the sheets, cleaning the crumbs off the kitchen counter after you make a sandwich. Judy thinks these are pretty typical chores. On a more seasonal rotation Judy does deeper cleaning, like purging the pantry and deep cleaning the fridge, washing the windows and other textiles around the house, etc. 

Both of them have full time jobs, but he makes 4x what Judy makes. He happens to have a lot of hobbies and spends 100% of the weekend doing just that. He doesn’t make time, or find time, to do household chores so they end up in Judy's hands.

Judy has asked him several times to share responsibilities with Judy, but Judy usually gets accused of nagging or he holds it over Judy's head as a giant effort. Judy should also admit here that his efforts to clean don’t feel very sincere to Judy (ie: he will swipe the brush around the toilet bowl, but never lift the seat to wipe up the calcified urine build up, a critical task in cleaning the toilet in Judy's opinion). 

If he doesn’t accuse Judy of nagging, it’s that “Judy doesn’t think Judy's shit stinks”. Or, if Judy in any way points out the inequities in the time they spend looking after the house, Judy is accused of keeping score. 

Today Judy finally brought up asking him to pay for a housekeeper to come once a month. He insisted it was only fair if they split it. Judy totally disagrees. He makes 4x Judy's salary, and Judy cleans every week. The cost of a cleaner coming once a month would be $100 tops.

He totally thinks Judy is TA for asking for this. 

The alternative to him paying in order to share the responsibility Judy guesses would be Judy asking him to do chores. Which would lead to a tally and ultimately more resentment, so Judy doesn’t see that as a viable option. 

Judy thinks he’s being immature and that Judy isn’t asking for a lot. Part of living together is about respecting one another’s needs for living. Judy feels like Judy makes a lot of accommodations for his needs of living: their entire second bedroom is occupied by his hobbies. They have a whole garage with no cars in it that he uses as a workshop for more hobbies. 

They both have full time jobs. It’s not an affordability thing, they are DINKs with no debt and he makes 6-figures.

Nick runs a small operation where Nick guides groups or helps train them to be able to hike. Nick has served all kinds of clients.

Nick got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, Nick thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. Nick chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and they exchanged money and Nick started the training plan.

The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, Nick decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

When Nick arrived for their first group hike, Nick learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.

The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored Nick's list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When they got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset they were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc.

After they got back (6 hours later) Nick pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that Nick didn't believe them. When Nick suggested they aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. Nick gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at Nick incredulously.

2nd Hike went even worse. Nick had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to Nick this wasn't going to work. So Nick called the head and told her that Nick thought it was best if Nick refunded the cost pro-rated from the two hikes they did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called Nick all kinds of names, and insinuated that Nick is fatphobic, Nick's mocking them, etc.

Please, PLEASE keep in mind that Nick has helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send Nick pictures all the time of their great adventures. Nick considers himself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought they would start with something like a walk in a local park to get them ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations.

Nick refunded the money and ended contact only to find Nick's Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what Nick was called. Nick felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told Nick he was an asshole for not powering through, that Nick should have given them THREE chances, that Nick should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

Judy was a 24 year old woman, her dad was 65. Judy's fiancé passed away in April. Her dad was not there for Judy at all and was even drunk at the funeral. He saw Judy twice after and then ignored her and bailed on every attempt to hang out from Judy.

A few months later Judy started to finally make progress, getting her own place all on her own. Her dad ended up in hospital from mixing alcohol and pills.

Judy paid for almost the entire $5k deductible. Judy's brother and his wife reluctantly paid $1k cause Judy literally couldn’t have more money come out of her account at once.

Judy was there in the hospital after work every single day despite Judy's very, very unstable mom (they’re divorced but lived together) being there. When he was out Judy called out of work and drove 6 hours to get him to the rehab, falling asleep driving. Judy drove back. Judy had to go in and get his belongings while dealing with her mom who was aggressive, saying she’d call the police on Judy when she had no right to be there. Judy had to come back three times to get more of his stuff, the same things happened. Judy had multiple breakdowns in the car after seeing her.

Judy took care of all of his bills and broke his lease for him. He called every day to make sure Judy was on top of paying his stuff. It was an incredibly stressful two months taking care of herself and him when Judy was just able to take care of herself, but no one else was helping him.

He was out of rehab. Judy's brother wouldn’t let him stay with him in his 3 bedroom house. Judy said he could stay with her in her small 800 sqft condo for a couple weeks on the couch. It had been two months and Judy couldn’t have any friends or guys over after 11 (when he got off work) cause it was too weird. Judy thought her neighbors thought they were a couple and it was so fucking weird.

Judy stayed in her tiny room when he was there cause there was no real room in the living room. Judy was running out of money that she had saved up but spent on his deductible for rehab. He helped with a couple hundred for rent and said he couldn’t afford his own place. When Judy said he should find a roommate, he got offended. He said Judy just wanted him out of her hair and he did not want a roommate.

The only reason Judy would want him to stay was so he could save money to start paying Judy back and help with rent since Judy spent her savings on him, but it was so awkward and cramped and uncomfortable. He was recovered and was sober and it was good to have a dad and have him back to normal. But Judy felt she had done more than enough when he did nothing for Judy in the darkest time of her life. Was Judy the asshole for wanting him out, even though it would be financially smarter for both of them to live in that small condo together?

She does not work (she spent time in prison) and he makes mid/high 5-figures.

Nick's sister and Nick are in their late 20s. They both went to college and have not received money from them since they were 18 because of what happened, save for a few hundred here and there. They both have been very successfully professionally (think ~$150k).

A few years ago, Nick's sister and Nick received letters that they were named as two of the main beneficiaries on their mom's uncle's estate. When they received the notice, they shared it with their parents. They were honestly not close to their great uncle/communicated with him sparingly during holidays/birthdays. Their mother was very close with him growing up, and had continued contact with him. At the time of his death, he knew that Nick's mom was in trouble, but the full extent/amount was not yet figured out.

Nick's mother now claims that she told her uncle to leave everything to them so that they could help her out. Nick has no way to verify this and she initially acted surprised, but she has also taken a lie detector test that indicates that she did tell him to leave everything to them so that they could help her.

At the start, they were open with them about what was happening, but their parents' tone in conversations shifted over time, in their opinion, to indicate that they saw themselves more and more entitled to the money. They never came to an agreement on the extent that they would help them, because they were so far off (they gave them very broad assurances like ""we'll help when we can"" as the estate was being worked out, while they made it clear that they thought they were morally obligated to pay the debt outright if they could). By the time that it did close completely ~1 year ago, they already had had several blowup arguments. Their willingness right before the estate closed was probably to give them a monthly stipend but to ask them to sell most of their assets. After it closed, they had a few more VERY serious arguments. As it stands now, Nick has no immediate plans to help them at all or be in contact with them in any meaningful way (Nick can go into the reasoning for that specific thing in more detail if needed, but they've had some VERY bad arguments).

She’s probably one of the most manipulative people Nick’s ever met and has consistently made him feel horrible his whole life even though he’s done significantly more for her than she has for him. She has a daughter who Nick loves a lot. And he basically helped raise her since he was 11. But he can’t be a “mom” anymore. Nick's older sister just expects him to take care of her daughter and do every little thing for her. She’s taken advantage of Nick for so long. And he let her. She’s put Nick down a lot. For not wearing makeup. For being ten pounds heavier than she is. For not doing enough for her. For not making her food when she wants. For never being enough. For having feelings. But today she drew the line after getting in an argument with him and at one point Nick called her a bitch. She sent Nick oodles of essays via text. He apologized for calling her that and for what happened during the fight but then she continued to put him down and blame him for her problems. She kept telling him he wasn’t really “sorry.” Nick realizes he could’ve been better during the argument but she insisted she was the only one who was calm. She was not calm and yelled at him at one point and didn’t let him finish what he was saying. That was the point when Nick got up and went to his room.

Nick did stop talking to her at one point in his life to an extent, but decided to give her another chance to see if she would maybe listen to what he has to say or if she could try and understand that it’s never been easy being her brother. Or trying to talk to her. Talking to her is the most difficult thing Nick’s had to do because she doesn’t treat him like a sibling. He’s just someone she needs when it’s convenient or someone who is easy to manipulate.

Anytime they get into a disagreement or if Nick tells her she is doing something wrong she goes off on him and then the next day pretends it never happened and wants a “clean slate.” Nick prefers to talk through things so there isn’t tension or anxiety for him. Pretending things never happened is Nick's number one pet peeve and causes his anxiety to be worse.

Would it really be bad to cut her out of Nick's life other than formalities and interactions with his niece?

Nick's dad got involved with drugs and other illegal activities, and blew his parents' entire savings on who knows what. Nick's family had nothing. The last vacation Nick's family ever took, Nick's dad blew $8,000 in Mexico in a week. Suffice to say Nick does not trust his dad with money. Nick's dad has also been unemployed since Nick was about 13 or 14 and is on welfare. Nick's mum works at a daycare, but is currently on EI.

Nick got his first job at 12, as a paper delivery person, mainly so Nick could have some money to go to the mall with his friends. The law stated that because Nick was under 16, Nick's pay cheques had to be made out to his mum, and then she could transfer the money into Nick’s account. This would have been fine if it wasn’t for the fact that Nick's dad had access to her checking account, and would drain it on a weekly basis.

When Nick was 16, Nick's granddad took Nick to open his own bank account, at a different bank from his parents. Nick and his granddad told Nick's mum, but kept Nick's dad in the dark. Nick's dad found out when he stole cash from Nick's wallet and saw a new bank card. Since then Nick's dad would use threats of violence and emotional manipulation tactics to get Nick to give him Nick's money. Nick told his mum, but she never did anything. Nick was 16, what else was Nick supposed to do?

Nick has been consistently employed since then with several different jobs, and despite Nick's best efforts, Nick has never had more than a couple thousand dollars in the bank at a time. Nick has calculated how much his parents have taken from him since Nick started working, and it’s well over $10,000.

Nick's parents still regularly ask Nick for cash, and Nick keeps telling them no. When Nick does give them money for say groceries, at best Nick's parents get chips and ice cream. At worst, Nick's dad comes home with nothing, including the cash. Nick is tired of his hard earned money being wasted. Nick works three jobs and is in school full time.

Nick has told his parents if they need something, Nick will go buy healthy groceries for them, or go with them to the bank to make a direct payment for the internet, or something like that. But Nick will not give them cash or put money into their account. Nick's dad tells Nick Nick is being unreasonable, saying how family should help family, no questions asked, that Nick is taking away their right to independence and that by not giving them money Nick is leaving them with nothing for “just in case.” Nick's mum tells Nick that she understands Nick's frustration, but it would be easier on everyone if Nick just gave his dad the money.

Back in 2015 Nick's mother passed from cancer, leaving her home and her assets to ""A"" and him. Nick had graduated from university but “A” had never attended post-secondary. With no real work experience and a Bachelors degree that was practically useless Nick dropped his dream of law school and went back to school briefly while working whenever possible to ensure that bills were paid. “A” obtained part-time work. Nick transferred the all the bills into his name. Eventually, Nick graduated and obtained a full-time position with benefits and enough income to survive but not much else. ""A"" has a healthy bank account because his inheritance has barely been touched and while he's offered to transfer some bills into his name, no effort has really been made on either of their parts.

Around 2017 Nick's father came back into his life. They have a good relationship. Nick's father wants to see him go to law school but he would like ""A"" and Nick to keep their current house because housing market. Nick gets it but he’s not particularly attached to living in a house. The maintenance is another of his responsibilities. ""A"" does some household cleaning but nothing when it comes to repairing, doing extensive cleaning, or any other things that need to get done around the house. Further, ""A"" will never be able to afford to buy out Nick's half and Nick’s uninterested in the house.

It has been several years now since their mother passed and Nick feels he's done his part in giving “A” opportunities. Nick's put aside much of his life/interests for years. But life is hitting him hard.

In his spare time, Nick has been studying for the LSAT which he never wrote prior to 2019.

Their father wants Nick to attend part-time while continuing to work his full-time job. This would commit Nick to maintaining the house, the bills, working full-time, doing law school part-time and continuing to give ""A,"" who can't drive, rides to and from work as well as performing any chores requiring driving (groceries, etc.) and graduating later. Nick thinks it’s unrealistic.

Another of Nick's father's arguments is Nick will leave “A” high and dry if they sell the house and split the value 50/50 (roughly $350,000 each). Nick thinks it's perfectly fair as, (a) ""A"" is not his kid, (b) Nick's given ""A"" years to pursue something but he hasn't, and (c) Nick has to take his own interests into consideration. All of this has been discussed with “A” and Nick's father.

In addition, Nick's paternal grandmother is the Landlord of a small complex in the downtown core which his father runs and he and “M” live. “A” could also come with Nick.

Nick feels like the best choice for him is to commit and take law school full-time. Nick knows his father (possibly “A”) will never approve but he thinks he has to do what is best for him in this case.

Judy has told him multiple times that she does not earn enough to support two people and he needs to find a source of income, but nothing has changed. Judy's own bills are going into default and collections and she cannot afford health insurance because she has been paying for his things. Judy has no savings. Judy has no credit.

Judy is not sure if he blew it off, or if it really will happen soon.

The reason he is not working is he has a physical disability (he needs reconstructive surgery on one of his knees due to a car accident a few years ago) and several mental health diagnoses, including Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD.

The roommate said that because he drives a truck, a 50/50 split isn't beneficial for him but agreed to a driving one out of every three times. Nick agreed but stated that because Nick had already given the roommate numerous rides (they went out to lunch numerous times at work where Nick always was the one driving), that they should do 50/50 for October. The roommate agrees.

Yesterday, Nick stopped avoiding the roommate and they were leaving around the same time and the roommate recommends a carpool. Nick says yes, again expecting the roommate to drive but Nick again ends up driving. Last night, they were both planning to go to this new bar with a buddy and the roommate suggests a carpool again. Nick puts Nick's foot down and tells the roommate, only if the roommate's driving. The roommate insists on Nick driving because he doesn't know the place but Nick says neither does Nick.

Nick's brother died about two weeks ago.

Nick's parents are divorced and most of Nick's siblings don't really talk to Nick's dad because of some shitty things he did to Nick's mom and also because he was generally a bad parent. Nick was a senior in high school when they divorced so Nick didn't really get caught up in the custody battle, but Nick's little brother chose to live with Nick's mom full time as soon as he could (14 here). 

Fast forward to now, Nick's brother was in his early 20's and tragically died two weeks ago. Nick and his family held his memorial this week and due to current world conditions had to severely limit the size of the gathering. Additionally, because Nick's brother explicitly requested it, they had him cremated. Nick's mom and Nick covered the costs, and the memorial went as well as it could given world and family circumstances, in addition to the tragic nature of his death. 

Nick found out the day before the memorial that Nick's dad started a GoFundMe to cover the costs of the memorial, and today found out that he also started a donation checking account and is asking his side of the family, his church, his coworkers, and Nick's brother's coworkers to donate in order to help cover the costs of the memorial (which again, Nick's mom and Nick already paid for and Nick's dad said he could not afford to help with). 

This is a tragic time and Nick really doesn't want to start shit or cause contention, but honestly this makes Nick completely sick to his stomach because Nick's dad has already raised several thousand dollars (about 3x the actual costs) and Nick thinks he is trying to profit off Nick's brother's death. Additionally, the people who are generously donating are doing so under the assumption that their money goes toward helping with funeral costs, not directly into Nick's dad's pockets. 

Trying to see Nick's dad's side, Nick knows he is in bad shape financially as he does not make much money in general, has debt, and is laid off for the time being. Nick is sure he could use the money. Nick's dad is also grieving, and expressed a lot of regret about their childhoods at the memorial. He may be planning to spend the money on some sort of memorial object, but they already bought him a nice urn and gave him a portion of the ashes and there is no grave for a grave stone, so Nick is not sure what that would be. 

Nick still thinks his dad is acting completely unethically and potentially defrauding people. Would Nick be the asshole if Nick posted on social media asking his dad what he is raising money for and letting people know that the costs have already been covered and there is no need for donations? Instead, if people feel compelled to donate, they should donate to a charity or something.

About 6 weeks of no contact later, Judy's parents called her asking why Judy hadn't called to wish Judy's mum a happy birthday. Judy wanted to know if she was TA for not wanting anything to do with them given the way they cut her off. It later came out that the reason they cut Judy off is that Judy's older brothers told them Judy is a lesbian (which... Judy might be. Still figuring that out. But Judy's brothers didn't know that). Judy sent her parents proof Judy's brothers lied and they apologised but Judy's not forgiven them and probably won't ever. Judy had applied for emergency housing and a full student finance loan but as Judy couldn't prove her parents cut her off the services Judy had to go through said they couldn't help her. Judy was also looking into a work placement as her course offers them and they pay a decent amount.

So here's how everything has shaped up:

* Judy wouldn't be getting emergency housing from uni. Judy's not heard anything and there's less than a month left before summer, so Judy would be shocked if she got it at this stage.
* Judy is still living with her friend. The friend got Judy a job at her workplace but refuses to take any rent off Judy so Judy's been repaying her by sneakily buying food and cooking her dinner as Judy gets home before her. Judy and the friend have plans to move in together this summer ready for next year.
* Judy's parents have done a complete 180 and now want Judy to forgive them so badly that they're still refusing to sign a letter showing they've cut Judy off, so Judy is still fucked with student finance. Judy's parents have also offered Judy her truck back, so Judy, her roommate, and 2 more friends will be going to Judy's parents' house some time soon to collect Judy's truck and some things from Judy's room. Judy's tutor has written a letter for Judy for student finance which they might accept but Judy is waiting to hear back.
* Judy's course changes were approved so now Judy's doing what she wants, not what her parents want, and it looks like Judy got her work placement, so Judy will be either working and studying part time for 2 years or working all next year and finishing studies the year after. Either way Judy will be adding an extra year to her course but Judy gets paid and gets relevant experience in her field.

Ultimately, everything seems to have worked out as well as it could. Thanks to everyone who commented because a lot of you had great advice and thought of stuff Judy didn't, and Judy was truly concerned that she was in the wrong so thanks for the reassurance, too. Judy will also be booking a session with the on campus mental health professional because this has really shone a light on just how fucked up Judy's family is. Thanks again :)",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness,557
0,"AITA for Judy(20F) cutting off her aunt(27) over money? | Aunt(Kim) is getting married & everyone is saying Judy needs to apologize & attend her bachelorette(she didn’t invite Judy, MOH did) 
Story starts 2yrs ago. Place Judy worked had a holiday special for 40% off all merchandise. Judy's fam all gave Judy a list & said they’d pay Judy back when they see Judy. NP. Kim was the last to send her list & she sent it on the last day. Judy told Kim Judy would try Judy's best to get Kim everything but there’s people before Kim. Kim said to get Kim's stuff 1st. Judy replied 1st come 1st serve. Kim told Judy to skip Judy's lunch break & get Kim's stuff. If anyone has worked in retail during holidays, u kno how exhausting it is & all u want to do is sit down. None the less, Judy was able to get everything for everyone. They were fine getting their items when they had their Christmas party but Kim kept pestering about when Judy was coming over (Judy didn’t drive at this time. Kim did.) Kim’s notorious for shorting people of lose change & Judy's older sister warned Judy Kim would do the same. Judy just thought well If Kim does, Judy would let Kim know it’s rude, & a normal person would realize that & apologize. Find out Judy and Kim would both be going to Judy's lil sisters game & Kim kept texting Judy to bring Kim's items. Judy gave Kim the total ($111.74). Judy gave Kim Kim's stuff & Kim said she FORGOT to bring money, she’d owe Judy, remind Kim when Judy came over for Christmas. Dude really? U reminded Judy everyday & u FORGOT? & Judy has to remind u when to pay Judy back for a FAVOR Judy did for u? Forward to Christmas Kim says she doesn’t have cash rn. Judy had to remind Kim for weeks until Kim saw Judy's older sister & gave Judy's older sister just $111. At this point Judy was irritated but texted Kim in a joking way & said “hey dude, ur total was $111.74 lol” Kim says“And? Do u want the 74 cents or something? Lol” “Idc about the 74 cents. But its the principle of the matter. It’s rude. Plain & simple.” Kim said “We’re family. I didn’t think you’d care about money like that lmao” Judy and Kim went back & forth & the whole time Kim was being condescending, saying “do u want ur 74 cents or something? U need 74 cents?” Judy got mad & said “Don’t ever talk to me again. Bye” Kim replied “ok, that hurt” & Judy and Kim haven’t spoke since. Few weeks later Judy's cousins got Judy in a room & told Judy Kim told them what happened & Judy needs to apologize or Judy's no longer invited to family vacays. Judy said if Kim wants to tell Judy something, tell Judy. Don’t get other people to do it for Kim. So AITA? What should Judy do? Judy's seriously tired of the high & mighty attitude Kim has towards the younger kids. The lesson wouldn’t be learned if Judy talked to Kim again. Does Judy think 74 cents is worth cutting Kim off? Of course not. But Judy refuses to be stepped all over & brainwashed like Judy's cousins. Judy thinks Kim owes Judy an apology.",False,False,2,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness,557
0,"AITA for setting boundaries with Judy's boyfriend’s family? | Judy (27F) has been with her boyfriend Josh (29M) for 2.5 years. Judy spends ~3 nights/week at his place, and they’re planning for Judy to officially move in in the next 6 months. The crux of the problem is, Josh lives in an apartment that his parents bought for him and his younger brother. His brother, Sam, doesn’t live in the same city anymore, so Josh pays his parents slightly below-market rent for the entire place. Since deciding that Judy should move in, they’ve been trying to get Sam to pick up his stuff from back when they lived together.

The thing is, even though Josh pays rent for the apartment, his parents still see it as “their place,” and his mom in particular will come unannounced and stay for long periods. Most recently, she came to the US for 7 months, alternating between staying with Josh or Sam. There was no end date set when she arrived, and she only left because of immigration requirements. She doesn’t approve of Judy living with Josh, is cold and snarky to Judy, and is also quite picky about her living environment, so Judy stays over less when she visits. She also expects Josh to spend every free moment with her, so they rarely get alone time when she’s here.

As she was leaving at the end of the 7 months, she mentioned she was planning on being back right after New Years! Judy doesn’t think Judy did a great job of containing Judy's shock, and honestly the knowledge that she’d be back so soon was Judy's breaking point. That night, Josh and Judy had a long discussion about setting boundaries with his mother. Judy told Josh that her behavior is making Judy reconsider their relationship, especially as their relationship gets more serious (Judy shudders to imagine what she’d be like with future kids).

So Josh talked to his mom, and the phone call was apparently a shit show. The highlights are:
- Josh told his mom that, for future visits, she needs to give them set dates in advance. No more unannounced, indefinite stays. His mom responded that it’s her place and she can stay there when she likes. Josh then said that, if that’s the case, they’ll find a new place to move into together. His mom was also offended by this suggestion.
- His mom was angry that they asked Sam to pick up his stuff. In her opinion, they bought the apartment for Josh and Sam, so Sam has a rightful claim over part of it, and they can’t ask him to move his stuff or get rid of it if he refuses.
- She also expressed concern that, if Josh and Judy eventually marry, Judy will treat her poorly. She was offended at Judy's reaction when she told them when she’d be back, and called Judy manipulative for saying Judy was reconsidering their relationship because of her.

Judy was having dinner with Judy's college roommate and her family, who are from the same country as Judy's boyfriend, and they think Judy's boyfriend’s mom is not the asshole. Some even think Judy is being an asshole and should be more receptive to her visits and make more of an effort to endear Judy to her.

0,"WIBTA if Nick left his job of 7 years over a coworker's unaddressed behaviour | Sorry - it's a long one.  

TL;DR: Nick’s coworker is driving him nuts. She's slow, throws tantrums, lies, and won't listen to him (manager). Boss won't do anything and Nick has a new job offer. WIBTA if Nick left (with appropriate notice), and told his boss that she's the main reason he quit?  

Long version:  

About 4 years ago they hired Joan. Joan and Nick went to the same school, and took the exact same program with the same teachers.  

At first, she was a bit forgetful or asked basic questions, but there's always a learning curve starting a new job. After a year she continued to mess up. Customers would get angry or flat out say they were not coming back because of things she did.  

Now, Nick gives her advice or instructions and she will give him 101 reasons why she wants to do it her way. Nick tries to help her with problems she's having, using advice that she normally would have done herself, but she will reject his idea, seemingly because Nick was the one who said it.  

Recently, she's had tantrums, screaming matches with the boss and Nick, and will cry and storm off over really small disagreements. She NEVER apologises for her behaviour. The one time Nick pushed for an apology she literally got on her knees and mocked Nick (""PLEeEeASE forgive me, deadleaf28!"")  

Last week, they made a plan that Nick would continue hole punching some books while she printed her business cards, and when there was a decent amount to coil, she would start coiling. Nick guessed she forgot? Because when Nick reminded her about it, she blew a gasket. Convo below:  

Nick: Hey, I'll take over the punching now, you can go do your cards.  
J: No I'm fine.  
Nick: But.. I thought I was going to punch and you do your cards?  
J: FINE! I'LL DO THE DAMN CARDS! I WILL DO THEM! I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP YOU!! *runs away*  
Nick: What?  

Nick met her at her desk and she was really angry and crying. (No actual tears...)  

Nick: What's wrong, why are you crying? I thought that was the plan, for me to punch and you do cards, then coil??  
J: IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THE STUPID CARDS I'LL DO THEM!  

Boss shows up to see what all the fuss is about. Joan IMMEDIATELY calms down, stops 'crying' and says, ""oh, I misunderstood.""  

Nick feels like Joan is trying to manipulate him into either quitting or losing his cool. The only time Nick has raised his voice at her was when she was already yelling at him so he could make his point before she ran away. Nick has told his boss about his concerns and how he really can't work like this anymore. She says she'll hire somebody new but it's been over a year and she's done a few interviews and hasn't hired anybody, and hasn't told Joan that it's not acceptable behaviour. Recently Nick got a job offer in the same field, with better pay and a better organization.

0,"AITA for quitting and walking out of Judy's camp counselor job last summer? | Judy is 17f and she had a job as a camp counselor last summer. It was horrible.

The pay was hourly but they all worked way more hours than they are allowed to report on their time sheets. Minors are only allowed to work 48 hours a week but there is really no time off at camp. The day starts at 7 am and ends at 10 pm. Not to mention if kids wake up in the middle of the night, or pee their beds, then more time. So 15 hour workdays, 7 days a week. 105 hours a week. They're only allowed to report 48 a week, which means only getting paid for 48 a week.

There is no cell service or access to landlines for them, no internet access, no transportation except cars on or off the camp which is deep in the woods. None of the 16 or 17 year olds had cars. Judy feels like more people would quit on the spot if they had a way to leave.

So, onto the drama. Two months into the summer, the camp was having a staffing problem. They'd fired one guy. That guy's three best friends quit on the spot with him. Two international counselors quit soon after.

Judy was working at the arts and crafts shed, along with Tom who's 17. They're good friends and Judy kinda has a crush on him.

One of the girls in their group was the camp owner's daughter, who is really really spoiled, she's used to getting everything she wants if she says ""but Susan's my mom!""

She wanted more craft supplies, and Judy said no, every child only gets three because they need enough for everyone. She started a screaming crying fit going ""But I want them! My mom's Susan, you have to give me them! you have to!"" It was silly but it was Judy's last straw, and Judy was like ""Actually I don't have to do anything."" She goes ""Yes you have to, Susan's your boss""

And Judy goes ""Not anymore."" Judy went to leave and Tom followed her, he said he was done here too. They ran into another counselor with a radio on the path and said they should radio the office to send someone else to the crafts shed, they were quitting.

They packed their duffles and walked away, it took them almost four hours to walk the dirt road out of camp and to the nearest small town, where they went into the dollar store and asked to use a phone because they had no cell reception. Tom's parents were only two hours away so they came to get them that night.

Things apparently got crazy behind them. The counselor they'd told about quitting didn't know who they were so nobody knew who had quit for a while. The camp director was furious at them for having left the children alone, but also furious that they, two minors, had walked off with no ride and no communication with parents. Judy guesses they were in a weird place where they were employed and responsible for children while also legally being children the camp was responsible for...

0,"AITA for refusing to order Nick's cousin's kids vegan food when he was at his grandma's? Nick is 34 years old and has a 6 year old son. His son loves to visit his great grandma so Nick took him to visit. 

Nick isn't vegan, his son isn't vegan, and nor is his grandma. However, Nick's cousin who had dropped her kids off at his grandma's IS vegan, and so are her 3 kids, 13,12, and 5. 

Nick's cousin usually drops her kids off at Nick's grandma's place so she can go to yoga, and normally (Nick thinks from what his grandma has mentioned) she’ll leave cash so his grandma can order them some vegan food. However today she didn’t leave any money because Nick assumes she saw him there and figured he’d take care of the bill. She’s always done stuff like that since they were young, because Nick has always been a saver and she’s never missed trying to take advantage of that. 

After maybe 2 hours, Nick decides it’s time for lunch and so asks his grandma if she’s hungry cuz he’s happy to cook. She insisted he leave the cooking and order in but he’s not letting an old lady cook or waste money when there’s food in the house so he makes some awesome vegan tacos (it was vegan ground beef on lettuce leaves with diced onion and sriracha mayo so really nothing fancy but pretty tasty). 

Nick's kid ate it yelling ‘daddy this is AWESOME’, his grandma ate it and was pleasantly surprised that it was good, Nick ate it and even the dog was sniffing around at the ground meat. Two of her kids however sat there with their noses turned right the way up and kept saying ‘ew, I just want to order something in’ whilst the youngest chomped it down shaking his butt doing the little kid happy food dance. 

Nick just told the older two they could eat this or go get fruit from the kitchen. They sat there scowling until their mom came back. When she did they went running to her and told her how hungry they were, at which point she asked why he hadn’t ordered them food when ‘there’s just literally a vegan sushi bar a block away’. Nick told his cousin that he had cooked vegan food, and he didn’t feel the need to order in when there was already food available. 

She called him a complete asshole (in front of his son as he had wandered in by this point) and told him that if he was such a tightwad she would have squared the cash with him right from the start so her kids didn’t need to go hungry. Nick was beyond fuming but kept calm for the sake of his son, and instead just went out in the backyard so he could focus on his boy. 

After she left and Nick came back inside, his grandma was very quiet and asked him to please apologize to his cousin. Nick told her he’d reach out to his cousin to talk it over at some point but he wouldn’t be saying sorry, but he’s just so irritated over the whole thing he’s not sure if he’s letting his emotions cloud his judgement here.",False,False,4,5,2,1,1,3,Fairness,548
0,"Was Judy the asshole for refusing to do Thanksgiving with her boyfriend’s family every other year, even though Judy previously agreed to? Judy is generally all about sticking to your word, but this one has Judy in a corner. Early on in their relationship, Judy and her boyfriend agreed that since they wanted to spend holidays together, they’d alternate each year between his parents and her parents for Thanksgiving. Both of their sets of parents live within 30 min of them. The first couple years, it went well. Then, out of the blue, his parents told them one year that they would be going to have dinner with their extended family. Cool. Except his extended family lives a 5 hour drive away and they want them all to drive up there and back together. And they would be staying all weekend, Thurs-Sun.

It was a lot, but it was his year so Judy agreed. It was mostly great, but his extended family lives in the boonies with no internet access or cell reception. Judy got back Sunday night to a bunch of angry emails from her boss. Judy works in a demanding field where the expectation is you pretty much be available 24/7 unless you tell people (and even then it’s frowned upon). Judy explained that Judy hadn’t realized Judy wouldn’t have any access, accepted the reprimand, and moved on.

The problem is, for some reason, his parents now insist on doing this every year. According to Judy's boyfriend they have always hosted thanksgiving at their house, but now they’ve decided his extended family will host every year.   So every other year, Judy is expected to take the car ride over with the family and spend the whole weekend there. Judy has done it twice and it’s always pretty inconvenient.

It’s his year again, but Judy has found out that Judy has been invited to go to a work conference shortly after thanksgiving this year. Because of prep, timing, and travel arrangements, Judy will need to fly out the night after thanksgiving. Judy told her boyfriend and offered to still come up there, but leave early by herself. He got upset. Apparently his family will find this incredibly rude.

This led to a fight where Judy finally said that Judy doesn’t want to go to his extended family every other year. He argued that Judy had agreed to it and it was only fair, but Judy feels that this is way more than Judy agreed to and is unreasonable. They spend half a day with her family on her years and only have to travel an hour round trip. They spend 4 days with his family and travel 10 hours round trip to somewhere that’s so isolated, Judy can’t even respond to a work emergency, which makes Judy look bad.

Judy told him Judy wasn’t willing to do it anymore if his parents insist on going to extended family’s. At most, Judy would be willing to do it every third year, and do the other two years with her family. He thinks this is incredibly unfair, since Judy previously agreed to split evenly and since it means his parents have to either choose to host every other year (and not go see extended family) or only see him on Thanksgiving every third year.

0,"AITA for thinking Judy's job prospects are a priority in Judy's marriage? | So a bit of background. Judy is female, married, and a vet. went back school using Judy's education benefits/student loans and Judy is almost done with Judy's Master's. Judy's husband makes $10 working full time as a temp in a factory. They've been together for a decade and married for about four years. He knew that there was a strong likelihood that they would have to move after Judy's degree program. Now that they're approaching that point, apparently Judy is now restricted from going certain places because they have to be in a state that isn't too restrictive on guns, because that would be taking away his freedom. That leaves Judy with pretty much the deep South, the rustbelt, and a scattered array of other states where Judy is probably not gonna be able to make a living. Most of the jobs that pay a living wage in Judy's field are in big metro areas, VA, DC, and so on. Again, this was discussed. Judy also brought up the possibility of moving abroad, but apparently that made him super angry because he stormed off and accused Judy of being inconsiderate.

Judy loves Judy's guns too. Don't get Judy wrong. Judy doesn't particularly want to go where Judy can't have them, or is restricted from having certain things that Judy can have right now. It's not like Judy is trying to move somewhere where they can't have them. The bottom line is, Judy has student loans to pay... and honestly, most of that went to keeping them afloat while he was in between jobs for a year (Judy found him the job he has now... Judy was going broke paying his half of the bills while going to school, and Judy couldn't take any more hours at work without failing because of Judy's schedule), and that was on top of him need health insurance (Judy has the VA... Judy didn't need it. Judy is basically having to pay for both of them to have insurance so he can even qualify for it). Judy would like to at least pay off those student loans so they don't have to spend their lives in poverty. Judy is not asking him to do it. Judy is not even asking for help. Judy is asking to be able to get a job that allows Judy to do so. It would be one thing if he had a degree, or knew a trade, or something... Anything, really... But he doesn't. He hates his job, doesn't want to go to school. He has no aspirations to do anything at all that actually involves any more planning than what he's doing now.

Judy just feels like Judy has been extremely forgiving and honestly very flexible about this. Judy has asked him to find somewhere he would like to go. Judy has asked him for suggestions.

0,"WIBTA if Judy told her SO to cut back on complaining about being bald? (31F, 31M) | Together 2 yrs. He went bald in his teens, completely bald by age 19 or 20. No medical condition, just very early onset male pattern baldness. Judy is hugely sympathetic – your hair is a big part of how you look, and she can’t imagine how hard that’d be as a teen. Not diminishing the importance or what a big deal that is to guys, especially so young. She gets it.

He is going to interview for medical residency soon and all he can talk about is how no one is going to hire him because he’s bald. He’s 6’2”, slim and athletic (swimmer/runner body), Caucasian, very handsome and symmetrical face, perfect teeth. Some people don’t like the bald look, but everything else is conventionally perfect. And he’s very sociable, intelligent, great with kids (looking for pediatric-related residency, so that’s relevant), has good grades, etc.

He goes on and on about how being bald is going to hold him back, nobody’s going to hire him, he should’ve gone to school for a job where you don’t interact with the public so employers might still hire him and just keep him in the background where nobody has to see him. In short, he’s being ridiculous, but he actually says this stuff very seriously, every single day.

Judy, on the other hand, is a very petite (4’11”, 95 lb), very young-looking (Judy was carded for an R-rated movie last year), dark-skinned black woman, also a doctor. She started a little younger than he did, so she’s almost done with her surgery-related residency. It’s a constant struggle for her to be taken seriously as a surgeon. Judy is ALWAYS confused for a secretary or medical assistant (at best, a nurse) even when she’s in her surgical scrubs. This includes patients, staff, and other doctors. Patients don’t trust her advice, staff don’t take her instructions as seriously, colleagues aren’t always welcoming. That’s its own story, suffices to say Judy has a hard time and probably always will.

Judy just deals with it (what choice does she have?) but it’s really bothering her lately how much her SO whines about being bald when he otherwise has THE most stereotypical “doctor look” ever. Judy honestly wants to tell him that she’s not the right person to complain to about that, considering how much harder she objectively has it, and that he needs to grow up. It just makes her roll her eyes being a dark-skinned black woman who looks like a third-grader, comforting this tall, thin, athletic, handsome white man about how he’s such a poor victim of genetics and will never be accepted into medicine because he has no hair, and reassuring him that he isn’t too “weird looking” to get a residency. Get a grip.

WIBTA if Judy told him how tone-deaf he’s being and to stop complaining to her about it? Again, she knows going bald is a big deal.

0,"AITA for refusing to claim Nick's grandma? | Some backstory: Nick's grandmother and Nick never had a very good relationship. Nick's cousins and Nick have a running ""joke"" that Grandma loved you... Until you turned 13. Then she absolutely hated you until you proved yourself. Nick's oldest cousin got married to a wonderful guy. Nick's middle cousin gave Grandma her first great grandbaby. When Nick started going to college, Grandma started liking Nick again, but that seemed to end quickly when she found out Nick medically withdrew.

Because Nick never ""earned Grandma's love,"" she always was really petty and nasty towards Nick, especially around the holidays. Most notable was the Christmas Nick's brother was born. Nick's parents were still in the hospital on Christmas Eve, so Nick was alone with his grandparents. Nick's grandmother screamed at Nick that Nick was an ungrateful child, Nick's parents gave Nick everything and Nick squandered it, and Nick was horribly disrespectful and didn't deserve what they gave Nick. Nick didn't tell his parents for years. It got worse, but Nick always took it because Nick's brother loved having the family together for Christmas.

Three Christmases ago, Grandma started acting nasty towards Nick's little brother. Even to the point that she made him cry on his birthday because she accidentally caused him to spill his milkshake but ended up screaming at him that he was acting ridiculous and that it was all his fault and he didn't deserve the milkshake in the first place. That's when Nick's hatred really began to fester.

Two Christmases ago, Nick was late to Christmas because of work. Before Nick got there, Nick's grandma kept needling Nick's dad over petty shit and Nick's dad got mad, which turned into an argument that Nick's dad ended with, ""This is my house and you need to respect that.""

Nick showed up early Christmas morning to find Nick's parents standing in the kitchen. Grandma left in the middle of the night to check into a hotel and left a note to Nick's little brother blaming Nick's dad for acting immature and attacking her.

Grandpa was gone to check on her. Nick's grandpa came back and went to talk to Nick's parents privately. Nick's mom told Nick that Grandpa was sent to tell Nick's dad that Grandma refused to come back for Christmas unless Nick's dad apologized for unjustifiably attacking her and acknowledged that Nick's dad was ruining Christmas. If Nick's dad refused, then Grandpa was to pack up their things and leave. Nick's grandma also demanded Nick's grandpa take Nick's uncle's ashes from off their mantel because they ""don't deserve to have him in [their] house anymore."" (Nick was very close to Nick's uncle before he passed.)

Since then, Grandma keeps sending gifts to Nick's little brother, saying she is innocent and it's all Nick's dad's fault. Nick's parents haven't let Nick's brother see any of it (too hard to explain). Grandma has made no attempt to contact Nick.

Nick's oldest cousin told Nick that Nick was overreacting and Nick ""just needs to get over it."" Nick's friends have looked at Nick shocked when Nick says that it would be easier if she was dead, because that's a better explanation than what's gone on.

1,"AITA for intentionally making a meal Nick's friend is allergic to? | At 17 Judy studied abroad and was immediately labeled as the ""rich foreign student"" within Judy's university (because of Judy's country's currency things were cheap).
Judy quickly made friends and started dating one of the locals. He and Judy had their own set of friends but they'd all hangout together.
At the time Judy started getting close to someone Judy saw as a sister, let's call her Emy. She lives in the uni hostels and Judy rented a studio apt next to uni but because they spent all their time together she just moved in with Judy. She paid for nothing (no rent, bills, expenses) Judy didn't mind because it wasn't a big deal. As Judy said things were cheap.
Judy's boyfriend, his friends and Judy's friends would hangout at Judy's place most of the time. One specific friend they'll call Jack started a thing with Emy which led to her having feelings for him.
Emy was in a different faculty and had her own schedule so she couldn't spend time with them most of the time. Because of how often they came Judy started to get to know the type of person Jack is. In summary he's a playboy.
Judy tried warning Emy about Jack and she said that Judy was overreacting and that it's fine for him to see other people because ""they're not official yet"", but she was very protective of him.
Whenever they'd go out (without Emy) there's always a new girl with Jack and every time Judy was the one paying for everything. For the first few times Judy was trying to be nice but then it became a habit. Judy always ended up paying for 4 people (Judy, Judy's boyfriend, Jack and any new girl he'd bring) and if they invited more friends Judy paid for them too. This took a toll on Judy's finances where Judy couldn't afford necessities.
On top of that Jack started a habit of coming to Judy's place just to have meals and meet his girls/hook ups. Judy never said anything about it because he Judy's boyfriend's friend.
Until Judy went broke at the end of the month and had to live off whatever scraps Judy had in Judy's fridge. Judy knew Judy's boyfriend was coming over with Jack which means he'd try to eat whatever Judy had left so when cooking Judy added some things Judy knew he was allergic to. Emy saw Judy adding weird things to Judy's food and asked what Judy was doing so Judy said that Judy knew Jack was allergic and didn't want him to eat anything Judy was making.
(It's not like Judy was gonna make him eat it, he usually asks if he can have some and saying no was always an issue to Judy so Judy said ""Oh no Judy added *whatever he's allergic to*. Judy didn't know you were coming and that's the way Judy likes to make this meal, sorry"")
Emy. Freaked. Out.
She said Judy was petty, disgusting, cheap, for not letting him eat at Judy's place. ""Food is food"" and that Judy's ""trash for what Judy did."" She never took in consideration what Judy was going through financially because of these people, including her.
She ended up moving out right after and stopped talking to Judy and made everyone within their friend group hate Judy for what Judy did and other things like ""Judy's spending time with Jack because Judy wants him to herself"" even though the only reason Judy tolerated him was for Judy's boyfriend.

1,"AITA for getting upset over a false paternity test | Nick and his wife have been married for 10 years. They met in college, and she has been his best friend for almost 14 years now. She is beautiful, supportive, kind, classy, and all around amazing as a wife.  

They went through a really rough patch about a year ago, mostly due to issues on his end. However, she told him she was pregnant. Nick was overjoyed. She told him she would only keep it if he was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, he said he was fully committed, and they kept the baby.  

As time went on, Nick became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was his. He did the math and thought it was unlikely it was his, on top of having a gut feeling. He was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, he could barely even hold him because he was so convinced he wasn't his.  

Nick told his wife he wanted a paternity test. She was upset but told him to get one if it would ease his mind. The test comes back two weeks later and it says he is not the father.  

Nick is absolutely livid. He had an out of body experience. He stormed into their house and just let loose. He felt like he couldn't stop himself, he was completely broken in that moment. He cried and screamed and asked her what he did to deserve this. He absolutely never laid a hand on her.  

The whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. This made Nick even angrier for some reason, so he kicked her out right then and there. He told her to pack her bags and just get out.  

She calls him the next day and tells him that he deserves to know that the baby is his, and asks him to get a paternity test from another company. Nick figures he has nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help him in a divorce, so they get one at the company she suggested, and he sent a third to another company, just to be sure.  

Nick gets the results from one and they say he is the baby's father. He waits a few days and doesn't say anything, then gets the second set of results, also confirming he's the father. He feels like the weight of the world has just been lifted off his shoulders and he can finally be the dad he wants to be.  

Nick calls his wife to give her the good news and she tells him she's not moving back in. She says she's disgusted with how he acted by asking for a paternity test and his reaction to the false one. She tells him he can come see his son, but she will be filing for divorce.  

Nick doesn't think his reaction was over the top for a man who thought he was being lied to about one of the most important things. He never showed any sort of violence and he was so emotionally broken at that point. He knows how it must have looked to her, knowing that he was the father, but he doesn't think she's seeing it from his perspective. He's planning on discussing it with her later and trying to convince her to work on it with him when he goes to see his son.

1,"AITA for locking Nick's girlfriend in a room until she applied for a new job? | Nick \[24M\] lives with his girlfriend \[25F\] who hates her job in advertising. She often comes home and starts crying because of how abusive they are to her. Nick has met her boss and he is honestly kind of twisted. He knows that she will get deported if he fires her, so he dangles her job over her head because he knows it will make her work overtime. He underpays her and tells his whole office that anyone who discusses salary will be fired. One glance at glassdoor and it's obvious she's underpaid for her role.

She is a very talented individual who went to a top 3 school in China, and then got her masters in states at a prestigious program in the US. She works super hard and all her coworkers that Nick has met tell him she's a superstar. She has been promoted multiple times but without a substantial salary increase.

Nick knows she can get a better job at a better company that treats her well if she tries, and she **talks** about applying for a new job all the time. But inertia is incredibly powerful, especially if you're already exhausted from working from 8am - 11pm every day. They have had a lot of discussions where Nick tries to talk her into actually setting aside some time to network and apply at other places, but she never gets around to it. For context it has been **1.5 years** since she started complaining about her job and she hadn't even applied to other places. In fact they talked about it briefly on their first date.

Her boss is intelligent & manipulative. He will occasionally throw her a bone, like give her a tiny raise, or compliment her work, that makes her feel like ""maybe things will get better"" - but they don't, and she's always in tears about it a few days later. She also has some sort of internal confidence issue, combined with inertia, combined with not having the energy / motivation to do it.

Nick didn't know what to do - it's not like Nick can apply for her. But it was breaking Nick's heart to see her like this. So one day Nick asked her to cover her eyes because he had a surprise for her. Nick led her into the bedroom where he had put her laptop and then shut the door behind her, and held it shut. Nick told her through the doors that he would not be letting her out until she showed him a few submitted applications. Nick even left some water and food in the room.

She whined a bit at first and asked Nick to let her out but Nick refused. It felt cruel but necessary to finally give her a push. Honestly Nick has done a lot of talking with her, and Nick feels talking is just that - talk. She eventually caved and started editing her resume and writing the cover letter. After 2.5 hours she had sent a few applications out and Nick let her out, and they hugged it out.

1,"AITA for not punishing Nick's daughter for standing up to her cousin? | Hi all. 

Nick's sister Eleanor and her husband Paul were staying over at Nick's place for Nick's much younger brother's wedding over the weekend.

Eleanor and Nick have daughters who are both 15. Nick's daughter is called Sarah and Eleanor's is Becky. They are both very pretty but are polar opposites in terms of personality. Becky is very confident, outgoing, has loads of friends and is a huge party girl. She's also very capable academically and according to Eleanor is top or near the top of most of her classes. Sarah is the opposite. She is a kind and gentle person but is sensitive and at times awkward, with major issues with her confidence. She has a few very close friends rather than being part of a large group. Her academic performance is decent but not exceptional like Becky, but Nick and his wife are nevertheless proud of her because they know Sarah works hard at school. 

Becky bullies Sarah and has done for a long time. She is spoiled by her parents who think that it's ''just harmless kid stuff''. Just this weekend she told Sarah that she was too ugly to go the wedding and that she would have to stay out of the photos. She also tried to push her out of big family photo at the reception. Nick's wife Diane had to find Sarah after Sarah ran outside crying. This bullying has gone on for years and nobody has made an attempt to stop it. 

Sunday morning in the garden Nick and others heard someone scream inside the house. Nick and others ran into the kitchen to find Becky feeling around the kitchens trying to find her glasses. She has very bad eyesight, bad enough that according Eleanor she needs to feel around for her glasses on her bedside table since everything is a blur for her. She has worn glasses in a high prescription since she was a baby. 
Becky was crying her eyes out until Diane found her glasses in one of the food cupboards. Once she had got them back on she started saying that Sarah took her glasses. 

Nick called Sarah downstairs and she admitted that she did take the glasses. Everyone was disappointed but Eleanor and Paul proceeded to tear into Sarah about how cruel and nasty she was and how frightened and upset Becky was because of her. 

Sarah tried to explain that Becky had been taunting her about the photos and had been saying that she would be cropped out, but Becky's parents had no sympathy and said that maybe a ''bully'' like Sarah deserves that. Nick went ballistic and said that Becky had been bullying Sarah for years and they have laughed it off. Paul tried to say that Becky's ''girly teasing'' wasn't bullying and that what Sarah did was. 

Nick can see why Eleanor wants Sarah punished, but at the same time her daughter was the instigator and Nick doesn't agree with her wanting to punish their daughter after hers inflicted years of psychological abuse on her. Nick and his wife don't want to punish Sarah. Obviously it was wrong to take the glasses, but it was a response to years of torment.

Nick is leaving for London in 9 days. He has a rather big apartment back home where he already has 2 roommates. Nick has always known that when he leaves for London he would have to find a third resident. 6 months ago Nick's very close friend came to him, and asked very politely if he could move in when Nick leaves. The two other roommates were not Nick's friends prior to moving in so they don't know the actual rent. They pay a rather low rent for the average rent in the area but they actually pay 80% of the rent where Nick pays the remaining 20%. Nick pays for everything else in the apartment and it is his apartment on paper too. Nick figured he was gonna get a third roommate who would pay the same amount as the other two, so he would have more money for London.

Nick's friend however knows how much Nick pays, and he asked if he could move in and pay the 20%. Both he and Nick have always been bad with saving up money and Nick knew he really needed a lower rent so Nick agreed on a few conditions. Nick wanted him to take over the room with his furniture so he didn't have to pay for them to be stored. He agreed. Nick also didn't want to stress about the move because that was the last thing he needed. He knew Nick was doing him a favor so he went along.

Nick has been rather stressed and in a terrible mental condition ever since and just really needs to leave for London for a fresh start. He knows this. They both smoke way too much weed, and Nick wants to get away from that. A month ago he got a new job that pays a lot better. Now he wants to stay at his current apartment and not move in at Nick's place. At first Nick was furious. He came to Nick because he needed his help and now he doesn't want it. Nick calmed down and told him that he would still like to continue with their deal because it really suits him. He would still pay a very very low rent, live in a better area and in a bigger apartment. He told Nick he would move in if Nick didn't find anyone else. Nick never looked for anyone else as he was very comfortable with their agreement. He has now told Nick he won't move in and Nick is very pissed but is trying to avoid confrontation.

Judy is 28, first real job as VP of sales in a smallish manufacturing company. There are two other VPs but Judy has the most issues with the VP of manufacturing (Ben) who Judy feels always steps on Judy's toes (this is very important) and is super jealous that he's 65 and just got the job and Judy is a woman and is at his level. 

Last week Judy's boss was out of town so security company were sending Judy notifications. One night company called and alarm was going off. Judy drove in and was met by Judy's security company. Only one at work was bosses son who had his beats on and didn't hear anything. No obvious damage and nothing seemed missing so Judy went home. But next morning about 20k in samples were missing. Police came, could find no evidence of break and interviewed everyone and the detective told Judy he was 99% certain that the son walked out with the samples and asked if Judy wanted to have him arrested. Being the boss's son Judy tried to call Judy's boss and Judy's boss asked what the samples were, Judy's boss said they were an old unit and he'd deal with it when he got back. Judy said ok. 

Here's where Judy made the huge mistake, Judy asked Ben for his advice on Friday. He told Judy strait up ""Judy needs to accuse (son) in the staff meeting on Wednesday. If the detective said he did it, boss needs to know."" Judy has literally been sleepless ever since knowing what Judy should do. 

So meeting came and boss wanted to talk about the ""break in."" Judy spoke up and said that Judy was really sorry but all the evidence points to Judy's boss's son stealing the samples. At that moment Ben spoke up and said essentially ""oh hey about that, Ben forgot to tell you guys that Ben accidentally set off the alarm that night and Ben has the samples for Ben's trip this week."" Judy wanted to die. Ben absolutely set Judy up to look bad in this. Judy is shocked at how petty a 65 year old man can be. Like blown away in Judy's shoes.

A friend of Nick wanted to go to a restaurant for his birthday and asked to to RSVP so that he could reserve a table. The restaurant hadn’t been open very long, but it already had a built in audience since it was part of a franchise. About 25 people answered.

Nick is always the one that’s on time, which is early for everyone else, and that day was no exception. No one was there, not even Nick's friend, but still, Nick told the hostess that he was part of the group, and she told him that they already had the table waiting, but Nick must wait for his friend. That was fine, he got there 10mins later. He approached the hostess to ask her to take them to the table, and she refused. She said that she could only sit them if there was half of the people he had reserved there. They were shocked, they had never heard of such policy before, especially at a franchise spicy chicken wings place, and also they knew that their friends were not going to be there on time.

They had to wait for an hour and a half on the sitting room. They saw how the place went from mildly busy to packed, and from the sitting room they could see their reserved table and how they never touched it. They just wouldn’t let them go in until half the people were there.

At the moment Nick thought that it was because they didn’t want the waiter to get confused on their orders, but turns out that’s what he did later.

Maybe having only 1 waiter for a 25 people table and have him still wait on his whole section wasn’t a good idea, but he still made a lot of mistakes. If they asked for water he brought Coke and when they tried to send it back, he told them that it was already in the system and he had to charge them for the water in addition since he couldn’t delete the coke. He did this with several items and people had to pay double for food they didn’t order. The bill was astronomically high at the end of the night, and there was food on the table that no one touched because they hadn’t ordered it. They asked to speak with the manager and he said that the waiter was right in how he had handled it, and there was no way to fix his mistakes.

They only paid for the food they originally ordered and left.

These bets can be about anything. Nick bets you can't throw this piece of paper on X's desk from here for $20 or something equally benign. Sometimes Nick wins and sometimes Nick loses. When Nick loses Nick always makes it a point to instantly pay and not whine about it. Fair is fair.

3 weeks ago Nick made a bet with Jack. Jack is maybe 10 years younger than Nick even though Jack earns the same as Nick Jack is one of those guys who manages to spend his whole salary before the end of the month. No problem, they're all adults and can make their own choices. The bet they made was about blackjack. They were talking about casino games and Nick said did Jack know that the version of blackjack at a certain casino has a house edge of 0.74% to which Jack replied that it actually is a lot more. Time for a bet. The usual $20? Let's do it. Shake on it. Lets see who's right.

Boom, Nick is right. Jack asked Nick if he could pay later. Sure man, why not. It's only $20. All good.

A week passes by. ""Hey Jack, you still owe Nick that $20"". ""Yeah man, tomorrow ill get it for Nick, only have Jack's cards on Jack now"". Queue a few weeks of excuses and 'Oh sorry Jack forgot's. Yesterday a group of about 9 colleagues including Jack are sitting in the bar below their office after work and Nick sees Jack pay for a $7 organic craft beer with a $20 note. ""Hey Jack, that's Nick's $20!"" in a non confronting tone. Jack tells Nick that he doesn't owe Nick because the terms of the bet were not clear and that he therefor owes Nick nothing. Nick gets angry and proceeds telling Jack he is a cunt and that if Jack is a real man Jack should just bite the bullet and pay Nick reminding Jack Nick would have paid Jack straight away if Nick would have been wrong.

At this point Becky another colleague, arguably the hottest and most popular of the group, intervenes. ""Let it go, its only $20"". ""No"", Nick replies. ""Jack is an asshole for not paying Nick"". A little back and forth ensues and the group turns against Nick. In the end Nick tells Jack that Jack can keep Nick's $20, that Jack is a little bitch and that Nick hopes Jack enjoys his beer.

She was getting rid of some of his clothes and told Nick to take anything he fancied before it went to the charity shop.

In the box were lots of his clothes but also a box with his military dog tags and watches from when he was in the army, some coins too. Nick told her and she quickly realised and took the dog tags and coins out as she wanted to keep them.
There were 3 watches in the box and Nick asked if he could have the gold watch. She said sure and Nick took it along with a belt and necklace.

A few months passed and the watch broke. Nick took it to a shop to be fixed and the guy said it was super valuable and actually worth over £300+ if fully functional. He checked it out and offered Nick the £300 there and then.
Nick was at a hard point in his life and had car insurance due, rent due and money owed to a credit card and Nick's MOT due. Nick took him up on the offer and then excitedly rang his girlfriend to tell her.

At first, she got mad and said Nick better get it back and that she didn't give it him to sell it. Nick said that it was being given away anyway and she said that no, the clothes were to be given away but when she realised she had the box of dog tags and watches was in there, she took it out and only gave Nick that watch because it was Nick who asked.

Nick said that he was sorry for the misunderstanding but that what's done is done and he can't just go and get it back because the guy will sell it for a profit, not just to sell back to Nick for what he bought it. She asked how much Nick got, Nick said £300 and she screamed at him and said it was worth way more than £1,000. Nick checked this later and in fact it's worth around £800-900.

She then said if Nick had sold it then she wanted at least some of the money. Nick said he'd already booked his MOT and paid off his credit card. She cried and said Nick was an asshole. They spoke the next day and she said she was genuinely reconsidering their relationship.

Judy has an ex husband who Judy will start referring to as X. Judy's husband and Judy married 2 years ago, Judy had been divorced from X as of 5 years ago. Judy and X married at 20 and it just never was really going to work. Honestly surprised they made it 10 years.

Judy and her husband are not poor, but they do not spend frivolously. They have enough money for the life they live and that’s about it. No expensive vacations or anything like that. Now, X Judy guesses came into a lot of money shortly after the divorce. X got a new job or something Judy doesn't know, they don’t talk. X takes Judy's son for 2 weekends a month, and he ALWAYS comes back with something. Videogames and gaming accessories, shoes, sports equipment, clothes, shit even expensive colognes and a chain once.

Judy's husband and Judy cannot afford to spend on the kids like this, and the kids understand. They have what they need but ultimately they have to wait til Christmas or birthday if they want something like that. Judy has been seeing tension among the kids, Judy's husband's kids have been getting upset about the constant gifts Judy's son gets from X. Judy's husband thinks it’s a little ridiculous too, like X is just trying to show off, but he’s not going to tell X what he can and can’t get for his own son.

Since all the sheltering, Judy's son hasn’t seen his father. But last week Judy got a prime package with X’s name on it. It was a gift for Judy's son. Some game he wanted Judy doesn't know. Before giving it to her son, Judy decided this was going to stop. Judy called X and explained that it’s totally unfair to the other kids when they see him with all new things. And that if X wants to buy their son things they have to stay at his place.

X roared at Judy “Just because Judy's new husband can’t afford what I can for his own kids, I can’t give my son gifts? I worked hard for my money I can spoil my son if I want to, I don’t have to worry about your step kids feelings. I don’t have to buy my son less because you got remarried”

After that conversation, Judy really doesn’t know. X has every right to buy what he wants for HIS son, and Judy's step kids aren’t his problem. But Judy still feels bad, Judy knows they wonder why he gets all new stuff and they don’t.

Nick used to work there. It's grueling work. You work 10 hour shifts, and you're walking, stepping on steps, and bending over the hole time. It used to start at minimum wage, but now it starts at 10$. The ***CAP*** income for 99% of workers is 13$ an hour. Basically, it's a bullshit job. 

Nick still talks with a few people there and they say morale has been really low. There's been a major issue with shipments getting delayed, so they're out of a lot of product. This leads to a problem where you work for about 30 minutes getting the product ready, only to find out you don't have enough and need to undo that work, and re-do the work with a replacement. This is very physical work all done on a tight schedule while preforming other time sensitive, also physical duties. This always happens when it starts snowing up north.

At a thanksgiving-adjacent dinner, Basically-uncle was complaining about his employees. Keeping in mind that Nick is adding some context to his words and these aren't direct quotes, his complaints are:

1. too many people ""have to"" be fired because they fail a random drug test. 

2. on the rare chance that there's an issue with a machine, most folk opt to sit down after they've gotten as ahead as they can be without making a mess. He's tired of telling them to find a broom or other busy work to do.

It was a small sized mutt which looked a little like a collie, so they named her Collie. Collie is the 3rd member of their childless household of family pets, they had 1 more dog and a cat.

They had Collie let loose to run around the neighbourhood every evening, and she would come back in about 30 minutes. It wasn't that they wouldn't walk her, she just didn't do well with a leash and preferred to run around all by herself. Their other dog preferred to be leashed and Nick or his wife would walk her every other day.

One day Collie didn't return, it was 11 May 2018(yes Nick recorded down the dates). They were devastated and looked for her for weeks. Posters with reward, social media and shelters, they did everything they could. Eventually they gave up and accepted that they might never see Collie again.

Last month, Nick was visiting a client's house and on the way happened to see Collie entertaining herself in somebody's yard. Nick wasn't sure at first, but the similarities were definitely there, so he called out her name and she actually raised her head and responded, that confirmed it.

Nick told the 2 children that he would be taking Collie and left them his number, telling them to let their parents contact him for the expenses for 2 years, he would pay them. They tried to stop him but Nick warned them that they had stolen his dog and that stopped them.

Nick had been in contact with their parents and they begged him to return Collie to them. They said that they could even pay him for her. Nick said no, Collie is part of his family and they should have thought of that when they decided to keep a stolen dog.

They're in the same year but not the same class and they have different friendship groups so don't hang out often. Unfortunately he's not as gifted as Anna. He struggles academically and his grades are often below average. 

The school held assessments recently (not official tests just assessments to see what level everyone is working at). Anna did really well at everything as Judy and her husband expected. Tommy, also, met his targets in his tests too. The targets weren't that high but the targets are personal. Anna got the highest grades across the board. 

Yesterday evening Judy and her family all went to Judy's sister's place. Judy's parents attended, but they briefly left to do some christmas shopping. Anna and Tommy wanted to go with them which they said yes to. 

When they came back they were both in tears. They were selling giant cuddly toys and they both wanted one. Judy's parents didn't bring too much money and could only buy one and chose Tommy, because they were ''so proud'' that he managed to hit his target grades. Anna spent the return car journey crying and calling him mean things like dumb and ugly which made him cry too. 

When Judy's parents told Judy their decision Judy saw red. So the kid who only just manages to get average grades gets rewarded, and the kid who exceeds all her targets and is the best in her year gets nothing? Judy was absolutely fuming and had a go at Judy's parents for their bad decision. 

They left early and Judy's husband tried to say that Judy was overly harsh and that Judy should consider their point of view. Judy was not sorry. They chose Tommy over Anna even though Anna achieved more. It was unfair and unkind. She sobbed in the car and when they got home, and Judy had to promise to buy her a giant cuddly toy first chance Judy got.

1,"AITA for letting Nick's daughter be happy about her accomplishments? | Nick's daughter (he'll call her Lucy) is 18. She's studying her A Levels and wants to study medicine. Today Nick and Lucy went for lunch with Nick's parents along with Nick's brother and his family. When they left Lucy was in tears and is still crying now that they are home.  

Nick is pleased to say Lucy got an offer from Oxbridge. She aced the interview and got a conditional offer. While she still needs to get the grades in the summer, Nick is sure she will seeing as she's top of all her A Level classes and often gets 100% in exams, assessments and coursework. Nick is so proud of her.  

Naturally Lucy is very excited and was happily telling her grandparents and everyone else the good news.  

Nick's brother has a son, he'll call him Harry. He wanted to do IT or something like that, but unfortunately hasn't been accepted to anywhere he applied for. Understandable he's very upset. They're looking at other universities as well as things like apprenticeships or entry level jobs.  

Nick's brother had a word with Nick and Lucy, saying that while he's very happy for her, they should be a little sensitive because of Harry.  

At dinner Lucy was excitedly telling everyone about her uni. Nick and Lucy explored the place when they went for her interview and it's truly beautiful. She was talking about all the exciting things she'll get to do. Nick knows she was getting a bit too carried away but no parent wants to stop their child when they're this excited and happy.  

Harry was staring into his food the whole time. Nick's brother attempted to interrupt and steer the conversation away from Lucy/Oxbridge, but Lucy still had more to say. In the end Harry stood up and walked out. Lucy was still excited, but her attempt to say any more resulted in Nick's mother snapping at her that ''we'd all heard enough'' and that she should think about someone else for once. She called her a ''spoilt and rude girl''. Lucy started sobbing and ran out.  

Nick and Lucy left soon afterwards and Lucy was crying in the car. Nick is RAGING. Nick is sorry that Harry didn't get the place he wanted. Truly he is, but why should that mean Lucy isn't allowed to talk about what she's achieved? Do they have any idea how hard it is to be even considered to study medicine at a university like that?  

Nick is sorry, but this isn't primary school where everyone gets rewarded for ''making an effort''. Lucy succeeded and Harry didn't. Why should his failure stop her from being proud of herself?",False,False,4,5,1,2,1,4,Fairness,444
1,"AITA for making an ""unequal gift"" for his girlfriend on her birthday | So 5 months ago, on his(27m) birthday, his girlfriend(25f) bought Nick a drone as a birthday present. Nick was really happy and enjoyed that gift and Nick has decided to make something special for her. Nick had 3 months until her birthday. Nick has started brainstorming all kind of ideas and in the end came to the conclusion: it's not about gift as a material thing, but its about emotions (cpt. obvious). The thing is that Nick loves all kind of riddles, puzzles, quests, etc and Nick was trying to make his girlfriend join the dark side. After some time she also have started to enjoy theses kind of activities, especially break rooms. So his idea for her birthday present was to make her cool city quest. In his town, there are a few companies that organize city quest and they have only a few set quest scenarios. So Nick has decided to make his own super cool romantic quest. First of all Nick has searched for an app to make things easier, but Nick could not find one, so Nick made his own app for quest creation(putting markers on the map with description to guide his girlfriend through quest). Then Nick wrote a scenario. In the end quest included places of their first date, first kiss, etc. also Nick has added a few historical city places, it had to be fun and educational.

Three days ago the day has come. It was her birthday. Nick has showed her his quest-app and the quest had began. To keep thing short it was really fun, romantic and entertaining; they had a great time. It seemed that she liked it a lot. When they came home, they had a dinner, watched TV and started to prepare to go to the bed. At that moment Nick has noticed that his girlfriend looks sad. Nick has asked whats happened, but as always she said nothing, however after some time, she said that she is very upset that his gift to her was unequal to her gift to Nick. Nick has asked if she did not like the quest, she said it was cool, but she expected something more material and equally valuable as drone(around 100$). Then she started crying and said that Nick dont love her, and cannot spend 100$ on her gift. Nick dont feel like an asshole because Nick has put a lot of work(Nick is not a programmer, so Nick has spent many hours to make that app for quests) into that quest, but maybe Nick has done it more for himself than for her.",False,False,3,5,2,1,1,4,Fairness,435

Judy dated a guy for a year who was Judy's sister in laws best friend. He was super nice at first and then became a leech. He started borrowing hundreds of dollars from Judy and Judy's niave ass kept loaning it. He eventually owed Judy over $2000 - honestly, Judy'd stopped keeping track after a bit because you just don't expect your boyf to take advantage like that.

It got towards the end of their relationship where Judy was sending him money for food and he would recieve it and go and sit in a bar with his friends and stop texting Judy back. Judy decided to end the relationship due to feeling like this was going to be vicious circle and Judy had started having feelings for another man who was self sufficient and made time for Judy. There was no cheating, Judy ended everything properly and was honest.
He didn't like this and decided this was enough to not pay the money back - said Judy deserved it.

He blocked Judy on everything so Judy couldn't contact so Judy asked Judy's brother's wife to speak to him please because it isn't fair, Judy worked hard for Judy's money and he didn't have a job through their entire relationship. She said she didn't want to get involved and got really short with Judy and said Judy shouldnt of asked her to contact him and Judy was putting her in an awkward position.

Judy said that she was condoning his behaviour and a good friend would called their friends out on their BS and doing so didn't mean getting involved, just reassuring her friend he's pulling a D*** move.  Judy's brother then ended up getting involved and it started a lot of arguments until he finally came back to Judy and said Judy was in the wrong for upsetting his wife asking for help and told Judy it was Judy's own fault for lending money to someone in the hopes of them paying it back.

Judy never received the money and Judy's brother's wife and ex boyf are still best friends and Judy hasn't spoken to the wife, brother or ex in over 2 years now.

1,"AITA for reporting Nick’s son’s terrible school bus driver? | Nick’s son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in Nick’s neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he’s been riding the bus. In the years past, Nick drove him to and from school, but with Nick’s schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient.

Two weeks ago, on the first day of school, Nick introduced himself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to Nick’s son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would “try his best”.

That afternoon, Nick’s son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. Nick had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at Nick as they were getting off the bus, and Nick said “if you’re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. Nick told you to keep the bus quiet.”

After that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at Nick. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way.

Nick called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would “look into it.” After a couple more days, he hadn’t stopped with the dirty looks, so Nick called a few more times and they said that “nobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he’s the best one at the school” (which Nick sincerely doubts).

Nick mentioned the issue to his neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as Nick’s son, and she said that Nick is completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is “the nicest guy Nick would ever meet“ and that her children say Nick’s son is “extremely disruptive” on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn’t be riding the bus. Obviously this made Nick angry, because Nick’s son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.

1,"AITA for Nick calling up a mom the day before her son's Bar Mitzvah and telling her to invite his daughter? | Nick's daughter is 13 and attends a relatively small middle school with only ~50 kids in her grade. Everyone in the grade knows each other well, and for the most part all the parents know each other too. It just so happens based on the area that the school is in that almost half of the kids in the school are Jewish. So a lot of these kids are having Bar/Bat Mitzvah parties, and so far everyone that had a party has invited the entire grade.

Nick's daughter is socially awkward and does not really have friends. She's a very sweet kid, but extremely shy and Nick has heard that it comes off as her thinking she is smarter than other people (Nick doesn't see it, but that's what Nick has heard). A boy had his bar Mitzvah this past Saturday, and the day before Nick heard that he invited *literally* every kid in the grade except for a notorious bully and Nick's daughter. Nick was furious and upset.

Nick let himself calm down before calling the boy's mother, and she was clearly uncomfortable over the phone and just said that she let her son choose the guest list. Nick said that he could understand that even if the son was inviting 40 out of 50 kids, but to just exclude two is cruel. Especially since Nick's daughter is certainly not a bully. She did seem to feel bad but wasn't making any move to do anything about it.

So Nick said ""Nick is planning to bring his daughter to the party tomorrow, is that okay?"" She responded that they can't add another person the day before the party. Nick said that they invited over 200 people (including family, family friends, and non-school friends) and they can fit one more person, especially since at least one person won't show up. She ultimately agreed, and Nick ended up taking his daughter.

Nobody knows, including Nick's daughter, what Nick did, so it's not like the kids at school know and Nick embarrassed her (as long as the other mother didn't tell people). Nick feels bad for making the ""demand"" the day before the party, but that's when Nick found out. Nick knew his daughter would be crushed after the party if she found out everyone else was invited.

John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. Nick knew he was a phony from the beginning, since Nick is a member himself Nick noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when Nick met him at a party he told Nick stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. Nick has told Kathy and her friends his concerns but they never believed Nick because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Nick is guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk.

Nick was able to get someone Nick knew in the service to search up his name and Nick found that he actually enlisted but was dishonorably discharged within a week of entering for bad conduct. Obviously this means he is not a lieutenant and should not have any uniforms. Nick got this information within a few weeks before his wedding. There's several legal ways to do this but Nick doesn't want to get into it for confidentiality.

Kathy's brother emailed around 1600 making announcements for the wedding. This allowed Nick to get everyone's emails. Nick sent an email explaining all the discrepancies of his uniforms, stories he told, and finally proof submitting his discharge papers. Kathy decided to cancel the wedding and there was massive flame war that occurred, via email. Nick didn't even know that was possible but it happened. People went on saying how Nick was a scumbag that should've minded Nick's own business. Other people have told Nick that Nick should've told Kathy this privately but Nick feels everyone should've known that this man was a lying piece of shit. Kathy was initially angry but has now thanked Nick. Nick has gotten angry hate mail from John's family but Nick has ignored it.

but she's borderline-obese and getting worse, sorry but she buys and eats junk food literally every day. chocolate, candy, even just unhealthy-ass meals like cooked in hella butter, hot dogs and bacon always in the freezer, whatever

Nick has a problem with junk food too, he is still healthy-looking with a shirt on but being with a partner who has it around all the time has made him skinny-fat where he used to look athletic. he can't control himself around it any more than she can not drink alcohol if he brings it home. if it's around he is probably indulging

Nick told her around new years he wants them to eat healthy this year and be healthy and live a healthy life together and he can't keep doing junk food and they agreed on a totally sober and healthy january where they were gonna cook healthy shit at home, not eat out, not eat junk. he even bought them the ingredients for their first meal of the year, a bunch of veggies and chicken to make a soup out of

Nick told Judy that isn't an essential and she can use the money allotted to her for non-essential stuff for that.

1,"AITA for lying about an allergy at a restaurant and ending up at the emergency room? | Nick met this girl on Tinder and they really hit it off. Nick asked her out on a date to a cozy restaurant in their small town (Gainesville, FL). 

Nick had to take the bus there (his moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. 

The date was going ok. It was kind of awkward at first because they just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so Nick decided to break the tension. A while ago, Nick heard about a life pro-tip where if you order French fries at a restaurant without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. Nick had been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. 

When the waitress came in, they ordered chips and guac. Nick then asked the waitress, ""Does the Guac have onions?"" To which she responded, ""Yes, it does"". Nick then proceeded to tell her, ""Nick has an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?"" Nick told her Nick has an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, Nick's date asked him, ""are you really allergic?"" To which Nick said ""no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac"". She was pretty impressed like ""damn, I'm stealing this one"". When the guac came in, Nick asked her to give them onions on the side for his date. 

The rest of the date went well. They ordered some drinks first and then food later. What Nick forgot to do when he was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in his food. When Nick got his dish, he took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to him frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. Nick didn't know how to react so he just kind of dropped the food from his mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so Nick tells him that Nick forgot to mention not to put onions and that Nick has a severe allergy. 

The first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  

(Side note: Nick doesn't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in his family or any of his friends. Nick has no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but he knows that it like swells up your face and for some reason, Nick thought it makes you cough a lot, he doesn't know why he thought that.) 

Cutscene to now: Nick starts kind of coughing, but assures him that everything is going to be fine. Nick tells him, ""Nick barely got any onions in the bite"". Nick's date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to them. Nick told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that he's okay enough to go to the emergency room himself. Nick asked for the check but they insisted on him not paying. (Not like they ate anyway) but Nick still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only his fault and not the waitresses fault at all. 

After leaving, Nick's date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. Nick shot his shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where Nick grabs his bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. Nick is sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that Nick is taking the bus to the emergency room.  

He kept insisting that he drop Nick to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didn't want anything to happen to Nick. Nick finally gave up and told him, ""Okay"". In Nick's head, he thought he'd just let him drop him there and then he'll take an uber back home. However, they get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK. Nick is like hey man, trust Nick, HE'S OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to him. You can leave. It was so awkward. They were parked and he kept asking if Nick is sure and Nick is like yes he's sure don't worry, please leave you don't have to come in with him. 

At the end he said he'd just walk Nick in, use the restroom and leave. They walk in the emergency room and Nick is the only person there. Great. Nick had to walk to the nurse and tell her that he might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and Nick is like yes, everything is going to be okay. ""Thank you so much for everything."" He gives Nick his number and tells him to inform him once he's out. 

Here Nick is. A healthy 25 year old adult. Having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfU3k5g
Another nurse came up to Nick to take his vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and Nick had to sheepishly tell him, ""Nick thinks he might have been having an allergic reaction"". He says, ""Are you allergic to anything?"" And Nick goes ""No"". 

He gave Nick a benadryl and sent him out. Nick then spent another $25 to Uber home. Nick told what happened to his friend and she said he was the worst kind of asshole. Nick learned his lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but he doesn't think he was an asshole because he did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all his fault.

1,"Is Judy the asshole for wanting her husband to pay for her daughter's college tuition? | Judy married her current husband seven years ago. He has three children from a previous marriage and Judy has her daughter from a previous one as well. Two of his children are in college right now and one graduated in May, and Judy's daughter is starting high school in August.

Judy really wants her daughter to go to a top tier school as her daughter has stated many times she wants to either go to John Hopkins, Stanford, NYU or Columbia. Judy's stepchildren go to state colleges.

Yesterday, all of them were together for a birthday when Judy mentioned her daughter, M would start SAT classes. Judy's eldest step son J remarked that he and his sisters B and R never took SAT prep and did just fine. This led Judy to discuss how M wants to go to a prestigious school that would demand higher testing scores.

This led B, who for context purposes is always trying to start a fight even on a family occasion, to ask how M would get scholarships to go live somewhere and go to school at private colleges. Their father/Judy's husband refused to allow his children (with agreement with their mother) to send off to private or out of state schools due to the high tuition.

So, it would not be that far fetched that now, with his children locked in their current schools that both of their parents wanted, that Judy's husband and Judy would send Judy's daughter to a nicer college. Judy's ex-husband have not discussed yet what they would like for M, but Judy's ex husband does have two kids with his new wife. Judy thinks her ex-husband would be fine if Judy's husband and Judy paid for M's college tuition and expenses.

B hitched a fit that it wouldn't be fair for her siblings and herself if M got to go out of state. Judy told her that paying for three children to go out of state would be a lot of money, but that just paying for one is not as expensive. Also, Judy reminded them that their own mother agreed that they should stay in state for the lower tuition. B argued that her mother is still unmarried and could not afford the costs, so Judy had to repeat AGAIN that three children out of state is a heavy burden compared to one. Judy also said that her husband and Judy share finances so sending M to SAT prep and other things is Judy's right to do. If Judy's husband had wanted his children to go out of state with their money, Judy would not have been mad, which Judy told her stepchildren. It's really a matter to discuss with their own parents; not Judy. B then called Judy an ass, to which Judy told her to not use language like that.

B told Judy Judy was being inconsiderate, so Judy had her husband ask her to back off and calm down to which she refused.

B, even though she's an adult, acts very immaturely with her stepsister and always has, ever since they got married. B is eight years older than M but acts younger. Judy is taking her comments with a grain of salt, but Judy would like to gain outside opinions on this.

B and her siblings were quiet the rest of the evening, and B was probably trying to stir up more drama as it is. Judy's getting tired, frankly, of how B is constantly undermining Judy in front of everyone when Judy's really just trying to better her daughter's life. It's not Judy's fault Judy's husband and his ex-wife would not send their children out of state. His children act very entitled to their money but the way they conduct themselves causes Judy to doubt they really want a relationship with their father and instead just want their money. It's all about money to them. Judy knows they are happy with their current education, but the second M gets something remotely nice they all freak out on Judy.

So, does Judy really deserve to be called an ass when it's not Judy's fault they're jealous and acting entitled?

1,"AITA for comparing Judy's boyfriend to an autistic child who needed to be driven around to calm down? | Judy was driving Judy's boyfriend and Judy back to Judy's house (parents house) where they were staying that night. They had been having an argument about how he acts around Judy's family; Judy thinks he's unfriendly to the point of being rude (for example he has walked into a room where Judy's brother was and not bothered to say hi. Judy has had to tell him to say hello.) At the start Judy thought it was due to shyness which Judy was sympathetic to but recently Judy had gotten a bit of an irritated vibe off him and felt he just couldn't be bothered making an effort with them. Anyway, this is what they had been arguing about in the car and he had said he was sorry if sometimes he was in a bad mood, or tired and he wasn't overly enthusiastic around Judy's family to which Judy said that Judy would understand if he was only like that occasionally, but it was all the time. He then said that it wasn't all the time and Judy conceded and said ""ok, well you're like that 9 times out of 10"". He flipped at this and called Judy a liar, saying that Judy had lied when Judy said he was ALWAYS like that because Judy had changed it to '9 times out of 10'. He said Judy had lied and had admitted it by changing what Judy said immediately after. Judy was 100% that this did not make Judy a liar and Judy thinks it's just him nit-picking, but maybe Judy is wrong. At this point he was shouting at Judy which Judy hates and the argument wasn't going anywhere so Judy said Judy was done with it. They were close to Judy's house at this point and Judy asked him if they were going into Judy's house would he stop shouting as Judy didn't want Judy's parents seeing that, but he said he wasn't calm enough to do that yet. So Judy said ""So Judy has to drive you around until you've calmed down, like you're an autistic child?"" The reason Judy said this is because Judy has heard of parents of autistic children having to do this and it reminded Judy of this. So he completely flipped at this and started going on about how horrible a person Judy was for talking about autistic people like this. This is coming from someone who used to do an impression of a Down's syndrome person on a TV advert. He says he has changed since he used to do that and isn't that sort of person anymore. So they spent about 20 minutes more driving around as he was threatening if they went back to Judy's house he would go and ask Judy's parents what they thought about what Judy said. Judy couldn't care less if they knew what Judy said but Judy didn't want them being dragged into the argument. Judy told him he could message his friends to see what they thought, Judy doesn't know if he did. Judy asked if he had anywhere else to stay for the night as Judy essentially wasn't able to go home as Judy was afraid he'd drag Judy's parents into the fight. He eventually said he wouldn't do this and they were able to go home. Judy doesn't think he will speak to Judy until Judy apologises for the autistic comment. Judy thinks he was wrong in calling Judy a liar when Judy doesn't think Judy was and for having Judy drive around for ages because they weren't able to go home because he was threatening to make things awkward at home.

1,"Was Nick the asshole for continuing to ask a woman if she would be quieter during a concert when Nick felt she didn't answer the question with her response | Nick was at the city theatre for a concert with a family member. Everyone was sitting down and it ranged from gay men and a few lesbians to families to a lot of women in their 30’s at this show.

During the opener, a band which was great, playing some 80’s hits (Hungry Like The Wolf) singing along having a good time, and then the two women behind them started to get loud. Just talking and laughing. And the music for the opener wasn’t really that loud, so they were overpowering the music really. Enough times that the person Nick was with did the little shoulder glance back so Nick knew it was bothering them, and Nick knew it was bothering him, and now Nick felt justified, it was bothering the person Nick was with.

Nick actually gave it another minute after Nick decided he was going to ask them to be quieter because maybe they were gonna settle. It was cool to have fun, they were just a bit too loud. So they continued, and Nick turned around to face them, and Nick said and made a point to be as polite as Nick could (because this was something Nick was really working on with frustration) and said “I’m sorry, will you please be quieter?”

Now this was where Nick needed some feedback to know if he was an asshole. Neither woman looked at him, and Nick was directly in front of them, and in their face not as in leaning in, just they had to see him, Nick was directly in front, not to the side. The one Nick was really talking to, the woman behind him who might be a bit older than him but not a huge amount, said “Sorry.” Nick wanted to be clear, this wasn’t a nice sorry. It wasn’t like a genuine “Oh sorry” where she might not have even known she was too loud, and Nick didn’t want to embarrass her, Nick would have said no worries at all, have fun, just thanks for being quieter.

But she didn’t, and it was a throwaway sorry. And she didn’t even look at him. Nick was really not angry, but Nick wasn’t accepting that as an answer, because it was the kind of treatment where it would be very possible for her to just go back to doing it in a minute. So Nick said, ""You don't have to be sorry, but will you please just be a little quiter?"" I’m sorry” same tone as in she might as well have said fuck off, and no look to him but just above him. ""I really don’t want a sorry, are you gonna be quieter yes or no?” The person Nick was with pressed his leg so Nick knew to reel it in, so after she said “I said I was sorry” Nick turned around and left it.

And it wasn’t a problem again.

Hindsight being 20/20 it would have been better all around to have just turned back after the sorry and if she continued then acted again.

So was Nick the asshole for pressing it? Reading it back it sounded like it, but it was just a moment of really offering as much as Nick could to be polite about it and when it was just a whatever given back to him Nick wanted it settled. Nick did get that him obviously imposing a yes or no answer on a stranger likely painted him the asshole, but it was asked as a genuine question, Nick just dropped polite words as it went on.",False,False,3,4,1,3,1,2,Fairness,609
1,"AITA for refusing to switch sides of the bed with pregnant wife? | Nick's wife is about 12 weeks pregnant with their second child and recently she asked Nick to switch sides of the bed with her. Nick has slept on the right side of the bed for as long as Nick can remember, every house, every relationship, back to when Nick was a kid living at home with his parents. Right now they're in the process of buying a home so they're living in a small two bedroom double-wide. The two bedrooms and the bathroom are the end of the hall on the left side of the house in a sort of U-shape. Their bedroom is small and from his wife's side of the bed it's maybe a ten step trip, unobstructed. From Nick's side it's probably about seven or eight steps. Not really a huge difference, and on Nick's side there's a large dresser.

Nick politely told his wife Nick wasn't going to switch. She got huffy with Nick and told Nick Nick obviously didn't have any concern for her condition or their unborn child and Nick didn't care about making her life easier. Nick pointed out that when she was pregnant with their older child they lived in a small two story apartment where the bathroom was on the ground floor and the bedrooms were on the second floor and she never had any trouble with that, so why is this any different? She's not high-risk, she's having moderate-to-light morning sickness that has been lightening up over the last couple weeks. She's chasing their toddler around with no problems. Nick is sympathetic to her situation, Nick really is, of course Nick wants his wife-pregnant or not-to be comfortable and happy but Nick doesn't see how this small change is going to make a lick of difference.

Nick doesn't ask for much. They're an equal relationship as far as childcare, housework, financial, work, etc. Nick doesn't sit on Nick's butt drinking beer and watching her do everything, Nick gets up and does Nick's part and then some. It's what keeps them happy and their relationship good. All Nick's asking for is to keep Nick's side of the bed. But Nick's wife insists that if Nick doesn't give her Nick's side of the bed that it means Nick hates her and the unborn baby. No amount of Nick trying to show and tell her how much Nick cares about her and the baby will change her mind.

Another reason Nick doesn't want to switch are because his wife has to have a fan on when she sleeps and the only place they can keep the fan is on her side of the bedroom. They only have two outlets in the bedroom, the kind where each outlet has two sets of plugs, one on top, one on the bottom. One is behind the top of the bed and the other is on the wall beneath the window on her side. Nick would be too cold. Nick's side of the bed is just the right distance to be comfortable. Nick would need extra blankets and his wife says it'll make her too hot so Nick can't do that. And her side is right next to the window and Nick has trouble with bright light when Nick first wakes up, Nick gets headaches.

Nick doesn't know what to do. Nick knows this is a really stupid hill to die on and honestly Nick is ready to give up, but Nick is still just really confused, like why is this a big deal? AITA because Nick just wants to keep Nick's side of the bed?",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness,606
1,"AITA for supposedly ruining Nick’s girlfriend’s big moment after she received a prestigious scholarship? | Nick and his girlfriend are in their early 20’s and have been together for 6 months. A few days ago she found out she was selected as a Fulbright finalist and will be moving to Europe in August for 10 months. Nick’s extremely proud of her and he’s happy that she’s fulfilling her dreams but he can’t help but feel a little sad that she’s leaving. Nick’s been trying his best to keep those feelings contained and to just be happy for her but it’s been a little difficult and he’s sort of been distant with her these past few days.

Last night they were at a bar celebrating this girls birthday party but also kind of celebrating Nick’s girlfriend’s huge achievement. Long story short, she started posting on Instagram and Snapchat right next to Nick about how she’ll be living in Europe in a few months and will meet one of her friends in Paris. Nick didn’t say anything but having her flaunt that in his face when she knew it was a sensitive subject brought down his mood and made him shut down. She then went to the bathroom so Nick got on his phone for a little bit and was still on it when she came back because he was reading something. Admittedly, Nick didn’t really feel like talking at that moment and the phone was his escape but he couldn’t have been on there for more then 5 minutes after she came back. She then told Nick he looked miserable and to go home if he was having such a bad time. Nick told her he wasn’t having a bad time and he was there for her. Nick questioned why she was upset and she kept telling him to just go home because he looked miserable but Nick said no. She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as Nick followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling him to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to Nick saying “BABE” implying she wanted him to follow her and get in the car but Nick just said “No, I’m not going with you” so she gave him the middle finger and took off. That last bit made Nick upset and he texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn’t some game where she runs away and he immediately goes chasing after her. She said Nick looked miserable when he was on his phone and humiliated her because he couldn’t even hold a conversation. Today they talked about it more and she says that she’s incredibly hurt because it’s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around Nick. She says Nick’s excitement for her isn’t genuine and that he says all the right things but doesn’t mean them. She says she understands that Nick’s sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure he felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration they would start having those conversations about how she’s feeling. In response Nick said, “If it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we’ve really talked about it.

Nick transferred to this university and has already made a good amount of friends. One of his close friends at the university lives next door to Troy. We saw Troy in one of our classes since he is in the same major as us so we thought we'd introduce ourselves. He tells us he does not have a bunch of friends which motivates his friend and him to help him make friends. At this point, Troy seems like a cool dude so far.

We start inviting him to parties and other social events to help him make new friends. Almost every time he gets to the parties we invite him to, he goes off by himself to socialize with other people, which is good. But Nick noticed that when we meet up with him after Troy's wandered off, he acts differently. He acts as if we were friends for a long time and becomes rude to us in front of his new associates. For example, when we tell him that we are planning to leave the party, he tells us to stop trying to rush him or says something like ""does it look like I want to leave with you guys right now?"" in front of his new ""friends"". Like bro, we are just telling you we are leaving. He would talk down on us as if he has superior intellect compared to us, always sounding condescending.

Couple months pass and Troy takes some classes abroad in Europe for like 2 months. Troy comes back from Europe and he starts saying stuff to us in Dutch (he's not European) and talks with a Dutch accent. Fast forward 1.5 years later, we all have summer classes together. We invite Troy to a kick back with a couple of his other friends. He still brags about Europe and talks with a German accent. His friends and he find it very annoying that this guy clings onto this one thing and talks as if he himself is German. For example, we would talk about some subject and Troy would be like ""Well in the Netherlands..."".

Like dude stfu, it has been so long since you've been there, Stop clinging onto that ONE thing. So Nick tells him ""no one cares that you have been to Europe for like 2 months that happened more than a year ago and stop trying to be something you are not. No one finds it interesting that you do that. Not only that, you are always acting like you are smarter than everyone else when you're not. Sure you got the academics, but you are a social fuck up.

1,"AITA for refusing to pretend to buy Nick's girlfriend drinks? | This is going to be ridiculous. Forgive Nick.

A few weeks ago Nick's(31m) girlfriend(22f) of 8 months invited Nick to go bar hopping with two of her friends. They are also a couple so this was a double date. Nick doesn't like her friends but Nick agreed to go to make her happy.

As she was putting on her makeup, she told Nick she had to ask a favor. She asked Nick to pretend to pay for her drinks in front of her friends. She said she would give Nick cash before they left to make it look like Nick is paying when she is actually paying for herself.

From the beginning of their relationship they’ve agreed to keep their finances separate. They buy gifts for holidays and birthdays, but do not pay for each other for anything else. They pay separately when they go out to eat. If she asks Nick to pick up something just for her when Nick’s at the store, she gives Nick the exact change back. Nick likes this arrangement as it proves to Nick she is not with Nick for Nick's money. Obviously Nick would not be with her for her money as she is a poor college student.

It’s come to Nick's attention that her friends are much more shallow than she is. Nick was shocked by her asking Nick to pretend to pay for her. Nick asked her why. She said her friends tease her because Nick never pays for her. Nick said Nick’d think about it. Nick felt inadequate as a boyfriend when she said that to Nick. Nick started wondering if Nick should just pay for her. Then Nick realized that this is manipulative on her part even if unintentionally. Nick was not going to be guilted into paying for her, or be humiliated for not paying for her.

Nick told her no which ended up snowballing into a bad fight. She started to cry and said that her friend’s boyfriend (the one they were going drinking with) always spoils his girlfriend and it makes her feel bad Nick never does that for her. It made Nick feel like shit to hear that. They agreed that it was for the best to keep their money separate and now she wants to flip the script. Nick spoils her in other ways. Nick allows her to live with Nick rent free because Nick loves her. Nick told her that Nick doesn’t care what her friends do in their relationships because the only thing that should matter is what works in THEIR relationship.

They went out for the night and Nick refused to play along. She ended up paying for both of their drinks for the night. When Nick’d go to ask for 2 checks she’d passive aggressively say it was “fine”.

Things were a bit tense after that night, but a few days later things were back to normal. Or so Nick thought. They got into a small fight last night again about something unrelated. She brought up that situation again, saying Nick acted like a complete asshole that night. Now she is giving Nick the cold shoulder.

Nick did not think Nick was an asshole. Nick thought she is immature to want to make her friends think Nick’s her ATM. However Nick’s starting to wonder if Nick should’ve handled it differently because she is very upset.

1,"AITA for Judy cutting contact with her sister and asking for her gifts refunded after she lied about her babies gender and her due date | Judy is 21, Judy's sister Rachel who's 28 had her first baby 2 month's ago and it's been a hellish nightmare for everyone since she announced she was pregnant.

When Rachel fell pregnant she told everyone that they would be waiting until the baby was born to find out the gender, wich really didn't suit any of Judy's family and especially not Judy as Judy would like to buy little bits and pieces for baby as the months go not suddenly find out and have to buy everything at once.

Knowing Judy's sister who is extremely impatient in all matters, Judy knew she would end up getting a gender scan even if she didn't tell her husband Nick.

So every day Judy would sent her a message asking if she knew yet and would drop the question in to conversation.

She told their mom Judy was driving her insane with the constant asking but Judy thinks it's 1000% normal to be excited to know if you'll have a niece or nephew and to begin baby clothed shopping.

Anyway fast forward to Rachel being 17 weeks pregnant, Judy sent her a text asking if she knew yet and lo and behold she text back saying yes she had a scan and it was a girl.

Judy was through the roof with excitement but then Rachel text her again to say that she wanted gender neutral gifts only.

She was extremely adamant about the gender neutral gifts so Judy did 80% neutral and jut got a few pink dresses and frilly pink sleep suits as they were gorgeous.

Fast forward to 36 weeks, Rachel drops bomb number 2.
She sends a group message on whatsapp to say that as she will be nedding a c section because her baby is breech she only wanted herself and Nick at the birth.

Judy asked her if she was joking and she said no, so Judy wasn't even allowed to attend the birth of her future neice.

She tried to talk Judy round via text saying she was terrified and that she wanted peace and quiet for her c section and said although Judy doesn't mean to Judy talks alot in exiting situations.

Judy found that incredibly insulting but dropped the issue as she wouldn't budge.

And then comes the ultimate bombshell, 2 days later Nick calls to announce the arrival of Judy's nephew, not neice, nephew.

1,"AITA for refusing to pay for a laptop Judy's daughter ""broke""? | Judy's niece, Samantha (19), has always been a prickly girl but Judy never quite expected this. Judy and her husband have been visiting family and while they have been spending time sight seeing and spending time with Judy's sister, Samantha has been babysitting their child. Judy uses the word babysitting very lightly here. Judy's daughter (Lila) is very quiet and well behaved and babysitting basically consists of being in the same house as her while she plays games on her phone, reads or watches TV. Lila is not loud or very boisterous, so it's not a big deal. Despite this Samantha kicked up a real fuss when she was asked to look after her and demanded compensation, saying that expecting her to help out was unfair unless she was getting paid. For reference Samantha isn't a social butterfly and she basically lives at her computer, and Judy believes she did all of this just to be rebellious and cause a fuss, but that's besides the point. Judy is just providing some context about her character. Her mother ended up paying her in the end and aside from some initial grumbling when Judy and her husband left the first few times, things settled down. Until a few days ago.

Judy and her husband arrive and Lila is crying and Samantha is in HYSTERICS, claiming that Judy's daughter went into her room while she was in the bathroom and spilled soda all over it and now it's completely ruined. She shows them the laptop and it won't turn on at all. She then doesn't ask but tells Judy and her husband they WILL be paying in full for new one. Now, here's the thing: one, Lila absolutely hates soda. Hates it. Fizzy things make her feel sick and she outright refuses to drink anything but water. Samantha, on the other hand, guzzles it down like it's nothing and easily goes through 2L a day. Two, Lila is a small girl and is nowhere near big enough to somehow get up onto a bed or desk just to upturn soda on it. Judy and her husband asked Samantha where her laptop was and she said on her desk. How on earth was Lila meant to get up to her desk to begin with? It's taller than she is. Three, as Judy recalls Samantha had a big history of lying as a little girl blaming other people for what she did. She would break something and immediately point fingers at somebody else and Judy doesn't see that having changed. Four, Lila insists she didn't do anything and she didn't even leave the living room. Judy trusts her daughter.

Judy's husband wanted to give in despite all of this but Judy put her foot down and refused. Judy is very confident that it was Samantha, not Lila, who ruined her own laptop and she just saw Judy's daughter as a convenient way to get a new one from them as her mother doesn't have a lot of money. Judy doesn't want to enable that behavior or make Lila feel as though she doesn't believe her. Judy's husband agrees that he thinks Lila is innocent and Judy's sister told Samantha she was out of line to shout at them demanding money, but this has caused a big ripple throughout the family and Samantha has stormed off to her fathers house and now he's hassling Judy's sister over it all.

1,"AITA for asking his fiancee/girlfriend [28F] to work 80 hours a week in order to pay off her debt in time for their marriage? | Nick has been doing the same thing since last November.

Nick has $70K in debt, all of it student loans. Nick got a second job. It will take him until the beginning of next year to pay off his debt. Nick is looking at working about 80 hours making $130K. It sucks, but Nick realized he is not going to get out of debt quickly any other way.

She has around $60K debt. She financed her father's treatment for cancer (who is thankfully in remission) on credit card.

She works as a teacher working 60-65 hours a week making around $65K. Nick told her if she works another 15 hours tutoring people she can easily make $15K-$20K. She can easily be debt free in around 18 months. If she gets another job or starts tutoring people, Nick can help her and she'll be done quicker.

She is calling Nick an asshole because she already ""compromised"" by agreeing to do a budget.

Nick told her doing a budget means nothing if they are not cutting their spending and increasing their income.

She said that working 80 hours a week will be bad for her mental health (she has a history of depression).

Nick told her that he had/has depression (as diagnosed by the doctor). If he can do it, she can as well. Nick also told her that her mental health will be worse with the debt hanging like an albatross on her neck. Hell, paying of debt is important for his mental health because it is stressing him out.

She resents the fact that she, in her words, ""never sees me"" and that this will hurt their relationship.

Nick told her that if they didn't figure out their debt problems, they would definitely get divorced because money problems cause fights.

She said Nick was a asshole and cheapskate because Nick is demanding they reduce their spending on food by not going out, not eating fancy stuff like avocado, and not spending money on Netflix. Currently, they are paying $450. She thinks that $350 per month on groceries between the both of them is too low. It isn't.

Breakfast: Milk and banana ($0.40)

Lunch: spaghetti ($2) or salad ($3.50).

Dinner: two cheese ($2) or tomatoes/cucumbers without cheese($2.50) sandwiches.

Total is ~$5-6 per person per day, per month ~$180. They can meet the $350 guideline if she stops buying avocado ($0.50 per avocado), she only eats salads on the weekends, and they shop at a different grocery store for some other things.

Nick told her to cancel her gym membership ($40). She can run on the streets. She called Nick an asshole for suggesting this. Apparently, Nick wasn't checking his ""male privilege"" because she feels afraid as a woman, running at night. She has never told Nick this before. Nick told her they can arrange their schedules so she can run with him. Nick cancelled his gym membership and runs alone in the park.

She wants to go on a honeymoon after their wedding, but if they don't get out of their debt, Nick is not going to enjoy the honeymoon because he will feel guilty due to debt.

She is now calling Nick an asshole for valuing money over her. She thinks Nick is being ""too intense and obsessed with debt."" She says Nick is trying to control her life.",False,False,3,4,2,3,1,3,Fairness,584
1,"AITA for Judy telling her brother maybe he'd have a different perspective if he ever left the small town he lives in? | On a recent trip home to England Judy got into a fairly robust discussion with her brother about people who choose to raise their children gender neutral. She was in England with her husband as she and her husband were visiting her friends and family. She is English but she and her husband live in her husband's home country, Australia, where they have lived for 12 years. They get back to visit every 2 years or so. One evening, about 10ish days into the trip her brother, his gf and another friend of theirs came to her parent's house (where she and her husband were staying for the duration of the trip) for supper. Her brother lives in the same small, rural town as her parents, about a 5 minute walk away. He never leaves this town, other than to go to work in a nearby, larger town. Judy cooked a meal and they all (Judy, her husband, her parents, her brother, his gf, and their friend) sat around eating and chatting. It was so lovely to have her family in one room as the relationship between her parents and her brother had recently become difficult.

In the context of a discussion about gender fluidity, they began talking about the subject of raising children gender neutral. Her brother was adamant that it was a bad way to raise children, whereas her husband and she put forward points that disagreed with him. The discussion wasn't passionate but robust. She argued that kids don't need gendered toys and that an absence of this might give kids more freedom to think of themselves in their own way. Neither her brother nor she have children so the discussion was hypothetical. He argued that not gendering children might lead to an absence of workers in certain stereotypically ""macho"" fields, eg. deep sea welders (his example). While she argued that she didn't think this would happen because gender neutral doesn't mean boys can't do stereotypically boy things and girls, stereotypically girl things - it potentially offers children choice for girls to engage in ""boy"" things and boys, ""girl"" things.

She became frustrated that he wasn't picking that up and resorted to telling him that if he ever left the small town he lived in he might get a wider perspective on social issues. She knew it was a low blow but said it anyway. He left after supper, saying goodbye. The next day she received a Facebook message from him stating that he ""didn't want to know her anymore"" and that she shouldn't come back every 3 years and judge the way he lives. She didn't respond because she was hurt, shocked and didn't want to give oxygen to what she thought was an overreaction. He proceeded to cut off contact completely. She hasn't spoken or had contact with him in a year now. She recently tagged him in a funny IG post that she knew he'd appreciate bc she wanted to try a softly softly approach to get in touch. He blocked her, and has completely cut her off.

She recognises that she shouldn't have had a cheap dig at him, but she's really upset that a previously close relationship now no longer exists because of one comment she made. AITA here?

TL;DR: Judy told her brother maybe he'd get a better perspective on gender issues if he left his small town once in a while. AITA?",False,False,3,4,2,1,2,3,Fairness,582
1,"AITA for expecting Nick's girlfriend to drive him to work? | So, here's some backstory. Nick (23TM) had his partner (21F) of a year move in with him last month. She works online for a local office, and Nick works 30min away at a fish hatchery. Nick has epilepsy and can't drive, and until recently he had been paying a friend quite a bit to drive him to work because his apartment isn't by a bus. Leading up to moving in, Nick's girlfriend had been giving him rides more often, and seemed happy to help. They've never gotten into any argument they weren't able to solve within half an hour or less. They are both very peaceful, they have all of the same hobbies, and just generally get along great.

They both like more traditional relationships. Nick would never expect anything of a partner other than being equal, but right from the start she made it clear she wants to be a homemaker, cleaning and having him come home to hot meals every day, and eventually they want to adopt and raise kids with her at home. It is a relationship dynamic that works well for both of them as she doesn't do well with traditional jobs (anxiety), and most of the time Nick doesn't have it in him to cook or clean when he gets home. He does not ask her to pay rent because she doesn't work very many hours, but she does pay for their groceries, their cell phones, some dates, and is all around a very helpful person.

Today, she brought up how it is inconsiderate for him to assume she will give him a ride to work every day since she moved in. She isn't even mad that Nick didn't formally ask her, she just that she thinks it's too much for him to expect. Nick tried to explain how he felt to her and apologized for assuming anything without talking about it first. He also mentioned he felt it was something you should just do in a long term relationship. He did NOT say that he feels he deserves rides because he pays rent, or say/even think anything like that, but the way she reacted made him feel as if he had shamed her or something when he has never mentioned anything like that, just the rides. She shut him out for the rest of the day, and he had to pay his friend to drive him when he really didn't have the money. When he got home, she was asleep.

Nick's least favorite thing is being shut out and not being able to resolve things immediately, and she knows this. There is nothing barring her from being able to do this, she can work whenever she wants so it doesn't hinder that, also it's not money because she is able to save tons by not paying rent. She often goes out when he is at work (which he doesn't have any problem with, she can go out whenever she wants), so she is driving anyway. He doesn't think it's too much to ask for, but she does, and even said that she doesn't want to feel used for rides, but he doesn't want to feel used either. He does realize that she would be spending 2+ hours a day driving him which is the reason he is questioning if he is completely wrong on this one.. So AITA here, or is she being unreasonable?",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness,581
1,"AITA for not changing Nick’s “argument routine” now that his wife and Nick have a child? | So Nick’s wife and Nick have been married for 2 years, together for 5 years total, living together almost the entire time. For the longest time, they’ve had pretty much the same “routine” when they get into arguments. Usually it starts out with Nick either forgetting to do something or doing something wrong, his wife sees it, lets loose on Nick about it, and decides that it’s now a good time to bring up all the other shit Nick does or has done since their last argument that bothers her. Nick does his best to listen but once they reach the point where she’s laying it on too thick or Nick feels like she’s being unfair, Nick leaves the house. If it’s a Friday or Saturday Nick just goes for a long walk around the neighborhood and comes back a couple hours later. Any other day of the week Nick will drive to his job, which he has a key for, and try to catch up on some paperwork for a couple hours. Nick then goes back to the house. Usually by then she has calmed down, but if not Nick’s last resort is to go stay at a friend’s house or Nick will go back to work and sleep in the empty retail space upstairs, Nick has actually got a pretty cool setup there with an air mattress and a travel toiletries kit he put together last year.

Despite the fact that they get into these arguments, they have what Nick would call a pretty good marriage. 6 weeks ago, it changed a lot because Nick’s wife gave birth to a little boy, their son. She got another 6 weeks of maternity leave, Nick had 2 weeks off then he had to go back to work. Last night they got into their first big argument since he was born. Nick went through his usual routine, and ended up deciding he needed to sleep at work that night. When Nick woke up this morning, he had dozens of angry texts and a few missed calls (Nick’s phone automatically goes to Do Not Disturb after midnight) from his wife. She was pissed that Nick is still “pulling this crap” after the baby was born. She’s always understood Nick’s routine before, and actually at one point said she was happy that Nick is able to turn a bad night into a good morning (because Nick gets extra work done and he’s always on time the next day). Nick gets that she would want help with the baby but he was fine when Nick left, he was asleep in his bassinet and he had just had his diaper changed and drank a full bottle of milk about an hour before that. Nick can’t stand to be in the house when she’s going on her rants and Nick doesn’t see why he should have to sit there and take it from her just because at some point in the next few hours she might need help with something. Maybe she should’ve thought about that before she decided to belittle Nick. Nick loves her and his son and he’d be happy to help with any of his needs but Nick has to stand up for himself, Nick isn’t going to be a pushover and let her walk all over him just because her hormones are acting up.

1,"Was Nick the Asshole for reporting a group of girls in his class for being excludatory to himself and others? Nick is a 19 year old college student studying art & design. It's a small class with under 20 students, most of whom are female. There are only 3 guys in the whole class, one of whom is Nick. Over time the class has naturally divided into 2 separate social groups. One one table there is a group of girls and 2 guys who are quite studious/quiet, they tend to just get on with their work. On the other table there's another all female social group who are very boisterous and chatty. Nick sits on the edge of this table.

Now, the girls on Nick's table are by all means not awful people. However, being the only guy on the table Nick has noticed that they treat him significantly differently.

With each other, they're always joking around and having banter, spouting memes and generally goofing off. Whenever Nick interacts with them, they are friendly and polite, but they don't have any banter with him. It's like they think Nick is incapable of having fun, when in fact that's his EXACT sense of humor and pretty much how he is with his bros.

Another thing Nick noticed is that with each other they talk about movies and video games, two things he's really interested in. Not once have they spoken about those things with him. Usually they will only talk to him about classwork. Nick also noticed that he seems to cease to exist when they're all present, but if only one of them is in early or something, and he's the only available option, THEN they'll talk to him.

They very rarely interact with the two guys on the other table either. To Nick it definitely comes across like they dislike them just because of gender.

Nick recently started feeling more and more excluded when he would hear the girls on his table talking about stuff in their group chat (which he's not a member of), and hearing about them hanging out outside of class and having all these inside jokes he can't understand.

So, that brings us to monday of this week. Nick arranged to have a meeting with their main tutor after class, in which he basically told him everything he's written here. He pretty much said there isn't much he can do in a situation like this because he can't force friendships. He said the only time he can really get involved is if there is actual bullying going on.

Nick then asked the question ""Is socially isolating somebody to the point where they want to drop out of college considered bullying?""

He said yes it would be, so Nick said that would mean he is being bullied. His tutor said he would then have a talk with the girls on Nick's table, and Nick went home feeling better about the situation.

Turns out Nick shouldn't have felt better because now things are worse. When he came in the next day he was ignored completely. They don't even attempt to talk to him anymore. Nick also gets the impression that they're constantly laughing at him in their group chat.

Nick has spoken to a friend about the situation and he said Nick should never have gone to his tutor about it. Nick disagrees and thinks it was worth a shot, but he's open to other perspectives. So reddit, was Nick the Asshole?",False,False,3,4,2,3,1,4,Fairness|Proportionality,577
1,"Is Nick the Asshole for telling a professor that Nick thinks his class is a joke and walking out? So this semester Nick started taking an intro web design class. Despite attending 3 classes though no one has any clue what to fucking do for the class. This is where J comes in. J is a 60 something guy who is the professor for the class. He's some industry guru who made a lot of money in web programming and he let us know that right off the bat.

The problem with J is that he spends the whole lecture time trying to be ""hip"" and impress us by being funny and making ""radical"" comments. He starts each lecture by pulling a desk to the front, taking his shoes off, and connecting with us. He then proceeds to just stand there and ramble about stuff that is vaguely related to the topic while not teaching us anything. Wednesday he spent over 25 minutes letting us philosophies on how we should layout a web page despite the fact he hasn't taught a single html tag in class.

The worst part by far though is the work load. For the next 14 days we have various small irrelevant things due and almost 4 chapters of reading. Despite being a web programming class, tonight we have to write a page paper pretending to ""advertise"" our website. The thing that pissed Nick off though is that he never announced any of this in class or through the announcement channel. Last night we had our first reading and first project due (4th day of the semester). We had to build a simple site in html despite the fact he never announced that 2 chapters of the book were due or the project in class. This morning when we came people were complaining and he told them ""tough luck"" and to pay closer attention to the due dates.

As class was getting started people were still complaining so he announced that he would reopen it for tonight but Nick raised Nick's hand and told him that it still does not make it right because he has yet to teach us anything about html. He then told Nick that it's Nick's responsibility to read and learn and that he won't be repeating what's said in the book because that is ""not his job"". He then said that the book will teach us and we are supposed to come to class with that knowledge.

Most of the kids in this class are freshmen with only 3 or 4 seniors like himself filling the credit requirements. Nick has never had a class like this and every programming teacher Nick has had at least introduced us to the languages before and Nick told him this. He got defensive and told Nick that this is preparing Nick for the real world. So Nick stood up and with everyone looking at Nick told him ""Well, if the real world will consist of an out-of-touch old man who is more concerned about being cool than setting the people below him up for success then Nick might as well give up now. If it isn't clear Nick is dropping this class. You're a clown and Nick is not sticking around for this"" and walked out.

1,"AITA for asking Judy's brother and his fiancee to change their wedding date? | Judy's brother has been with this girl for 7 years. They were never interested in getting married until Judy got engaged. She got Judy's brother to propose with Judy's mom's costume jewelry. It wasn't even a real ring. They announced their engagement only a few weeks after Judy's. It was a slap in the face because Judy's fiance went through the trouble to save up for a real diamond ring and he planned a romantic getaway to propose to Judy. Judy's brother and his fiancee got engaged on the fly with a fake ring and everyone was congratulating them like it was a real engagement. It cheapened Judy's engagement, honestly. Judy's brother was never into the idea but she forced him because they have a child together and he lives in her house.

Judy's brother's fiancee has always been controlling and weirdly jealous of Judy, and Judy noticed that she copies everything Judy does. Judy wanted her wedding to be a unique event because Judy's fiance and Judy waited so long to get married. They have been together for 9 years.

Judy and her fiance announced their wedding date and then Judy's brother and his fiancee announced their wedding date right after them. They set their wedding only a month after Judy's. It annoyed Judy but Judy didn't say anything. Then Judy found out that she scheduled her bachelorette party the same weekend as Judy's. Also, she copied Judy's dinner menu and stole some of Judy's decoration ideas. It looks like their wedding will be nearly identical to Judy's.

Some family members who live out of town said that they'll be going to Judy's brother's wedding, but not Judy's. Judy was very devastated. They said that it's because the wedding dates are so close together and they can't afford to go to both weddings. Judy chose her date first and Judy's fiance and Judy don't live together yet. Judy's brother and his fiancee live together and they have a kid, so why are they rushing to get married?

Judy's mom and Judy invited Judy's brother and his fiancee over to their house and they asked them to postpone their wedding date. Their weddings aren't until July and August so they have plenty of time to change the date. They made a lot of excuses like they always wanted a summer wedding. Judy asked them to at least change some things about their wedding so it won't be too similar to Judy's. They got pissed off. Then Judy asked why they're even having a wedding. They already have a house and a kid together. Judy's brother's fiancee said that she always wanted to walk down the aisle in a white dress. Judy's mom jokingly asked her if she should even be wearing a white dress because she has a kid. Judy's brother flew off the handle and screamed at them. He called Judy a lot of names and then they stormed out of Judy's house. It has been about a week and they're still giving them the silent treatment.

Judy's mom and Judy are trying to work with them to make sure that both of their weddings go smoothly, but they won't work with them.
