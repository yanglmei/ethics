0,"AITA for allowing one of Judy's bridesmaids to wear a suit? | Judy had five bridesmaids for her wedding. Judy's soon to be MIL was paying for their dresses as a wedding present. She told Judy it could be whatever Judy wanted within budget. So Judy picked a colour and they all went shopping together. Judy's MIL didn't come because she lives across the country. 

One of Judy's bridesmaids approached Judy and told Judy she was really uncomfortable wearing a dress and asked if Judy would be okay with her wearing a suit in the colour Judy picked instead. Judy said of course Judy didn't mind and that they would still pay for it. The bridesmaid was so happy and seemed so relieved. 

Well, the dresses and suit were all ordered, fitted, paid for by Judy's MIL. And were now with their bridesmaids. They all sent Judy pictures, they all looked amazing. Judy sent Judy's MIL the photos saying how happy Judy was and that Judy was incredibly grateful. Judy's MIL immediately called Judy SCREAMING saying Judy had robbed her! Judy was extremely confused and it took quite awhile for Judy's MIL to tell Judy that she was angry about Judy's friend's suit. She told Judy she hadn't agreed to ""pay for a fucking d*ke's disgusting lifestyle"". 

Judy and her MIL were not particularly close, but it never occurred to Judy that her MIL was homophobic. Judy guessed it should have but her MIL lived in a very liberal area and was very eclectic. It hadn't crossed Judy's mind. Judy told her that it's just clothes, and it shouldn't be such a big deal. The bridesmaid was going to look good at the wedding and that was all that mattered to Judy. Judy's MIL demanded Judy pay her back for EVERYTHING, saying Judy had deliberately violated her beliefs. She also said that she was ashamed that her son would pick someone of ""such disgustingly low character"" to marry. Judy's fiance happened to be in the room for this conversation and saw that Judy was about to cry. He took the phone from Judy and asked his mother what she was saying to Judy that could be so upsetting. 

She told him to call off the wedding. That she refused to come if he didn't, and if they didn't pay her back she would sue. He looked at Judy, frowned, and walked into another room. About an hour went by before he was done talking to her and came back out. His immediate words were, and Judy quoted, ""Jeez I forgot that she's a fucking bitch"". Apparently he got her to calm down enough to agree that they would pay her back for just the suit. But she ""didn't know if she would have the stomach to see that d*ke in her costume"" and wasn't sure if she was coming to the wedding. Judy was appalled, he was mad as hell. He told Judy he would take care of paying for the suit and not to worry about it. Judy and her fiance agreed that they shouldn't tell Judy's friend because the friend had faced so much homophobia within her own family and they wanted her to feel safe at her friend's wedding. 

Over the course of the next week Judy's fiance got calls from a bunch of his family members (including ones that weren't actually coming to the wedding) saying things that ranged from some homophobic bullshit to ""yo your mom is crazy"". 

Reason Judy thought Judy might be TA: they did say dresses and Judy went and bought a suit.

0,"AITA for keeping Judy's baby | Judy posted about not wanting to have an abortion but now Judy’s learned more information and Judy needs to know if Judy's the asshole for not having the abortion.

TL:DR- Judy was about to have a 2nd oophorectomy (removal of ovary) on Fri but on Mon Judy found out Judy’s pregnant. Turns out the father is married. Wants Judy to have an abortion. AITA if Judy doesn’t?

The background is Judy (32f) met this man (33m) after Judy moved back to Judy’s home town when Judy left Judy’s abusive husband. Judy and he have been dating for 6 months.

This man was charming and persistent. Judy told him Judy wasn’t ready for a relationship because Judy’s marriage was so damaging but he swore up and down that Judy would never feel like that again and he would always be there for Judy. They spent weekend trips together, every night they are together. When they met he said he had a roommate who didn’t allow guests. Then that roommate suddenly wasn’t paying rent and he (bf) couldn’t pay his ex’s rent and his so he “had no choice” but to move her in. After that when she wasn’t home Judy was allowed to come over to his house. They had separate rooms, Judy believed that it was just temporary in order to save money. His lease is up in Aug, they were talking about moving in.

Last month Judy’s period was 5d late. Judy told him Judy didn’t know what Judy would do, Judy would probably want an abortion. He told Judy he would never want that, they would make it work and he loves Judy. As Judy was waiting for the results Judy was sick thinking about an abortion. How could Judy do that? Thankfully the test was negative. Judy’s period was late due to a large cyst that was discovered shortly after.

Judy’s surgery to remove the cyst is scheduled. He’s promised to be there every day to help Judy with Judy’s son. Judy found out Judy is pregnant on Mon. He said he was happy, excited. The next day he told Judy Judy had to have an abortion. This is where the sh*t hits the fan. Judy told Judy’s sister about what was going on and Judy’s sister decided to do the truth finder search. Turns out they are married. And a few other lies he told Judy were discovered from the same search.

Judy drove to his house knowing she was home and he was asleep. Judy talked to her, she was shocked. They confronted him together. They’re both leaving him. Judy was devastated to hear they were taking Judy’s remaining ovary. Judy wants this baby. Judy can’t fathom terminating. He has a 3 year old and a 9 month old with her. He told Judy he wasn’t sure the infant was even his...obviously he is.

He says Judy’s having the baby out of spite. That Judy shouldn’t have the baby because Judy hates him. Judy’s forcing him to have a baby he doesn’t want. It’s so confusing because all he did was talk to Judy about how sad he was that the test last month was neg & how he would have taken care of Judy, he said he was sad about that because he wanted kids with Judy. This baby is a miracle.

AITA for keeping the baby and expecting him to keep his promises even if they aren’t together? It’s going to be so hard, Judy knows this, but Judy can’t have an abortion.",False,False,4,3,2,1,5,3,Purity,589
0,"AITA for charging client full price for massage after a poop accident and she left for half hour? | Throwaway account, and not a shit post! (Pun intended lol)

Warning: this post may be gross.

Nick is a licensed massage therapist. Nick currently works at a spa, and Nick pays ""rent"" for his massage room. Before treatment Nick asks what areas they want focus on. This client,(F30s?), expressed she was having some pain in her lower back and glute(butt) muscles.
Nick leaves the room, and Nick told her to dress down to her comfort level.

This client booked for 1 hour massage. About 15 minutes into the massage, Nick tells her that Nick is going to pull back the sheet and start work on her lower back.

Now the gross part. The client wasn't wearing underwear, and when Nick pulled back the sheet there was brown liquid mush around her butt crack. This wasnt just a skid mark or not wiping very well, but the sheet now had what appeared to be poop on it. Runny yet sticky at the same time. The sheet was gross.

Nick has never been in this situation before, and Nick didn't want to embarrass her. Nick couldn't continue the massage, it would be a health hazard and it was smeared all over the sheet and some of her lower back. Nick said to her oh Nick is really sorry Nick thinks she might need to go to the washroom and clean up a little. Nick will give her a few minutes and let Nick know when she's ready. Nick left the room and heard her go into the washroom. 15 minutes have gone by and she hasn't come back out, so Nick knocks on the door and asks if she's okay. She responded Yes I'll be out in a minute. But that minute turned into another 15 minutes, so she was in there for a half hour! She came back out and Nick continued for 15 mins. When Nick finished, Nick left the room for her to get dressed and met her up at the counter to pay.

This where Nick is wondering if Nick is TA. Nick charged her the full amount for the massage, because she books the one hour time slot, and Nick had another client after her so Nick couldn't exactly run late. She got really mad saying she should pay half the price! Nick explains that Nick was sorry, but the hour was booked for her and it would be the same if somebody was late, they would still have to pay the full price of the time slot that they booked. She started yelling at Nick at the front desk saying how unprofessional Nick was. She eventually did pay, and later that day there was a review that she posted saying how Nick ripped her off and charged her more money than the actual massage.
Nick's partner said that Nick should have given the poor girl a break, she obviously was ill and Nick should have charged her half of the amount even if it meant Nick was losing money. Nick's coworker that Nick discusses this with said any other professional, like a counselor would be charging the full amount that's just what professionals do, and Nick is NTA.
So reddit, AITA?

0,"Nick yelled at his stepmother? | This happened a few months back, Nick just wanted to get the opinion of others on this matter since Nick still thinks about this moment quite a lot.

Some backstory: in 2016 Nick's brother passed away because of a stomach sickness. Ever since then, they’ve laid his ashes to rest in the cemetery of their hometown. Nick's biological mother adorned the grave with little fences, plants, pretty gravel and such. It looks darling, and it makes her feel good to have something to keep neat as she visits.

Nick's stepmother thinks she's spiritual. She claims she can commune with spirits, though only does this when she’s drunk. Sometimes, she brought up Nick's brother, which Nick personally doubts since Nick's brother did not like her at all.

Cut to a few months into Nick living with his father and his stepmother. In the weekends, they would go out and come back drunk. Sometimes, they’d argue with one another, getting pretty loud when it was around 1am already. Nick had gotten used to this behaviour to a certain degree and usually tried to sleep through it. This night, however, they were being particularly loud.

When Nick woke up, he heard his father telling his stepmother that she had no business at ‘his grave’. Still being groggy, Nick opened his door (first floor, they were on ground level) to listen in on their fight. The fight proceeded with Nick's stepmother lecturing Nick's father about what he does at Nick's brother’s grave, which was supposedly reminisce about the past, and how it would keep his spirit here. Nick's father told her that even if that was the case, she had no business with touching his grave.

Nick listened in for a bit more and heard more about Nick's stepmother telling Nick's father for only thinking about the past with Nick's brother and not ‘telling him’ about the future. And because she felt like Nick's mother has ‘trapped his spirit’ by putting the little fences around his grave, she removed them and threw them away.

This is when Nick snapped. What manner of thinking allows her to mess with the grave of Nick's brother, who didn’t even like her to begin with? Nick did not go to directly confront her, but Nick yelled at her as loud as he could from the first floor, how she was to disrespect and chastise their family, Nick's brother, like that.

Nick slammed his door shut. Immediately, everything went quiet. Shortly afterwards, Nick's stepmother went into the car and drove off. It wasn’t until two weeks after that they were on speaking terms again. According to Nick's father, Nick's outrage had hurt her quite a bit. Nick told him that Nick likes there is a certain line you can’t step over, no matter intentions.

Even if she thought that the decorations she assumed were ‘trapping the spirit of Nick's brother’, the least she could have done was to bring her concerns up with both Nick's father and Nick's mother, who have the most right to worry over his grave. Yet, in a drunken fit, she simply drove up there, took the fences away and drove off again.

0,"AITA for forcing his wife to get rid of one of their cats? | Nick personally is not a fan of big blocks of text. So Nick is going to keep this as short as possible.

Nick and his wife have been together for almost 7 years (married 8 months). When they started dating they both lived at home and his wife's family has always had cats, where Nick's family were dog people. They moved in together 3-4 years into dating, to a place that didn't allow dogs but allowed cats. Nick was adamant he didn't want a cat, but deep down he knew his wife would be over the moon if they adopted one from their local shelter. So for their first Christmas living together, Nick surprised her and gave his wife some cat food and food dishes to unwrap. Nick told his wife to go adopt the cat she wanted and Nick would pay for everything, including the pet deposit at their apartment. His wife was so excited she cried.

Fast forward to summer 2018. They live in their newly purchased home and are set to be married in September. Nick's wife's sister brings over an abandoned kitten (approximately 2-3 weeks old) that was covered in dirt and oil from being stuck God knows where. Nick gets home from work and sees the cat there and immediately tells his wife that they aren't keeping him. But as the night went on, every time Nick looked at his soon to be wife her eyes were saying ""pleassssse"" without her actually saying anything at all. So of course Nick gave in and they kept the cat. On the condition that his wife makes sure their house is well kept and doesn't smell like cats.

They did the right thing and took him to the vet. Only to find out that he has an abnormal heart/possible heart disease. The vet says when he becomes an adult, his heart will not be able to keep up with his size and he will essentially just... drop dead. They were upset, but determined to give him the best life possible with what time he has left.

Here is problem. He is an asshole of a cat. He terrorizes their older cat to the point where she hates being in the same room as him. He constantly is leaving scabs on her. She feels forced to sleep in extremely high locations that are currently out of his reach, just to get some alone time. Worst of all, he is pissing every where and their house stinks. Nick is embarrassed to have anyone over. Having him fixed to combat his spraying isn't an option due to his heart condition. Nick finally had it with everything and told his wife to get rid of him. Nick loves their first cat much more, and her life is reduced to hiding from him. But selfishly the biggest reason Nick wants him gone is because he is making their house a pig sty. The smell hits you as soon as you open the back door.

Nick is not looking for advice. Mainly because nothing is going to change his mind. Nick just was curious what everyone had to say because his wife is fairly upset about having to get rid of him.",False,False,4,3,2,3,5,4,Purity,543
0,"AITA for being embarrassed Judy's boyfriend called out a wedding party at a 9/11 memorial? | So off the bat, Judy agrees with Nick's sentiments but disagrees on the way Nick handled it. Judy's boyfriend and Judy, along with Judy's sister and her SO, were out for Judy's birthday, walking around a park.  At this park there’s a large 9/11 memorial that lists all the names of the people who died and has a somber feel to it, however it’s also in a sunny spot in a beautiful public park.

Judy's boyfriend mentioned how some people have started taking their wedding photos in front of the memorial, and how it’s becoming an issue because it’s disrespectful; people have posted wedding photos at the memorial with all the names photoshopped out. Judy's sister and her SO agreed and noted that the memorial in their city also has lots of people taking silly selfies and stuff that’s not appropriate for what it is.As they walked back, they noticed a wedding party (including the bride in her wedding dress, groom, kids, parents, the full party) in front of the memorial, taking photos. They couldn't walk through the memorial because of the photo-taking, so they went around.

As they were about to come up on them, Judy's sister’s SO and Judy's boyfriend started joking (so they thought) about confronting the party or making them feel bad for using the site. Judy's sister and Judy both begged them not to, but in a slightly joking tone (they were laughing and smiling) because they didn't think they were serious. Then as they passed, Judy's sister’s SO stayed quiet but Judy's boyfriend went up to them and yelled out “It’s a 9/11 memorial, you shouldn’t be taking those pictures here!” or something along those lines. Judy couldn’t remember clearly as Judy felt so embarrassed and kept walking. Nick didn’t linger or confront anyone directly, and by the time Judy glanced back Nick was already walking away from them.  Judy isn’t sure how much the wedding party understood what was going on, but they definitely looked confused/concerned momentarily and stared at them as they passed. Luckily there was no further confrontation. Judy's sister and Judy basically power walked away from them.

Afterwards, Judy's sister and Judy basically felt it was rude and didn’t accomplish anything besides put a damper on someone’s special day, but Judy's boyfriend disagreed and seemed happy with what Nick did (and Judy's sister’s SO agreed with Nick). Judy has never been embarrassed like that at something Nick’s done and Judy feels kind of bad Judy wasn’t able to be supportive - instead Judy just disagreed with Nick while not even directly facing Nick and then abruptly stopped talking about it. So, was Judy's boyfriend rude, or did Nick do the right thing and Judy should support it? Did the wedding party deserve to be berated or are they free to take pictures wherever?

0,"WIBTA if Nick did not let his sibling eat animal products in Nick's home? | For background, Nick's SO and Nick are both vegan and have been for 2 and a half years. There are many reasons why, including the typical reasons, but Nick has allergies to animal products which are avoided in a vegan diet so it's like getting two birds stoned at once. Nick's sibling is twice Nick's age (Nick is in his 20s) and both were born in the same country but Nick grew up in a western country and his sibling still lives in the same country.

Nick's sibling will be visiting Nick's SO and Nick in the near future and they are excited for her to visit. But... they are on the opposite sides of the dietary spectrum. Inevitably, the food conversation came up. They expect her to eat vegan with them but she doesn't want to budge. She will be spending a few days with some extended relatives who eat meat-heavy so in Nick's opinion, she won't miss out. Nick doesn't have any issue with his sibling using her own money to buy animal products but she wants to accompany the meals they cook with animal products and doesn't want to eat ""fake meat"" which Nick understands. They don't really buy meat-alternatives unless they are with omnivores at a BBQ or something. Also, Nick does not want her to use Nick's utensils or pans or sponges or sinks because of Nick's allergies. For example, Nick has a ""typical"" dairy allergy which is the most prominent one and while it's only ""serious"" if Nick ingests any, even touching dairy will give Nick major hives. Her other compromise is to only have dairy and eggs but those are still animal products and dairy allergy aside, they aren't comfortable with those being in their home.

Nick's SO and Nick are not comfortable with buying any animal products for her as it goes against their own beliefs. Nick's sibling is not paying for any part of her visit which Nick doesn't mean to hold over her head or anything but it means that they would be breaking their own morals for her comfort since they'd be buying her food for the majority of her trip. She has pointed out that they buy animal products for their pets but Nick personally does not believe in imposing his diet on obligate carnivores that they chose to adopt. Animals are viewed differently in her culture which Nick acknowledges but Nick doesn't believe humans will die from a few days of eating no animal products. They want her to be as comfortable as possible and acknowledge that her cultural experience with food is different from their own but Nick's sibling and Nick cannot find a good resolution or compromise.

Both were raised Christian although they had very different experiences. Neither identifies as Christian anymore and religion isn’t something that either really cares about or enjoys talking about.

Judy's mother on the other hand is a devout born again Christian and has a tendency to ask Judy really direct questions that Judy doesn’t enjoy talking to her about (example: in high school she used to ask Judy if Judy was a lesbian just out of the blue from time to time since Judy didn’t have a boyfriend). Well, a few years back this lead to her just asking Judy if Judy still believed in god to which Judy told her that Judy didn’t really know and that Judy didn’t want to discuss it further. Judy's mother freaked out and started crying and has occasionally tried to convert Judy ever since.

Well, this weekend Judy's mother came to visit Judy for Judy's birthday. It was the first time Judy has seen her in about a year so Judy was pretty excited. When Judy's mother got there everything was fine but on the second night of the stay she says she has a birthday present for Judy and then proceeds to hand Judy Judy's old bible (which Judy told her she could keep multiple times). Then Judy's mother tells Judy to open it. When Judy does, there are two $100 checks- one for Judy and one for Judy's fiancé. Judy's mother told Judy that they each need to read the book of John and then they can cash the checks.

Now, Judy has nothing against any religion. Judy is a firm believer that people should be able to do or practice whatever they want as long as they are not harming others. But personally, Judy wants nothing to do with this. Judy feels offended that Judy's mother would bring that book into Judy's home and then try to pay Judy and Judy's fiancé to read it. But Judy also doesn’t know what to do with it. Judy can’t just throw it away so now Judy feels stuck with it. Judy still wants the $200 so Judy is also probably going to read it despite feeling like Judy is going against Judy's own beliefs by doing so. So Reddit, Judy is not really sure where Judy stands with this.

0,"AITA for texting the group chat about a used tampon sitting out in our bathroom? | Nick currently lives in a house with 3 other roommates. All of them are in college. The 3 girls Nick lives with are fucking gross, to put it lightly. They are all best friends as well, so Nick thinks they kind of enable each other. They do not clean up after themselves and they completely neglect things like dishes, cleaning up after parties, etc. It's only for the semester that Nick lives there, thank the lord.

Recently, Nick was in the shower and noticed a used tampon on the side of the shower. It's totally bloody and engorged from the shower water, and the blood is dripping down into the shower. Gross.

So, after getting out of the shower Nick realized no one was home. Nick thought a lot about how he wanted to address it, and decided to text this exactly in the house group chat: ""Hi, someone left something in the shower. They should clean it up as soon as possible.""

Fast forward to later, people had presumably come home and whoever it was took care of it.

The next day, one of the girls asked to talk to Nick. She basically told Nick that all 3 of them had separately looked in the shower trying to figure out if it was them that 'left something,' and that, through process of elimination, it was figured out who the culprit was. She kind of condescendingly told Nick that she understands where he was coming from but that Nick really embarrassed the girl that did it (even though Nick still doesn't know who did it, he supposes it's now a secret between them). In return, Nick told her that his intention was not to embarrass anyone, that it was unsanitary, and if she was suggesting Nick clean it up instead. She told Nick she's not quite suggesting that but that Nick really shouldn't have addressed everyone about it.

Nick didn't apologize and told her that he did what he thought was appropriate. However, Nick is now wondering if he was in the wrong for how he handled it. Nick asked his mother and she said Nick should have just cleaned it up, but Nick's mother has relatively poor judgment and will avoid confrontation at all costs.

0,"AITA for not picking up ""Nick's"" dog's poop? | Nick is 16 and in foster care. He is immunocompromised, and has a chronic immune system condition that he has to take daily medication for. Nick's social worker gave Nick and Nick's also immunocompromised childhood friend with the same condition who is in the same area now proper masks and gloves a few months ago, which Nick uses whenever he is outside or his friend comes over.

Nick doesn't love his current place, but it was his only option. Nick's foster parents have two younger kids with them too that Nick has to help out with. They also have two very large and frequently aggressive Rottweiler looking dogs that are mostly kept tied up in the back yard that Nick has to do about 90% of the care and walks for. The adults are rarely home as they also have a severely disabled child that has a lot of emergencies.

Nick will be honest. He doesn't like dogs or understand them, and he may actually be allergic. Aside from the small fluffy ones, they scare him. He is also much smaller for his age, so he can't really physically do the care anyway. He has to have his friend come help for walks. Nick's friend is stronger than Nick and can get them to submit enough and tie them up properly at least.

As part of their condition, they can't handle fecal matter, especially animal fecal matter, at all. In a few years maybe, not not now, which is sad, because Nick does like cats. They could end up in the hospital for things that most people can shake off in days. Even changing a diaper right now would be an intense procedure. English isn't their first language, so their doctors gave them medical notes that they can show when they need to explain.

Obviously, on these walks, they struggle to control them, but the larger complaint from neighbors is that they poop everywhere. They've tried to explain the issue and why they don't have a choice in walking them, and why they absolutely cannot clean up after them, but the complaints about it keep coming. They also complain about their care in general, but they can't do anything about that either. They can't just run free, they're dangerous and hate kids. But the larger issue is the poop. Animal services never did anything before and wouldn't come out now, and Nick can't call or he'd get into huge trouble and potentially end up in a much more dangerous situation.

0,"Was Nick the asshole for leading the prayer in class despite being openly atheist? Nick is 25F, a grad student. For this story, it is important to disclose that his country is predominantly Roman Catholic, the grad school Nick currently attends is Catholic, but Nick is openly atheist and has been one since Nick was 11 years old.

Earlier today was Nick's first meeting for this subject, the heaviest major units wise for the semester. Nick's professor (70M, religious, is known to have opening and closing prayer every period) made eye contact with Nick and asked Nick to lead the opening prayer. Despite being an atheist, Nick led the prayer and said a safe Our Father (Nick memorizes the prayers because Nick studied in Catholic schools and Nick's family is Catholic)

The reason why Nick did this was because Nick didn’t want to risk a possible negative reaction, interrogation, or debate with his professor which could ruin the professor's impression of the class. You know how some old religious people view atheism as subversive and wrong especially in a predominantly Catholic country like Nick's. Nick wasn’t forced to lead the prayer, but Nick just sucked it up and did it anyway since Nick felt that reciting an opening prayer for one minute outweighed the possible consequences to the class if Nick's professor reacted negatively to Nick declining to lead the prayer due to Nick's atheism.

A few hours after, one of Nick's classmates calls Nick out and says that they felt offended at what Nick did because Nick knowingly disrespected the Catholic faith by reducing solemn and holy prayers into a meaningless vocalization. They say that prayers should always be said with meaning and that Nick shouldn’t have led the prayer when Nick is not a spiritual person and doesn’t even believe in God. They say that only Catholics should lead the prayer as a respect for the faith.

Nick explained to them why Nick did what Nick did (same explanation as above), that Nick was put on the spot, but they still insist Nick is in the wrong and that Nick still shouldn’t have led the prayer since Nick is an atheist.

Nick shared this story with Nick's friends and has garnered mixed feedback. Was Nick the asshole?

She has some developmental disabilities, hates showers and washing her hands, but she still understands why she needs to clean herself and why it’s important. These past few weeks, Nick had noticed that the underside of her fingernails are caked with dirt and who-knows-what. When she gets close, Nick gets whiffs of garbage and sewage. Nick has no idea why she’s not embarrassed by this, he’s sure kids at school have noticed. Nick has sent her to go wash her hands several times and it just doesn’t work. Her mother will say “oh, but her disabilities” as though this is something she doesn’t have to learn.

Yesterday, Nick snapped and dragged her over to the bathroom. Nick showed her the soap and a nail brush and demonstrated how to thoroughly wash her hands. Nick refused to let her out of the bathroom until she’d scrubbed her hands clean to his satisfaction. She started crying and whining that Nick was being mean and unfair, but he was firm on it. Finally, after she scrubbed her hands several times, she showed Nick that they were clean. Nick said, “That wasn’t so bad, right? If you do it often it won’t even take that long.” She nodded, Nick gave her a hug, and that was that.

Nick's wife came up to him and started screaming at Nick for imprisoning their daughter and treating her like she was a 3-year-old. They've had so many disagreements over this.

Nick and his fiance both agreed they didn't plan on baptizing their baby. Nick's parents are pretty pissed about this, especially Nick's dad, and started an argument with him over it.

They asked why they weren't getting her baptized and Nick said it's because they're not religious so they don't see the point. Nick mentioned that if she decides she wants to be baptized when she's older then that's fine with him. Nick's parents argued that they're all Catholic since they were baptized so she should be baptized as well. Nick said again that his fiance and he both aren't Catholic so they're not doing it to which Nick's dad replied that since they were baptized they ARE Catholic, they're just not practicing Catholics.

Nick told them again that he doesn't believe in God and they're not religious so until their daughter decided for herself they weren't doing it. Nick's dad said ""well what if you're wrong? I won't even say what would happen then"". Then Nick's mom made some insane comment about ""where do you think humans came from?"" and ""if we evolved don't you think they would've found fish dna in humans years ago?"".

Nick's dad says that if she decides to do it when she's older she'll be embarrassed getting baptized as an adult and ""what if she wants to get married in a church?"". Nick replied ""how much does it mean to her then if she'd be embarrassed about it?"" and Nick's dad started going off about how Nick wasn't giving him a good enough reason and he'll just have to take her to get baptized.

So AITA for not getting Nick's daughter baptized ""just in case""??

Some background info - Judy's sister (14F) takes showers/changes her clothes probably once a month. She doesn't brush her teeth, comb her hair, use deodorant, or clean her room. Judy's parents have done nothing to change this. Currently they're on a roadtrip. (Judy (16F), Judy's sister, Judy's mom, and Judy's dad.)

So they arrived at a hotel a few hours ago, and they booked 3 rooms. (One for mom, one for dad, and one for them.) Judy was completely fine with this, but to be honest, Judy's sister stunk really badly. Judy asked her sister to take a shower and to switch into some clean clothes before she went to sleep. Her sister refused and offered to sleep in a chair that was in their room instead. Judy tried to convince her sister to just take a shower but she was adamant about sleeping in the chair so Judy pulled some sheets and pillows off of the bed and gave them to her. Problem solved.

Then Judy's mother came into their room and freaked out when she saw Judy's sister sitting on the chair. She asked Judy why Judy wasn't letting her sister sleep in the bed, called Judy selfish, and told Judy to remake the bed and let her sister go to sleep. Judy told her mother Judy asked her sister to take a shower. Her mother called Judy selfish again, and Judy told her mother that her mother should let Judy's sister sleep in her mother's room if her mother's fine with the smell. Her mother walked out of the room mad. Afterwards Judy's sister decided to take a shower, Judy remade the bed, and her sister is currently falling asleep as Judy types this.

They usually have a great relationship but recently they've been at each other's throats over this. Judy can't tell if this is a real problem or if it's just because they're cooped up.

The problem is that Judy eats a lot of foods her boyfriend considers gross. Some of these are foods everybody considers gross, and others are things just he does. 

Things he thinks are gross: melted cheese, shredded cheese, hummus, chickpeas, fries in milkshakes, this Indian yogurt Judy eats, and peanut butter with nothing else.

Things probably everyone thinks are gross: pickles in milkshakes, ketchup in rice, capers and their juice, and mangoes and cheese. There are probably others Judy is forgetting. 

Anyways Judy likes these foods and Judy gets that others think it's gross, but Judy doesn't really think it's hurting anybody. 

Recently though Judy has been eating them more, and as both her boyfriend and Judy are home all the time in a small studio, he's been seeing it a lot more. At first he just told Judy what Judy was doing was nasty and moved on, but now he's started getting angry at Judy when he sees Judy eating these things and others he thinks are gross.

Today they got into a fight over it. He wants Judy to stop eating all these foods he thinks are gross. Judy thinks he's being ridiculous. Judy always cleans up after herself, and it's not like Judy is rubbing it in his face that Judy is eating these.

Let Judy say Judy loves Judy's brother dearly, but Judy has one massive issue with him and it's his hygiene. Not that he doesn't shower or anything like that, but it's the fact that he DOESN'T WASH HIS HANDS.

Everyone in Judy's house has gotten onto him for it. Even before Judy moved back in, it wasn't uncommon to hear Judy's mom tell him he needs to wash his hands. After Judy moved back home, everyone started getting onto him even more because of the fact that Judy was pregnant. He has to be told to wash his hands after doing pretty much anything or else he just straight up won't or will just run water over them. That includes after tasks like handling raw meat and going to the bathroom. It's bad enough that everyone keeps lysol wipes around to wipe door knobs off with.

Judy also likes clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. Judy refuses to take her son over there because Judy has been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn’t a place for children.

Judy's boyfriend isn’t like them. He doesn’t do drugs. He doesn’t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites Judy but Judy just can’t go. They went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. Judy made him take them home after 10 minutes.

His mother and brother often ask Judy for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on them before. His mother once left some marijuana in Judy's boyfriend's car. Like she dropped it and didn’t notice.

Judy doesn’t want them around her son. Judy doesn’t want to hang out with them. Judy doesn’t want to be around them.

Her daughter has very poor hygiene which has caused quite a bit of discomfort for Judy since Judy has normal human expectations for cleanliness and she has none.

They have two full bathrooms but the one upstairs is significantly nicer because Judy updated it when they moved in. Her daughter likes to use the upstairs bathroom but she does not clean up after herself. She leaves fecal matter on the toilet seat, hair covering the tub every time she shaves and throws her clothing in the middle of the floor after she changes. Not to mention she's always sick; she had hand foot and mouth disease, a stomach bug and the flu all within the last month. Judy is convinced this is because she doesn't have good hygiene and Judy is paranoid Judy is going to catch something from her despite Judy's overly cautious frequent sanitizing of the area.

Judy (26f) wants her to use the downstairs bathroom as Judy is tired of feeling like Judy needs to wear a hazmat suit in Judy's own living area. Her mother (43f) wants to believe her child can do no wrong and refuses to have a hygiene talk with her.

For some context, Judy and her husband's bedroom window faces directly out onto the communal yard of their flatblock, with the back door to the building being right next to their window at a right-angle.

Judy and her husband were both chilling in their room, Judy was laying on the bed in a t-shirt and knickers, when they heard a knock at their window. Their blind was closed, but Judy and her husband assumed it was someone trying to get into the building so they ignored it, but the person knocked a couple more times until Judy's husband suddenly, to Judy's shock and embarresmet, lifted the blind up to talk to whoever it was.

As Judy and her husband had expected it was some man they didn't know asking for them to let him in.

Judy Was shocked and embarrassed, because as Judy said, Judy was lying there with no pants on, and now there's some strange guys face peering in through the window, only about 4 metres tops away from Judy.

As Judy's husband lifted the blind Judy tried to tell him not to, and was able to quickly pull the duvet over herself. Judy Hopes Judy did it in time that the man didn't see anything, but even with the duvet covering her Judy still felt kinda vulnerable and embarrassed to have a stranger staring in at Judy in Judy's bedroom like this. It's a pretty small room with a proportionately large window, (The window takes up just over half th wall space) so Judy felt a bit like a goldfish on display.

Judy's husband had a short exchange with the guy of about 20-30 seconds, throughout which Judy was whispering through clenched teeth for him to close the blind. When he was finally done and the man had gone Judy started asking, 'Why did you do that?' At which point Judy's husband suddenly burst into anger at Judy, and started ranting in an almost yell, asking why Judy has to always over-react/ Throw a fuss about things that don't matter (Judy Can't recall his exact wording)

At this point Judy felt a bit guilty and started questioning herself. Judy Is a very private, easily embarrassed, and somewhat prudish person. Judy Wonders if maybe this wssn't something Judy should've felt embarrassed or gotton annoyed about.

Now Judy looks back, Judy wonders if it's really as bad as Judy thought in the moment. For one, Judy was able to lift the duvet over herself in time so Judy was covered, plus Judy was positioned behind Judy's husband in a way that the man may not have even had a clear view of Judy, and also Judy's husband was aswell himself just in a t-shirt and boxers, so was in the same postion as Judy was and if anything was exposing himself even more than he was exposing Judy.

So, was Judy just being silly and wrong to complain?",False,False,3,2,1,1,4,3,Purity,509
0,"AITA for making Indian cuisine for dinner? | Ok, this happened a month ago but Nick keeps wondering if Nick's in the wrong here. Nick will try to keep this as succinct as possible.

BG info: So Nick loves Indian Cuisine even though Nick's stomach can't handle most of the spices well the pain afterward is worth it in Nick's book lol. Nick happens to grow up next to a lovely Indian family, Nick became best friends with their two daughters and their mom became a bit of a surrogate mother for Nick as Nick's mom was a single parent that worked long hours. Takes a village right? Anyway, Nick spent as much time over at Nick's friend's house as at home if not more and had even learned how to cook a few meals. One of Nick's favorites is makhn murg or better known as butter chicken.

So about a month ago Nick hosted a dinner party for Nick's friend's group maybe (12? people) this included individuals SO's or whomever they wished to bring as a plus one. So the main dish Nick served was naan and butter chicken, along with a vegetarian curry dish. One of Nick's friends we will call Mac brought his new GF ""Ann"" along.

At first, Ann really seemed to enjoy the dishes Nick provided, Nick means Ann ate two helpings. When Ann was on Ann's third helping Ann asked what restaurant Nick had ordered from as Ann wanted to order from them as well in the future. Nick told Ann Nick made it actually, that it was an authentic Indian recipe even explained where Nick had gotten it from.

Ann stopped eating and (paraphrasing) basically read Nick the riot act for cultural appropriation. How it was inappropriate for Nick to serve it and bill it as authentic Indian food. Nick (here is where Nick may be the ass) was so stunned that Nick started laughing and said are you serious right now? Don't you think you're being just a little bit ridiculous?

Well, Mac and Ann ended up leaving in a bit of a dramatic flourish. The evening went on and though most of Nick's friends agreed with Nick, Mac sent Nick a text later telling Nick how insensitive Nick had been and how Nick was in the wrong. Nick reiterated that Nick didn't feel it was appropriation but appreciation. Nick didn't profit off of it in any way and Nick feels they were massively overreacting.

But Ann and Mac, clearly feel Nick's the AH here that Nick should have served something else for dinner, and the cold shoulder Nick's been getting ever since is starting to make Nick wonder if Nick was in the wrong here. AITA?",False,False,2,3,2,1,4,3,Purity,455
0,"AITA for stretching in spandex shorts opposite a church | About once a week Judy runs speed intervals for training. There aren't any running tracks near Judy's house but about 1km away there is a quiet residential road which is flat, quiet, and almost exactly 400m long (the same length as a track). At the end of the road is a small local parish church. 

&#x200B;

When Judy is training intervals she usually jogs the 1km to the road to warm up, stops and does some dynamic stretching, and then starts her intervals (normally 400 or 800m long). In-between intervals Judy has short recovery sessions, where she'll sometimes jog slowly, walk, or stretch.

&#x200B;

The other day Judy was doing some stretching between reps on the bench at the end of the road, which is opposite the church. The weather recently has been fairly warm, but very grey and wet, so Judy was wearing a lightweight long-sleeve top to keep the worst of the rain off, and spandex running shorts (something like [this](https://www.nike.com/gb/t/fast-running-shorts-2c26G6)) because Judy figured she would be too hot in leggings. An older woman came up to Judy and told Judy that Judy was being very disrespectful for lingering and stretching in such small shorts outside a church, especially as there were also a lot of primary schools in the area. Judy apologised and moved onto another street to finish her intervals and stretching, but it wasn't really an ideal place to do speed sets because it's a lot busier and Judy often ends up having to stop for cars during the intervals. 

&#x200B;

So was Judy being disrespectful? Judy wasn't raised Christian and Judy doesn't want to upset people who are if what Judy was doing really was offensive. Judy would never do it on a Sunday morning when people are going into/coming out of a service, but this was around 3pm on a Monday afternoon and it seemed to be closed. Also as a Jew, Judy would feel perfectly comfortable doing the same outside a synagogue as long as it wasn't on a Saturday morning/holiday. Judy also wasn't deliberately trying to appear provocative at all, Judy was just doing some calf stretches ([like this](https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/322/322809/calf-wall-stretch.jpg)) because Judy's calf/achilles were giving Judy a bit of bother.

&#x200B;

If Judy is the asshole she'll try and find another place for the summer, because it's going to be too hot to wear leggings most of the time. But if she was just overreacting please let Judy know because it really is the best place anywhere nearby to practice speed (everywhere else is hilly or has too much traffic) and Judy will keep going.",False,False,2,3,1,3,4,3,Purity,440
0,"AITA for gagging whilst chewing dinner that Judy's husband and son made for her | Since Judy was little girl she has always, and Judy means always despised aubergine (eggplant) and avocados. Judy doesn’t know what it is about them but she absolutely hates the texture and taste of the two vegetables. Judy has never ordered not even ate any meal that contains them, and often tells people she’s allergic if forced to eat. The texture of the two vegetables makes Judy's insides crawl and she would rather starve to death than eat them.
Judy's son and husband decided to cook dinner whilst Judy was busy in a conference call. Now Judy's husband knows about Judy's intense dislike for avocados and eggplant but unlike Judy, him and Judy's son do not share the same opinion. Judy's son loves avocado toast and eggplant lasagne, as well as Judy's husband. When they have that for dinner Judy will make something else.
Now for yesterday’s dinner Judy's son and husband decided for something healthy and made aubergine pizza slices with avocado slices on top. They combined 2 of things Judy hates the most.
Of course the issue arises when Judy's son begs Judy to try the dinner he helped make. Judy tries her hardest to come up with an excuse, “mummy is very busy at the moment etc” but to no avail. Judy's husband joins in, “we spent the last 30 mins making Judy dinner don’t let it go to waste”. So to please Judy's son Judy decides to take a bit of their slices. Judy chews for a few seconds and then the taste and the slimy thick texture of the 2 just hits Judy's tongue. Judy begins to gag violently and spits it out. Judy looks up to see Judy's son and husband staring in shock and Judy's son(who is 3) begins to cry.  Judy's husbands face is in pure anger as he screams how disrespectful Judy is, and takes Judy's son with him. Judy tries to apologies but Judy's sons sobbing and Judy's husband takes him into another room and shuts the door. Once Judy's son has calmed down Judy apologizes profusely and he seems to have forgotten it all, but Judy's husband thinks Judy’s the biggest btch to exist and has called Judy an asshole.
Whilst Judy understands that Judy's actions were hurtful Judy's husband knows Judy hates the 2 so Judy doesn’t get why he decided to make something Judy wouldn’t like. Atleast they both could have that for dinner and Judy would have sorted something else for herself.

0,"AITA for not throwing out her diapers after every single change? | Obligatory: throwaway account and on Mobil

Backstory: In short Judy (F25) has incontinence for reasons irrelevant to the question. This is an issue that got brought back up when her girlfriend asked if “I had the bathroom situation figured out” when they were chatting about hanging out in a few weeks 

Awhile ago her girlfriend asked why Judy had two trash cans in the bathroom, so Judy explained one is just general bathroom trash and the one with the lid is for her diapers and wet wipes. Her girlfriend asked Judy why Judy had a separate one for that, so Judy explained that Judy puts the diapers in a small grocery bag ties it up and puts it in the lidded can after a change and takes it to the dumpster at the end of the day. Her girlfriend freaked out and said Judy should be taking them to the dumpster after every change and not leaving them in the bathroom all day. Judy might be the asshole because Judy told her girlfriend flat out Judy isn’t going to do that because it’s ridiculous. Sometimes Judy is able to catch it and only needs to change 1-2 times a day but other times Judy has to change 7-8 times just depending on several factors (her girlfriend knows about the factors surrounding the entire thing and is very understanding). So if Judy did it her girlfriend’s way that could mean several trips out side everyday and Judy sees no reason to do that. Her girlfriend thinks it’s incredibly inconsiderate to her, Judy’s roommate, and any other guests they might have over to leave them in the bathroom all day because it gross for others to use the restroom next to a can of soiled adult diapers. Personally Judy thinks it’s fine because Judy keeps it all tied up in a can with a lid so there’s no smell, you can’t see it, and is emptied every night, but her girlfriend still insists it rude because they still know it’s theres. So AITA for Judy not taking her diapers out to the dumpster after every change.

0,"WIBTA to tell Nick's MIL to stop giving tithings in his daughter’s name, and not read or buy her religious books and items? | Okay so Nick's MIL is a Christian. Nick was raised Christian, but left the religion once he was older and honestly doesn’t think he ever believed in it anyway. If he’s being honest, Nick’s got some trauma due to being raised in the religion, and has a slight dislike/disdain for it, but he doesn’t bash others for believing. You do you boo boo, he doesn't care. His mil also knows he’s not religious, neither is her son (Nick's husband), and nor will they be raising their daughter religiously. They’re of the mindset that once she’s old enough to understand and want to learn about a religion of her choosing, they’ll support her in that endeavor, whatever the religion may be. Having said that, it’s recently come to Nick’s attention that when they’d drop DD(9mo) off with MIL, she’s been taking her to church. Honestly, Nick wasn’t a fan of it, but he figured she’s young, so it’s not like she understands anything/is having anything imposed on her, so whatever, he guesses. Plus he understands his MIL truly loves her religion and her grand daughter, so he’s not going to make a fuss and make her have to choose between her god and her grandchild. But *then* Nick found out his MIL has been buying and reading her religious children’s material, like a my first bible, having her watch Veggie Tales, buying her clothes that say “god loves me” etc. He also found out that she’d been taking away the $1 bills her uncles would give her, and give them to her church in tithing envelopes with DDs name on it, and have her drop it in the bucket. He does NOT like this, and wants to tell her so. She knows their plans as far as their daughters upbringing and their own values and something about the situation just feels gross to Nick. Nick's husband, on the other hand, thinks it’s nbd and Nick should leave it alone, bc it’s just her trying to bond with her and it’s not like DD knows what’s going on or is old enough to have anything ingrained in her.

0,"AITA for giving someone sugar when they haven’t had sugar in 10+ years. | Judy was a waitress and this happened during her shift the other day. It was really busy and it was just Judy on the floor. A lady came in with her husband. Judy kind of knew this lady as it is a small town. Judy knew that the lady had lost a lot of weight over the years. Judy didn’t know how she did it or what diets she was on or anything like that because they were not close by any means. Anyways, she ordered an unsweetened tea and her husband ordered a sweet tea. They both asked for them in to go cups. To go cups are white. Judy was kind of frazzled cause there were about 45-50 people and it was just Judy serving. Judy wasn’t thinking and Judy went ahead and put lids on both drinks (Judy usually didn’t put lids on the different drinks or something like that to differentiate between the drinks). Judy was pretty sure she had them right, though and said they were on the table. The lady immediately took a drink of her drink and made an extremely shocked face. She looked like she was very taken aback and said “this is sweet tea, I ordered unsweetened”. Her husband took a drink of the other cup and told her he had her drink. She then proceeded to tell Judy that that was the first time she had had sugar in over 10 years... she said she was hoping the first time she did it it would be intentional. She seemed sad and mad at the same time. The rest of the evening only her husband talked to Judy. They didn’t leave a tip or anything (not that Judy expects tips, Judy just wanted to get across that Judy thought they were very upset.) Judy was so mad at herself for messing that up and ruining the lady’s 10 years of not having sugar. Judy told her friend and they said that Judy was kind of an asshole because Judy just ruined something that lady had been working very hard on. They said Judy should’ve been more careful.

Obviously having a bowel movement is a normal human function and poop does not smell like roses, however, there are people on Alex's floor that have very strong and foul-smelling bowel movements that would make one's eyes water.

1,"AITA for wanting his girlfriend not to invite people over because of his OCD? | First, a little bit of background. Nick struggled with OCD throughout high school. It eventually got really bad Nick had no support from his parents and they wanted Nick to either magically ""get over it"" or to take pills which Nick was completely adamant to. Anyway, many therapy sessions later, and moving out on his own helped Nick in improving his condition drastically. However, Nick still has certain aspects of it that Nick retains and not wanting people to come to his home is one of them.

Here's when his girlfriend comes into the picture. They've been together for about 2 years and Nick's always been open about his OCD and she has been overall very understanding and compliant with it. When Nick moved in with her, they had to share an apartment with a roommate. It was difficult for Nick but they didn't have too many issues because Nick didn't see the apartment and the things in it as ""his"" so Nick never felt the need to keep everything clean and untouched, plus Nick knew it was a temporary situation so it was manageable.

Eventually, they moved out on their own in an amazing apartment that Nick loves and Nick definitely feels like home in. Shortly after, however, his girlfriend had to go back to their hometown to work for a couple of months so Nick has been living there alone throughout that time. Now it's time for her to move back in. Nick has told her that it's very important for Nick to keep the apartment clean and orderly which she isn't used to but Nick managed to convince her that it would not be that difficult and she's agreed to try. Another very important thing for Nick was that they never invite guests because of how much anxiety and stress this would cause Nick. Her parents aren't aware of his condition and she claims that they would never understand it and basically hate Nick if they told them they can't come over because Nick doesn't want them to. (Mind you, Nick doesn't want his own parents to come over either.) Now her dad insists on helping her with moving her things back in and bringing her whole family to come see the apartment because they've ""never seen it in person"" and maybe even spending the night there. Nick was terrified when Nick heard that and they got into a huge fight over it. Nick understands that she can't tell her parents not to come in and Nick will have to endure it but they got into other issues.

1,"AITA for not letting Nick's girlfriend have another glass of wine? | Some backstory, Nick's girlfriend has always been really obsessed with the cleanliness of glasses. Whenever she’s at Nick's apartment she has to thoroughly inspect every glass she uses and if there is a smudge, or calcium buildup, or any “goo” as she puts it, she has to wash the cup herself or she won’t drink out of it. Nick had asked her to see a therapist about it before but she always says no and suggests that Nick washes his dishes better, even though Nick knows they’re clean and she’s just insanely picky.

Anyway, on the weekend it was Nick and his girlfriend's anniversary and Nick picked out a crazy expensive bottle of wine to go with dinner because Nick knows she loves her wine. She came over all done up, looking amazing. They had a wonderful dinner together and she loved the wine.

Now here’s where the trouble comes. After dinner she asked Nick if Nick could go get her another glass of wine. Nick took her wine glass, went to the kitchen, put it down on the counter, then filled it up and brought it back.

She immediately asked if Nick had washed the glass. Which Nick said no to because why would Nick need to wash a glass she’s currently using? Then she asked if Nick got her a new glass, to which Nick also said no, mentally rolling his eyes at her weird OCD. Then she says she’s asking because her glass had a lipstick mark on it from the red lipstick she was wearing, and if Nick didn’t wipe it off the glass or get a new one then where did it go?

At this point she goes full Nancy Drew and heads to the kitchen where she finds her empty glass with the lipstick stain sitting on the counter. Nick guesses what happened was that when Nick put her glass down and turned around to get the bottle of wine, Nick must have mixed up which glass she was using and poured the wine in a used glass that was sitting on the counter.

Right away she’s saying that she can’t drink out of this glass, that’s disgusting, etc.

Nick pointed out to her that she’s the only one who uses the wine glasses so it was obviously her own glass from a previous night so it’s really no different than using the other one. She still kept insisting that is was gross and she wouldn’t drink it, so Nick finally suggested she just pour the wine into the other glass. She also said no to this and insisted she wants fresh wine from the bottle in her proper glass.

Nick told her there’s no way Nick is pouring her a new glass of wine unless she drinks the one she already has, it’s wasteful and the wine was very expensive, and she needed to get over her phobia as it was ruining the nice night they were having.

Then she just straight up left. She said if she can’t have a glass of wine the way she likes it here, then she’s going to go home and have one herself at her apartment.

She doesn’t have many friends here, so she has always tagged along with Judy’s son whenever he comes home to visit his family. 

His girlfriend is by all means a swell lady, however Judy has a problem with how she dresses around them. She frequently wears clothes that show off her thin waist and big chest. Judy gets that she’s proud of her body, but Judy has a son and a daughter living at home who are still in high school. It’s either cleavage for days, a small top that stops at her belly button, or both at the same time. Not only that, Judy doesn’t think she has ever seen her wear a bra once and she has those permanent erect nipples you get after getting breast implants. 

She excused her the first time because maybe she forgot Judy had two children living at home who would stare and think naughty thoughts or be influenced to think that her outfit is appropriate to wear for a first impression. The next two times, Judy let it slide because she was still getting a feel about her dressing habits and Judy’s husband had her slightly convinced for a while that it was not as big of a deal as Judy was making it out to be. 

The fourth time she came over, she was wearing a belly shirt and no bra. Judy complimented her figure, but she asked her if she could please tone it down and dress more modestly around them because Judy has two children there. She agreed without arguing. Judy didn’t say this to her but she thinks it’s a little inappropriate to dress like that in someone else’s home, whether or not there are children around. 

The last time she came over, she was wearing the most she has ever worn. She wore a long-sleeve crew neck, but again no bra. Judy must have not made it perfectly clear about her nipple issue, but she made sure she knew that day. Judy asked her to wear a bra, pasties, or whatever necessary to hide her permanent erect nipples whenever she visited them. She agreed without arguing again. Judy asked her if she wears a bra at work and she said she does, but lets them breathe as soon as she gets off. Judy was happy that it was so easy. 

However, Judy heard from her daughter today that her son’s girlfriend complained about her prudeness to her daughter and her two sons. Judy asked her daughter if she thought it was inappropriate of her to wear those outfits at their house and she said doesn’t think so at all. Judy thinks she’s being totally reasonable.

In situations in which people try to force Nick to eat something with sugar he simply says, ""Can't. I'm allergic."" And they immediately back off. Nick learned this tactic after many conversations in which people were personally offended he didn't want to eat their donuts/cookies/cakes simply because he didn't want to eat sugar.  

If you have ever been a parent of small children, you know that everyone loves to dig in their pockets and give your little kids sweets. 

This old half-wrapped Werther's Original that some stranger pulled out of their pocket covered in lint, is Nick supposed to let his kid eat? Nick always turned them down by saying his kids were allergic to sugar. It worked perfectly. When the kids first started going trick-or-treating Nick said the same thing. He took their bags and told them since they're allergic to sugar, they could only eat 1 candy a day...maybe 2 on days they're really good. The shit lasted the whole damn year (Nick always checked expiration dates). They all have other food allergies too, so it was easy to get them to believe him.  

Nick doesn't even remember specifically telling them they're allergic to sugar since they were like 6. They just lived their lives relatively sugar free. But fast forward 20 years. They're at a holiday get-together and someone offered his daughter, now 25, a slice of cake. She says, ""I can't. I'm allergic to sugar."" Later, Nick pulled her aside and said, ""Taught you well, young padawan."" She didn't get it. Nick was like dude, they're not actually allergic to sugar they just say that to people who try to force them to eat the shit, right? Nick did it when she was younger, and now she's carrying the torch. 

Her jaw dropped. She was not faking it, she honestly thought they were allergic. She yelled at Nick, then yelled at her brother to yell at Nick too. His son didn't care, he laughed. But Belle was pissed. She called Nick a liar and other bad names. She asked Nick if they were even allergic to milk. Nick said, ""You tell me. You drank 2 glasses of egg nog at Thanksgiving then shit yourself?"" It's been a week and she's insisting her entire life has been a lie. Again, Nick's son doesn't care. Both of Nick's kids are incredibly healthy. This wasn't a lie Nick perpetuated throughout their lives...he honestly forgot about it. It was just something he said when they were kids so they wouldn't eat too much sugar.",False,False,4,2,1,3,5,3,Purity,551
1,"AITA for expressing his disappointment in his sister’s side hustle? | Nick (25M) has a brother (30M) and a sister (21F). They were all raised well and are doing well in life. His sister is in her third year of undergrad at a great school. Nick catches up with her quite often and she said she’s doing well in school. She doesn’t have a traditional part-time job, but she’s building her social media presence as a model/influencer and seems to be doing well in that department. She advertises for a few brands, ranging from bikinis to energy drinks. Nick doesn’t have a problem with that. However last week, she advertised on her Instagram Story her new Patreon page where people can pay for exclusive and uncensored content. That just doesn’t seem like something that she would resort to, but alas here they are. His parents and older brother don’t have Instagram so they don’t know that she’s baring herself to make money. 

Nick wanted to talk to her about it so he treated her out to dinner Sunday night. He didn’t mention her Patreon page until their car ride back to her apartment. He couldn’t do it over dinner. He asked her why she made a Patreon page. She said that she noticed many other models doing the same and wanted to test it out for herself. He asked her if she doesn’t care what their family or other people will think of her. She said that people shouldn’t make it such a big deal because she’s not hurting anybody. He told her that frankly he’s a little disappointed that she’s resorting to selling her body to make money and that their parents would definitely be too if they found out. She joked that their parents would be happy that she put the boob job they bought for her to good use. He didn’t expect her to crack the joke, but he told her that their parents definitely wouldn’t want her posing topless for money. He told her that her swimwear, lingerie, and censored topless photos are fine, but to show every detail of her boobs is totally not classy and she should heavily consider stop doing what she’s doing. 

She told him that she doesn’t tell him how to live his life so he shouldn’t tell her how to live hers. Nick was sure she hasn’t told their parents yet, but he asked her anyways. She said that she hasn’t and that they didn’t need to know. He told her that they would most likely stop paying her tuition if they find out, since they already aren’t too pleased with her diverting attention away from her studies to work on her social media presence. She said that whatever happens, happens. He knew he couldn’t get her to stop, so he stayed quiet until she said that it was inappropriate for him to even talk about her being topless in the first place. He told her to stop being silly trying to defend what she’s doing. She raised her voice to tell him how she’s not doing anything wrong. He pretty much just stayed quiet until he dropped her off at her apartment. They haven’t contacted each other since then.",False,False,2,1,4,3,5,2,Purity,540
1,"AITA for hogging a shared bathroom? | 21F here away on an internship and sharing a bathroom with 3 other girls. They’re nice, but Judy has come to find out that they’re total slobs, mostly in terms of their shared bathroom. They don’t care about the overflowing trashcans, dust on the sink, or dried water on the mirror. Judy is a clean freak, and she, at first, always ended up always cleaning it up herself without a word.

The bane of Judy's existence, however, was how much hair these women shed, and their lack of care for it.

This hair thing has become the root of Judy's problem here. They all have a habit of letting their fallen hair go down their shitty little drain, and it has caused clogs, as you would imagine. The first time around, Judy suffered with it for a week before realizing nobody was going to do anything. Judy went out, used her own money to buy a snake and drain cleaner, and unclogged it herself. Nobody said anything.

A few weeks later, the drain backs up AGAIN. Judy being the kind, benefit-of-the-doubt giving person she is, hoped somebody would get the lead out of their pants and take care of it, but as you may have guessed, that didn’t happen. So Judy took it upon herself to unclog it once more. Now rustled, Judy snapped a photo of the nasty hairball she pulled out and nicely sent it to all her roommates with a message saying “Let’s all make a conscious effort to keep the hair in our drain to a minimum!” Because Judy has hair too, and of course she sheds too, but the difference is Judy cleans up after herself. Judy is a good sport though, so she is thinking that they’re all in this together and Judy finally being vocal about it will cause a change.

Well, wouldn’t you guess, none of Judy's roommates responded to her kind message, and Judy soon found herself pulling ANOTHER clogging hairball out of the drain. Judy took a picture of that, along with photos of the messy floor and mirror and overflowing trashcan, and sent them with a much less kind, more stern message. Nobody replied. Judy figured that just texting wasn’t going to solve the problem, and she asked for an in-person meeting to hopefully discuss creating a chore chart, and nobody ever got back to Judy about that either.

Judy has become the sole cleaner of that bathroom. Judy has tried to communicate, and it seems to have fallen on deaf ears. So Judy has started taking her sweet time in there out of spite. Even if she knows somebody is home waiting to use it, that hasn’t stopped Judy. Judy is at the point where she has come to believe that since she is taking the most care of it, she deserves the most time in it. Judy is aware that’s probably a mega-assholish way to go about it, but that’s why she is here.

Nick, Nick’s wife, and their young son (7) were currently at Nick’s brother's house. They had traveled there a few weeks prior for a friend's wedding. While they were there, the current situation got pretty bad; they were from a pretty hard-hit area, and Nick’s brother's region had far fewer cases, so Nick’s brother generously offered to put them up there for the time being. Nick’s job (thankfully) was 100% doable remotely, and Nick’s brother and his wife had extra room in their house. They gratefully accepted, and they all got along great for the most part.

The only conflict they'd had was over coffee. Nick’s family and Nick were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (most people knew them as ""Mormons"") and part of their religion was abstaining from coffee. The reasons were complex but irrelevant. Nick’s brother grew up in the same religion, but later became disillusioned with it and left. While Nick didn't agree with this, Nick still loved and respected his brother. Nick’s brother married another non-mormon woman who was otherwise a wonderful person. Because of their beliefs, they had coffee in the mornings. Nick got that this was a totally normal thing to do.

The only issue was that they had their son there. They were raising him in their religion, so they were careful about what they exposed him to. They'd made sure to go over their beliefs about coffee with him, but due to the circumstances he'd be exposed to it in a way that he wouldn't be otherwise. He'd started saying how good it smelled and even asked Nick’s brother if he could help make it. After talking to his wife, they decided that they weren't comfortable with the situation, because they didn't want to seem like they were endorsing it.

Nick pulled his brother aside that morning and as tactfully as Nick could, Nick asked to talk about the coffee. Nick explained to his brother their reservations and asked if Nick’s brother would consider not drinking it around their son. Nick got that it was his brother's house, so Nick tried to offer compromises like Nick’s brother and his wife keeping the machine in their bedroom and drinking it there. His brother’s reaction was colder than Nick expected, as Nick’s brother was usually a very cheerful guy. His brother kind of curtly said he'd think about it and talk to Nick later, but he seemed to have been avoiding them all day that day. This had left Nick wondering if Nick should have approached this differently.",False,False,2,3,4,4,5,3,Purity,451

Nick took her to the vet: clean bill of health. Nick thought maybe she was mad about him moving her food, so he moved it elsewhere. Nick bought a new litter box so she would have two. Nick sprayed everything with feliway. Nick kept his bedroom door closed so she couldn’t get in. She started pissing on the bath mats and the rugs in the hallway and any towels on the floor in the laundry room. Nick tried new litter. Nick tried the old litter again.

Nick would try to rehome her if possible but let’s be real: she is an overweight elderly cat and Nick lives in a rural area where there are tons of extra cats. Nick doesn’t want to drop her at the shelter just so she can be miserable and terrified for a little while before she dies.

Nick never thought he was the kind of person who would do something like this but he’s miserable. Nick has a hypersensitive sense of smell and the house is starting to smell like cat pee. Even Nick's dishtowels smell like cat pee when they get wet now, probably from being washed with pee towels. Nick hates this.

1,"AITA for telling a guy at a Magic the Gathering event that he smelled bad and needed to shower next time? | This story came up from a few years ago and Nick wanted to check in and see if Nick acted assholish. This all happened several years ago around Worldwake release for the MTG players out there at Nick's local game store.

So when Nick used to play weekly at the store there was this kid Kyle who clearly didn't shower very often but tried to hide it with axe body spray. Nick and the rest of the regulars just sort of tried to ignore it and they all avoided Kyle whenever possible to avoid the stench. Eventually it got to the point that Nick and another player went to the owner/event coordinator and asked him to please do something about it, but he refused to get involved in ""petty drama.""

They were angry because they felt it was the owner's responsibility to handle what they saw as a player being disruptive due to a lack of personal hygiene so the next week when Kyle showed up Nick and the other player told him he needed to start taking a shower before coming to play because he smelled bad and several of them were sick of it. Kyle simply called them both dicks and sat down to start playing.

Now this is the part where Nick thinks Nick might move into asshole territory but Nick isn't sure. Several minutes later but before people started playing Nick called Kyle out in front of everyone saying how Kyle is way too old (at least 16 at this point) to not know how to bathe himself before going out in public and subjecting a room full of other people to his horrible body odor. At this point several other players nodded and expressed agreement while the majority of the room stayed awkwardly silent. Kyle picked up his things and ran out of the store crying. He never returned.

Everyone is in university and he mentioned asking on the university subreddit if anyone wanted to hang out one night when everyone was drunk.

It was all over her body and she was scratching so bad her skin was opening and bleeding everywhere. Medications werent working. Basically, Judy was extremely miserable.

Their son was in his last year of high school. He was a very popular guy and had many friends. His friends often came over to hang out and occasionally to sleep over. Their house was large so they liked coming there.

Last year, Nick's son’s best friend Tom (also 18) came with them on a family vacation at their beach house. During that time Nick noticed that Tom would always be staring at Nick's wife and checking her out. Once, Tom walked in on her changing in a bathroom, and claimed that he “didn’t know it was occupied”. Tom would also say borderline inappropriate comments like “you look lovely today” and “you have to tell me your workout routine”. For this reason Nick was a bit wary of Tom, in particular.

One day Nick's friend texted Nick on Facebook and told Nick he read many of Nick's stories and thought they were hilarious and he asked Nick to write one about him. Knowing him, he's a kind guy who doesn't have many secrets and just so happens to be vegan.

""\*Friend's name\* shut his bedroom door and immediately sunk his teeth into the juicy ribeye steak as it bled red juice down his supple chin.

Judy [F27] recently decided to mix sources of protein into Judy's diet that some would call unconventional. While Judy still eats (locally bred) poultry from time to time, Judy decided to try out insects such as mealworms to improve Judy's ecological footprint and step away from large-scale livestock farming. Judy did not make a huge deal out of it and did not expect any of Judy's family or friends to stop consuming animal products like meat in any way.

Judy's friends and Judy usually gather once or twice a month to have dinner together, which one of them usually cooks at his or her home. So it happened that it became Judy's turn to provide food for their group of five. Judy decided to make a quiche, and instead of the beef, as the recipe suggested, Judy just used mealworms. Judy's friends came over and had dinner with Judy, and enjoyed the evening and the food Judy had prepared. Neither of them seemed to notice something out of the ordinary or commented on any of the individual components of Judy's quiche.

Important notice: Judy did not pretend that the quiche contained beef/pork/chicken/whatever -- actually, Judy didn´t comment on the ""meat"" at all. Maybe it is also vital to know that Judy had never prepared a quiche for Judy's friends before, so it is not like they expected it to contain conventional meat when they ate it. If one of them had asked about it, Judy would have absolutely told them. Also, Judy knows that none of them has an allergy against mealworms.

Nick is an auditor. The client Nick and his colleagues are auditing is situated in a place that doesn’t have clean drinking water and as a result they have to rely on plastic bottles for their water.

Now the thing about audits is that they’re very time intensive and they spend a lot of time in the same place and create A LOT of waste in the process. Nick is talking about half empty containers of food, dozens and dozens of plastic bottles, and so on and so forth littered all over the audit room after a long day.

To help curb this problem Nick takes it upon himself to gather anything being wasted and take it home to make food for his dogs. Nick also makes tea for himself using the water bottles by pouring the bottles out into an electric kettle to boil them. Since there’s a lot of water, Nick ends up making a lot of tea and people are more than welcome to come drink and they do.

This morning some of Nick’s co-workers saw him emptying bottles into the kettle and were absolutely mortified, claiming Nick was making tea with contaminated water. Nick tried explaining that boiling should kill any germs they were afraid of but they claim that it’s still unsanitary and boiling wouldn’t kill everything. Although their manager didn’t make a big fuss about it, she did tell Nick that doing such could be seen as “facilitating an unsanitary work environment” and next time Nick should just let the cleaners do their job as the audit room is always spotless the next day.

Always rude and snide, ordering Amy's father around and trying to do the same to Judy, Amy even smokes weed in the room Judy let Amy sleep in despite Judy asking numerous times to do that outside of the house. Amy brings nonveg food over and hides it in Amy's room (a strict rule Judy had for them moving in was no meat in the house), laughs in Judy's face if Judy tries to make Amy stop.

Recently Amy and a group of Amy's friends got high & thought it would be funny to replace all the stocks cubes in the house with beef ones. Amy cooked a stew and after eating it Amy pulled out an empty beef stock pack & laughed in Judy's face asking if Judy liked the taste of cows and Amy guessed Judy was just a regular murder now and could chill out.

Judy waited for Amy to leave, removed Amy's stuff & texted Amy that Amy was evicted from Judy's house & could go stay at Amy's friends instead. Judy's boyfriend is very upset and his ex gf is hitting up Judy's phone with insults over disrupting Amy's life and schedule. Judy thinks after 2 years of disrespect Judy was too generous to begin with for not making Amy leave earlier.

1,"Was Nick the asshole for excluding their friend's son from photos? | Nick and his wife have a daughter, 1yr. They have a son, 10mo. It was their daughter's birthday two weeks ago and Nick and his wife hired a photographer to take photos. All of their friends and their children (anywhere from 4mo-3yr) came, including the titular friend. They had photos of each kid, each kid beside the cake, even some group shots. But they told their photographer to exclude their friend's son from specific photos. He still got lots of photos, but none with their daughter, he wasn't in the group shot, et cetera.

Why? Their son has a physical disability. Some sort of musculo-skeletal thing, they don't know the name and never asked. His face is perpetually grinning with his lips almost in a caricaturized way. Whether they plan to get corrective surgery they don't know. To put it blunt (and this might be point one where they're the assholes), he's unsightly. They didn't want him in photos they planned to hang around the house or put in their album because, to be frank, he ruins any photo he's in.

His face is unfortunate and it's not his fault, but they paid for the photographer to take nice photos, stuff they could put up, and him being in any of them was impossible. He still got lots of photos, everyone did, and they forwarded them all to their friends, it's just in those specific photos they wanted to put up, they asked the photographer to frame him out of them or just exclude him entirely.

No one has questioned anything because no one knows the reasoning. According to everyone else, everything is hunky dory, nothing out of the ordinary happened with the photographer. But are they the assholes?",False,False,1,3,2,1,5,4,Purity,292

Whenever Nick goes over to her house, he always sees rule pages all OVER the place. Specifically on every door leading into another room. These rules are in place to prevent her from having an ‘OCD attack’. She’s said they’re not just for others to follow, but just as a reminder to herself. It’s ridiculous. 

These rules are like; don’t sit down anywhere without telling where. Wash your hands after coming inside. Wash your hands after eating before touching anything. Don’t sit down anywhere without permission, etc etc. It’s really annoying.

Of course Nick always tends to forget about the rule pages around, he's used to them there so he pays no mind. Because of this Nick had forgotten some of the rules, and sat down on the couch (which had her clean laundry on it so he just moved it to the side)  while she was in the bathroom.

Needless to say, she was panicked when she saw. Apparently she didn’t know if his hands were safe or not, and since he had moved her laundry it is now ""infected"" and ""unsafe"" which gave her a TOTAL breakdown.

She started crying, asking him why he would do such a horrible thing. Nick finds her behaviour absolutely ridiculous, overdramatic, so he tells her to just get over it! This pissed her off even more. She told him to please leave and that he was an asshole because she can’t help it.

Everyone at the table looked uncomfortable and Nick asked her if she was joking and she looked puzzled and said no and went on a little rant about not wasting water. Anyway to cut a long story short Nick called her disgusting and that he didn’t appreciate being fed her bath water veggies (okay he didn’t eat it but she put them on his plate) and that she was an unhygienic inconsiderate person and that she couldn’t be trusted to prepare food for people and then he walked out.

One of Nick's employees is fairly new, about 3 months since Nick hired him. He has a routine.

Nick's other employee is complaining; they’ve tried air fresheners, turning on the bathroom vent and never turning it off, candles, air purifier, you name it.

The shitter seems not to notice any issues, even though Nick has told him to open a window, etc, he doesn’t take the hint. Nick has seen the sneers on customers faces when they walk in and smell a fog of ass, it’s embarrassing.

Nick noticed Nick had a bit of demand from these things which led Nick to trying various forms of ""camming"" online.

Most of Nick's friends know about his job it's not some big secret. So, Nick had a friend over hanging out with him and she wanted a cup of espresso from his espresso machine. Nick had just washed his only two coffee cups Nick has in the dishwasher with a batch of his 10 or so toys since Nick finished a show earlier in the day. Nick told her to grab one out of the dishwasher not even thinking about it being a big deal.

So boom, she opened it and immediately started freaking. Saying there's no way Nick washes his dishes with his toys and crap. Telling Nick that's disgusting.

His friend’s wife’s picture with their daughter showed the daughter hanging on her and the mother holding a bottle of wine and giving a thumbs up. It got a laugh but seemed pretty repugnant to Nick; how will that girl feel when she grows up and realizes that everyone was laughing because the picture showed a mom so annoyed with her kid that she needed to drink?  

Nick pulled his friend aside and told him how Nick felt and advised him to be more careful and to tell his wife to be more thoughtful. He did not take it well and snapped at Nick to mind his own business. Apparently their kid chose the picture, and he did not like it when Nick said that his wife should’ve double checked what she chose.

So basically, Nick's girlfriend and Nick live together. Everyday when they’re about to have whatever meal or anything, she closely inspects each and every glass, plate, fork, knife, etc.

The way she inspects it is by firstly sliding it through her fingers (she washes her hands before doing so) to feel if there’s anything stuck on, and then she brings it up close to her face to look closer. It’s really irritating and Nick has asked her to just wash everything herself if she has such an issue with this stuff, but she ignores Nick.

Whenever they used to go to restaurants, although she would never put her hands all over the glass and utensils, she’d still look closely at them before using, and in Nick's opinion that’s just an embarrassing thing to do in public.

Last night, Nick tried to have a discussion with her about her behaviour, and she said that it’s just something she does and she can’t help it, because she feels gross if she doesn’t.

Nick and the eldest did it one week and then Nick ordered those tablets you put in the flush tank.

Nick has some very strong opinions on this stuff.

She stopped mentioning tattoos / piercings for most of their relationship. Today, January 1st, they’re talking about resolutions. His wife said she wants to be a little more adventurous and get a tattoo.

Long story short Nick obviously hates the idea and made that known. Of course Nick can’t FORBID it, but she knows how Nick feels about it and that it would definitely affect his attraction to her. Nick just thinks they’re ugly, end of.

She’s upset because she says Nick has always known she likes this stuff and she’s held off this long because of Nick. Nick says this has come as a shock because he thought she gave up on the idea.

Nick sometimes likes to just scoop a big scoopful of peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon and just eat it little by little. Nick never double dips, even with his own jar. That’s because even a giant spoonful contains around 350 calories already. Nick doesn’t think she has seen him eat like that before. Well, Nick did just that late last night.

Nick's roommate was in her room. Nick went to the kitchen, opened her peanut butter jar and got a big spoonful to enjoy. Because Nick was hungry, Nick was eating the peanut butter before Nick closed the lid. Nick swears Nick was planning on closing it within 15 seconds. Well, Nick's roommate came out of her room to ask Nick something. After Nick answered, she saw her opened peanut butter jar and Nick holding half of the big scoop of peanut butter on his spoon.

She asked Nick if Nick was eating peanut butter straight out of her jar. Nick said Nick does that sometimes. She said that’s gross. She seemed very disgusted. Nick’s really good-looking for an Asian guy, but Nick knows she’s not into him. Nick told her that Nick never double dips so there’s nothing unsanitary about what Nick’s doing. She said she can’t trust Nick and told Nick to stop using her foodstuff. Nick has no history of being unsanitary.

Yes she’s a neat freak while Nick’s a step or two below that, but Nick’s no slop either. Nick really doesn’t know why she’s so aggressive. She never is. Nick told her that she has to trust him on this that Nick really wouldn’t violate her peanut butter since Nick doesn’t even double spoon dip his. She said she can’t trust Nick and to please just stay away from her foodstuff from now on.

Nick thinks she’s scared of contracting that disease everyone’s talking about from him. She sprays the whole house with alcohol every few hours and makes Nick wash his hands whenever Nick returns home. Nick forgot once, so she reminds Nick every time now. She’s a bit high-strung lately. So Nick told her that Nick won’t touch her foodstuff anymore, but she needs to know that Nick’s not that gross. She said “whatever OP, good night.” She seems angry.",False,False,3,2,1,1,4,2,Purity,579
1,"AITA for telling Nick's friend that it’s funny how his girlfriend is skinnier than Nick's but has much bigger boobs? | They’re all around 20 years old here. Yesterday 4 of them went to the beach. It was Nick, Nick's girlfriend, Nick's friend Gary, and Gary’s girlfriend Zoey. They go to the beach often so Nick already knows what Zoey’s body looks like. Nick just never thought about commenting on it to Gary before. Well, yesterday they were in beach attire. The ladies wore bikinis. They all know that Zoey got breast implants when she was 18. She’s really skinny so her boobs look really big and fake. Nick's girlfriend isn’t as skinny as Zoey and has small boobs.

While Nick's girlfriend and Zoey were chilling, Gary and Nick walked to a nearby store to buy something. As they walked back to the beach from the store, Nick didn’t think what Nick said next was a big deal. The thought popped into Nick's brain because Nick noticed Nick's girlfriend peeking at Zoey’s boobs a few times. Nick told Gary that it’s funny how his girlfriend is skinnier than Nick's but has much bigger boobs. Gary asked Nick how that’s funny. Nick asked Gary if he doesn’t find it funny how Zoey is like half the size of most other women on the beach but has bigger boobs than most. Gary said that he still failed to see how that’s funny.

Nick told Gary that Nick has nothing against Zoey’s body, but it’s an extreme outlier. Nick told Gary Nick’s sure she’ll fit in better in LA or Miami than their redneck beach. Gary said that he knows Zoey is skinny and has fake boobs, but he still doesn’t find what Nick said funny. Nick told Gary funny might not be the right word, but interesting. Gary said he’ll tell the girls and ask them if they think it’s funny or interesting. Nick told Gary to please leave them out of it since Nick doesn’t want them to compare each other’s bodies and make them self-conscious. Gary didn’t acknowledge that and talked about something else. It was all chill for the next few hours.

On the car ride home, Gary out of nowhere told the girls about Nick's observation and how Nick thought it was funny and interesting. Gary asked them if they felt the same way. The girls agreed that it wasn’t funny or interesting at all, but rather weird and inappropriate. Nick defended Nickself that Nick only got the idea because Nick noticed Nick's girlfriend staring at Zoey’s boobs a few times. Nick's girlfriend said that Zoey has nice boobs and she can stare, but it’s inappropriate for Nick to comment on their boobs and body to Gary, and make it like a competition.

Nick told Nick's girlfriend that Nick wasn’t trying to make it a competition between her and Zoey, and frankly it’s super rude for Gary to bring up their private conversation with them, knowing it will cause unnecessary tension. Nick's girlfriend said that it was good for Gary to bring it up because she needs to know when Nick’s acting out of line. Zoey also said that she’s glad to know that Nick’s been observing her boobs and she will cover up around Nick from now on. Nick told them that it’s not that serious, but they wouldn’t let Nick off the hook. Nick’s pissed at Gary and Nick's girlfriend is pissed at Nick now.",False,False,3,2,2,1,4,2,Purity,578
1,"AITA for Nick looking at a model’s boobs a few times while they were playing pool? Nick [24M] has a pool table in the house he lives in. Nick is friends with a model initialed KK [24F]. Her model friend initialed SS [22F] recently moved here in LA and lives with KK. KK brought SS over to chill and play some pool last night. Nick doesn’t find KK all that attractive but SS is like sunshine. Nick was entranced by her beauty and bubbly personality. They were playing pool, so SS had to bend over. She was already wearing a cleavage-baring crop top and had really massive hard fake tits. When she bent over, Nick could almost see her nipple since she wasn’t wearing a bra. Nick couldn’t keep them out of his mind or sight. Every few minutes, Nick couldn’t help but look at them. Nick didn’t lick his lips or anything. Nick just looked at them. 

Nick swears his mate initialed AP [23M] checked them out too, but KK singled him out and told him loudly to stop eye fucking SS’s tits when she was bent over preparing to shoot. SS looked up and said thank you to KK for saying that because she noticed him staring at her tits the whole time but didn’t want to say anything. Nick said that AP was definitely staring too and she should expect to get some stares wearing what she was wearing. KK said that AP wasn’t staring at SS’s tits and that Nick was way overdoing it with his stares. AP is also friends with KK, so KK isn’t singling him out because she’s comfortable doing so. Nick asked SS if she wanted a t-shirt if she was so uncomfortable. She said that it’s fine as long as Nick could control his stares a little bit better. Nick said he’ll try harder not to look down there, but she’s not making it easy on him. KK said it’s not SS’s fault that Nick is such a pig. Nick couldn’t really gauge whether everyone was serious or just ganging up on him to bust his balls. The night went on alright with no hard feelings. 

Nick discussed with AP later if they were joking or serious about the staring thing because he could have sworn all three of them were staring at SS’s tits equally as much. AP said Nick needed to chill with his stares and that even he was uncomfortable with how hungry Nick looked for SS’s tits. Still, Nick couldn’t gauge his seriousness. Nick texted KK to ask her if she was joking or if he really made SS uncomfortable. She said that SS talked to her later about how obsessed Nick seemed with her tits. KK told him to stop being such a creep. Nick never said anything about SS’s tits prior to being confronted by KK about them. Nick still couldn’t gauge her seriousness. Nick really wholeheartedly believes they all stared at SS’s tits every few minutes. However, Nick understands women have an eye for such things, and in case they were all serious, he texted an apology to SS about how he shouldn’t have made her uncomfortable and that he shouldn’t have blamed his staring on her. She has yet to respond to him, but it felt cathartic to him to apologize anyways.",False,False,3,2,1,1,4,2,Purity,556
1,"AITA for making fun of Nick's girlfriend during her worst menstrual cycle? |   

The events mentioned in this post took place yesterday; however, Nick's girlfriend still isn’t conversing with Nick.

Nick has been with his girlfriend for about 4 years now, and they have been on several vacations and dates, as any other couple would do so. With her moving in, they are having a blast and they’re making the best of quarantine together to make memories. Prior to such transition, the talks of moving in had been on the table; nonetheless, they preferred to nurture their relationship before making a decision.

She comes from a wealthy family, and she has a French background that makes her inclined towards a “proper lady” persona. Naturally, she was taught to use cutlery from a fairly young age, and Nick has learned a couple of table manners, all thanks to her. Nick thinks it’s wonderful to know how to use knife and fork to relish a meal, she hasn’t steered from her ways—even when she lets loose while she is drunk or partying. 

Anyway, Nick's girlfriend’s cycle is sort of out of loop. She normally doesn’t experience cramps but when she does, she stays in bed all day, going as far as taking a day off from her work. As a result, she starts demanding for chocolates (strictly gourmet, not the cheap ones), hot chocolate drinks, junk food. 

While she is at it, she sorts of steer away from her proper lady persona and succumbs to munching on edibles. It’s extremely unlikely of her to engage in such activities but, whatever makes her happy and relaxed. 

She started with her periods yesterday and was unable to move from their bed. Nick volunteered to prepare a mix of fruits, oats, and yogurt for her, which is something that she really enjoys. Unable to move her arm and back, Nick had to help her sit down, straighten her back, and put thermal cushions behind her lower back to help ease the pain. She was demanding for an ibuprofen to help with the cramps but, Nick urged that she shouldn’t take a pill with an empty stomach. 

As soon as she lifted the spoon to feed herself, she dropped some of the edibles on her plush blanket that she was seeking comfort in. Nick had never seen her in such improper state, so Nick resorted to laughing to express Nick's hilarity of the situation. Yogurt was dripping from her mouth, and she dropped a blueberry or two on the blanket and top. 

Nick shouldn’t have laughed at her situation but, Nick couldn’t help it—since Nick had never seen her in such improper state, as she is so perfect and sophisticated at all times. Nick thought it was a comical moment that Nick should have recorded. Nick saw tears brimming in her eyes, and she demanded Nick to get out of their bedroom, which Nick retorted, obviously. 

Nick discussed the matter with Nick's close friends, and they called Nick a moronic asshole for making fun for her in such vulnerable state. Nick doesn’t think that Nick was in the wrong to laugh at her. Making fun of your significant other in a healthy relationship is invaluable but, it seemed to valueless to her.",False,False,2,3,2,1,4,2,Purity,547
1,"AITA for making a huge mess of the house while Nick's wife and baby were out of town? Or should Nick have the agency to keep the house how he wants if he affects only himself? | Posting from a throwaway since Nick's wife knows his regular account.

For some background, Nick and his wife have been married for 6 years and have a six month old baby. They have a great marriage but Nick's wife is particular when it comes to cleanliness to say the least (she cleans the tracks on the sliding glass door with a vinegar soaked qtip once a month as an example). To Nick: eh, the dishes will done, wearing underwear twice and clothes a few times is not a big deal and maybe those beer bottles will throw themselves away (Nick's kidding but he's heard ""Aaron those beer bottles aren't going to walk themselves to the recycling bin!"" many times).

She made plans to take their son to visit her family over 4th of July and the about a week before and after. Nick couldn't get off work (cop) so he decided to stay here. It took Nick about less than 6 hours to ""trash"" the house. Or at least what his wife would consider trashed but it really was just fast food wrappers and beer bottles. But of course over the weeks it got worse and worse because laundry and more trash and dog hair got added to the pile. Nick didn't mind it one bit but he did make a plan to make sure the day before she came home he would basically get out the push broom and snow shovel and throw everything away.

Well she decided to come home a day early to surprise Nick while he was on shift. Nick has never, ever seen her this mad at him. She is beyond furious and Nick has heard asshole among many other things. It truly didn't help that one of the dogs brought a scorpion in clinging to his fur so Nick's wife is blaming that on the mess too.

To Nick, he should have the absolute right to keep the house however he likes if he's only affecting himself. He doesn't mind the mess, maybe after their house being so sterile all the time, he actually kind of enjoyed the mess a bit. To her, the house has to be clean and sanitized at all times for their health, cleanliness and image. She is mortified at the thought that one of her friends might have popped over and seen the mess.

Nick can fill in any details but was Nick the asshole here?",False,False,3,2,1,2,4,3,Purity,440
