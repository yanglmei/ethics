0,"AITA for kicking out an autistic kid from Nick's movie theater? | This one is a little interesting

A little backstory first.

Nick is a manager (m 19) at a movie theater, in a rougher part of a major Canadian city.

While cleaning a theater to prepare it for the next showing, a 16 year old looking kid came into the theater trying to find his hat. No problem, stuff gets lost all the time, and Nick knows exactly where to look; (stuff almost always finds its way under the seats). The whole time they were looking, he was cussing under his breath, ""son of a bitch"" ""fuck me,"" to Nick it seemed a little excessive but Nick understands people get frustrated when they lose things. Nick would expect this reaction if someone had lost their phone, but he had only lost his hat. Anyways Nick finds his hat (under the seat), he takes it, says thanks, and goes on his way. The hat was a black hat with a Dos Equis logo on it. After he leaves, Nick thinks to himself ""wow that interaction was weird,"" and goes on with his day without thinking anything of it. 

fast forward about an hour

Nick was at box office when a guest informed him there was a disturbance by the vending machines. Nick thanks her for informing him and starts heading over there. Immediately Nick sees a man throwing punches at another individual. Nick intervenes and tells the man to leave now. He turns around (he appears to be a teenager) and very smugly chuckles and says ""oh thats my mom."" Nick says ""doesnt matter, you need to leave now."" To Nick it seemed like he thought he could get away with doing whatever he wanted to his mom, judging on his response. regardless, Nick was going to kick him out no matter what his response was. He requested to leave out of the front doors, which Nick thought was an odd request considering what had just happened. Nick said no and escorted him out of the side doors. He kicks the door on the way out.

Nick goes to check up on the mom, she is okay but has tears in her eyes. Behind her is her younger son who was holding onto his eye and crying (he had gotten a black eye from his older brother). Nick asks if she is okay, she says yes, she says that her son is autistic and is 16 but has the mental capacity of an 8 year old. That explains it. She was completely silent from when Nick approached the situation, until Nick asked if she was okay, she had not said anything while Nick was kicking the kid out. Regardless, they give her a refund, a few passes and send her on her way (this took about 10 minutes from the time Nick asked her if she was okay). Nick apologized for kicking him out, saying that when Nick saw violence Nick had to act. She says not to worry.

After a few minutes Nick realized the kid was the same kid who lost his hat (Nick had recognized the hat). this explained his behavior to Nick. 

Fast forward about an hour, Nick was coming back from break.

As Nick walks in the doors, a fellow manager says to Nick that the cops are here, looking for someone. (he shows Nick a picture of the individual). its the kid. fuck. 

Nick goes up to the cops, they asked for Nick's story, Nick told them Nick saw someone throwing punches and kicked him out. They said he was autistic. Nick told them the mom told Nick until thereafter. They said not to worry, but that he had gone missing. 

Turns out that when Nick kicked him out he kinda just kept walking instead of waiting for his mom or whatever, and again, this is in a rough neighborhood. 

So is Nick an asshole for kicking out an autistic kid, leading to him going missing? Nick feels like perhaps Nick should have waited and asked the mom before kicking him out, but she never said anything while Nick was doing it. Nick has no idea what happened to this kid, and Nick feels really bad that Nick's actions led him to going missing. Then again, Nick also feels justified in this situation because the dude was beating the shit out of his family, what else could Nick have done.

0,"AITA for taking the belongings of a couple homeless men? | Backstory is a must so please hear Nick out. Nick works for a commercial real-estate company in Milwaukee as a maintenance man. He handles over 3 million square feet of property (mostly very old) along with his supervisor. One of their buildings has recently become vacant due to the previous tenant moving. Over the past few months they have had serious criminal damage done to the property resulting in a lot of calls to the local PD and beefed up security (cameras and barbed wire fence).

About 2 weeks ago Nick made his bi-weekly lap around the building looking for more damage and checking cameras. To his delight he found nothing, at first. As he got to the back of the building where the railroad is, he noticed a lot of new garbage. Mostly cheap beer and liquor bottles along with McDonald's wrappers flying around. He walked to where one of the service doors was spray painted and found a pile of blankets and more garbage.

It took Nick a second but he realized there was a person under the blanket. He woke the guy up and asked him if everything was alright. The man went on to say he was just trying to stay warm from the winter weather pushing in and he thought this spot was well enough out of the way as to not be bothered. Nick said not a problem, just so long as he cleaned up the garbage Nick was fine with him staying there. Nick told him about the kids tearing the place apart and advised him not to stick around during the day, less the police or Nick's boss found someone at ""the scene of the crime"" so to speak. The man said no worries he would clean up and be on his way. Nick thought nothing more of it and went about his day.

A week later Nick did his walkthrough and what did he find but the same garbage, plus more, and someone else sleeping in the same spot. He woke the new man up and asked about the beer cans scattered around. The man said none of it was his even though Nick saw amongst his belongings were 3 more unopened beers of the same type. Slightly annoyed, Nick explained to this man the exact same thing he had told the other man. The man could stay, please clean up. The man said no problem he would do it before he left. Nick said thank you, and asked him if he knew the other guy that slept there. The man nodded and Nick asked him to remind him about cleaning up.

Two days later Nick came back to more garbage. Now Nick was upset. When their buildings accrue an excess of garbage the city will give them a warning and then begin to fine them. He found the second guy and gave him one last chance. Nick told him to clean up or next time he was going to have to involve the police. He found the first guy sleeping under a loading dock and explained the same. Nick told both of them he didn't want to call the police but he couldn't just let them continue to stay there making a mess. Going on to state how if Nick's boss found out he was giving them a second chance let alone a third, how Nick would be fired. Again they agreed to clean up, so Nick left.

That day Nick found neither of them, but the garbage and their personal items were still there. So as promised he called the non-emergency number and explained to the officers the situation. He asked them if there was anything they could do and they said it was out of their hands unless damage was being done. They told Nick that he was allowed to remove the garbage/items. Nick waited around the building for an hour hoping to spot one of the homeless men, but nothing. It was at that point Nick made the decision to move all of the stuff inside their building. He came back to that building 3 more times throughout the day hoping to find one of them and return the items on the condition they didn't come back.

Nick didn't see either of them, however their items were safe and he did plan on returning them first thing in the morning. Nick felt terrible for taking their things but he couldn't risk his job. Especially after he gave them several chances and was very polite and sympathetic. AITA for taking their things?",FALSE,FALSE,4,3,2,5,2,4,Authority,755
0,"AITA for not letting Nick 's stepson 's mother see him while her husband is out of town? |
Nick 's husband was married before her. His ex-wife announced to him that she had been having an affair and was running off with the guy. She signed away her rights to their kid (7 at the time) and basically said she didn 't want to see either of them again. Nick and her husband started dating after that and got married. It 's been nearly 5 years and they haven 't heard from her.

Nick 's husband and Nick talked about her a little bit when they first got married. He said he didn 't really think they 'd ever see her again, but at the time he was pretty angry with her for what she 'd done to their son, so he said if they ever did see her, he didn 't want to see her. But again, that was about 4 years ago when it was still pretty fresh. He said he wasn 't mad for him and he thought that both he and his son were better off without her but he didn 't understand what kind of person would abandon her son like that and he didn 't want that kind of person around his son. But they didn 't really talk about it after.

Nick 's husband doesn 't travel very often for work, but once a year, he goes to France for two weeks. Nick talks to him every day, but only about 3:00 in the afternoon (time there) because of the time difference. He works long hours and goes to bed pretty quickly afterwards, but he always calls Nick before he does. Yesterday, his ex called at about 5:00 their time (12:00 in France) and told Nick that she had tried to call Nick 's husband but he didn 't answer because he was asleep. She got Nick 's number from her parents who still have a decent relationship with their grandson, so Nick has their numbers so they can see him.

So anyway, she told Nick she 's going to be in town just for tonight and she was wondering if she could see her son. She said she would have called sooner but it was a last minute trip and it took her a little bit to work her way up to calling because she knew she 'd made a mistake and she wasn 't sure they 'd want to see her. Nick told her that Nick didn 't think her husband would like that very much and since he was out of town, Nick thought it would be best if she waited until he got back. Nick told her Nick would try to call him and ask, but he didn 't answer Nick either, so Nick called her back and told her to call back the next time she was in town. Nick told her Nick would talk to Nick 's husband and see what he thought when he was back in town but she said she wouldn 't be back for a while.

Nick is planning on asking her husband about it tomorrow when Nick talks to him, but she was pretty upset about it and said that she 's sure he would let her see her son and it was rude of Nick to not let her see him just based on something he had said four years ago. She said that Nick should have just as much right to decide who Nick 's son sees because Nick was in charge of him too and so since Nick 's husband was unreachable, Nick got to make the decision.

AITA for not letting her see him? Nick knows Nick 's really only heard one side of the story, but she doesn 't seem like a very good person and Nick doesn 't want her to see Nick 's son without Nick 's husband present, even if she is his mother.

0,"AITA For not caring about Nick's father's cafe? | (Obligatory) Hi this is Nick's first post here, Nick is not from the US so if there's any bad grammar or mis-interpretations Nick's bad,(also got a D for English). Nick immediately thought of this subreddit to come to and vent. (also am on mobile). This will also be very long.

Some backstory: Nick has recently turned 16, and Nick's brother 15, when Nick's father has recently opened up a cafe, and it has a rustic farmhouse theme, seeing that it is situated in an eco village, and next to a horse riding place (don't know the official word for it). Because of this, there are a RIDICULOUS amount of flies, and many, many rooster calls. The cafe also came with a small piece of land next to it, so Nick's father decided to make it a venue for hire for BBQs and parties.
Nick's father forced Nick and Nick's brother to work there from 7 till 7 every day of the week, without a single penny paid to them. Seeing that they started their summer holiday, it was very convenient for Nick's father, and not for Nick and Nick's brother.

Now for the main event.

It started yesterday, and it being a Saturday, Nick prayed for the 1% chance of avoiding work, but you can guess how that went. Nick begrudgingly went with Nick's father to work, and Nick really wasn't in the mood. At 12 o clock hayfever hit Nick harder than 911, and Nick's sinuses were as fucked up as Hong Kong's situation. Nick's auntie came over to visit them at work, and immediately noticed (she's like Nick's 2nd mom) and told Nick's father Nick is not fit to work. Like seriously, you could look at Nick's red, snotty face for a split second and see that. Nick's father on the other hand was having none of it, and forced Nick to continue to SERVE customers and wash dishes.
That night people also rented out to braai ( their version of BBQ) and Nick was not prepared for that at all. Nick ended up to staying till 11 at night, in sandals, shorts and a t-shirt. Nick finally left because Nick's aunt came to pick Nick and Nick's brother up. (thank you savior aunt). Nick's father was really pissed, but Nick didn't care.

So this morning Nick's father picked them up, Nick took some allergex, and they went back to work. After working and napping (like you in class with your head on the table) till 12, they had lunch. Nick's father told Nick to eat, but Nick was tired, so Nick said no. Nick's father warned Nick again, Nick didn't respond. 5 minutes later Nick got up and went to go eat. Nick cut himself some French loaf, and went to eat by himself. Someone (Nick's lazy cousins who visited) then cut for themselves and made a huge mess, crumbs everywhere, on the counter in which they served customers.
Nick's father got up, stood in front of it, and said that Nick must come clean it up NOW. Nick said nah, Nick's busy eating. Nick's father lost it. Nick's father asked if Nick doesn't care that a customer can come in and see this mess, Nick said of course not, Nick's busy eating. Nick's father kicked Nick out and sent Nick off the premises.

0,"AITA for not wanting the sister-in-law to stay in Nick's house | Nick's SIL (from US, unemployed) wanted to come to stay with Nick and her husband for a few months in Japan. She demanded $1300 for flight ticket, passport and traveling from the airport. Of course Nick and her husband would have to cover all the SIL's living expenses there too. Nick already had the horrible experience living with the SIL's mom in their house in Japan before, and ended up being homeless. So Nick strongly said no to the SIL's offer. Also, Nick and her husband couldn't afford her. They got frustrated saying that Nick was ugly about money, that all Nick cares about is money, and that to Nick money is more important than family. Nick straight up told them they were being greedy and selfish, and the SIL was not welcomed in Nick's house. Nick's words can be harsh when Nick is pissed off. But Nick did not get angry for no reason. Nick's husband pulled out from his credit card to send the SIL the money. She came anyways.

Despite disliking it so much, Nick still opened their door for her and treated her nicely. She got her own room with mattress and warm blanket. Nick works all day and Nick's son goes to nursery so she had the house for herself. Nick only saw her about 3 hours a day, at most. Nick asked Nick's husband to take her to places. Nick took her to a nice restaurant on the first day she arrived. Nick bought extra food and shared with her what Nick cooked. She was very quiet most of the time. It made Nick feel pretty awkward. She did help with the dishes and spent a little time with Nick's son. Nick said Nick appreciated that.

Then on the 3rd day, she started acting out. That morning Nick heard Nick's husband joking around about the coffee she was struggling to make. It was the first time they brought Japanese coffee so Nick got curious and asked ""how much was this coffee?"". Right after that she dumped out the coffee in front of Nick's face, stomped into her room, slammed the door and started crying. She said that Nick hurt her feelings, and that Nick is always concerned about money. Nick got pretty pissed off but did not say anything. Then, she came sit on Nick's chair, talking to someone on the phone a lot about how ignorant Nick was, and that she got really frustrated of Nick's behavior. Nick stopped her right there, told her she was being full of shit and this disrespectful behavior is not accepted in Nick's house. She yelled back then left. Later she came back and cried to Nick's husband about how she tried to run away from her dark life in US but when came there all she got was mean words from Nick. Nick stomped out of her room said everybody has their own problem but decent people would try to solve it themselves, not to bring burden to other people's shoulders like what she was doing. She jumped up and down and yelled back at Nick. They both blew up and threw hurtful words to each other. Nick asked her to get out of Nick's house. She didn't leave. She apologized. Nick did not. Nick is pregnant and all the stress she brought is hurting Nick's baby. Nick believed Nick doesn't deserve to be treated like that in Nick's house.

0,"WIBTA if Nick kicked these girls out of the troop? Nick was the leader of her daughter 's Girl Scout troop. The girls ranked as  'Juniors ', which ranged in age from 9-11. Before the end of the school year, they did a camping trip. Nick was setting up everything for the afternoon with the help of the adults, while they all made sure the girls stayed in the immediate area. They could see if the girls were going to try to leave bounds, but not exactly what the girls were doing.

After the first two activities, the girls had another break. Nick was doing something with one of the girls when Nick heard one of the 10-year-olds they 'll call Sasha yell out  'My iPod is missing! '

Now, iPods were not allowed on the trips to begin with, so Nick wasn 't sure why Sasha would bring it. But Nick asked when Sasha last saw it, if the other girls had, etc. One of the other girls said that they had seen one of the 9-year-olds looking at it, they 'll call her Megan. Nick said, okay. Nick talked to Megan; Megan hadn 't seen it. Okay. Sasha said she needed to find it or her mom would be so mad. Nick reminded Sasha that Nick had said not to bring electronics and that Nick wasn 't responsible.

Sasha and her friends went into the tent shared by the 9-year-olds (Megan included) and some of the 11-year-olds. Suddenly, Nick heard them say  'There it is! ' Nick went in and it was sitting in the front (mesh) pocket of Megan 's backpack. Nick called Megan in; Megan swore up and down that she didn 't do it, she would have no reason to take it and started crying. Nick didn 't know what to believe and Nick told everyone they needed to go sit down outside while Nick figured this out.

Nick talked with the other adults. They agreed the story sounded weird. Finally, Nick asked to talk to Megan privately. Again, Megan swore up and down she didn 't steal it. Megan was so upset. Nick got her to calm down and told her that it was going to be okay, she was not in trouble. Nick had another adult stay with Megan to read for a bit while Nick talked with the older girls (out of earshot of Megan). Nick said that if this was true, then Megan would be going home and not spending the weekend there. The girls looked smug. Nick then said  'Oh, and because she 's clearly dishonest and not living up to the Girl Scout law, Nick 's going to have to boot her out of the troop. '

That got one of the girls looking upset and Nick knew her gut feeling was right. Suddenly, the girl was whispering to Sasha and Nick asked what was up. The girl said that it was all Sasha 's idea to get Megan in trouble, because there were too many  'babies ' on the trip. They had plans for the other four 9-year olds (that wouldn 't have worked). Sasha eventually owned up to it.

Nick called these girls ' parents and had them picked up early. Nick told the girls ' parents that they would not participate in any more GS events for the rest of the schoolyear (last two weeks). Now, it was time for the new school year. Megan 's mom had recently said that Megan wanted to come back this year, but only if the three girls involved in this weren 't. Nick knew one wasn 't.

0,"AITA for telling someone they can 't bring their emotional support dog into their bakery? | Nick works in a bakery as a barista. An older man and a woman and two women came in. As Nick helps the women, Nick notices the older duo has a dog. As Nick goes to say, ""I'm sorry, but we can't allow animals in here,"" Nick sees the dog has a vest and assumed it was a service dog. As Nick takes the drinks out, the dog was standing in the middle of the caf '; the owners tried to get them to move but the dog didn't move, and Nick ended up spilling some of a latte trying to get around the dog.

Nick takes their order, and as Nick walks out the drinks Nick notices they put the dog on the bench so its head is now on the table. Then Nick sees on the vest that the dog is an emotional support animal, not a service animal like Nick thought. Now Nick has an ESA, and her letter permits her to go on airplanes and in housing, but not into businesses like service animals can. And in a bakery, it's a major health code violation.

Now Nick is in a pickle. They have their food and are eating, so Nick asks Nick's manager, what does Nick do? The manager says don't say anything cause they'll probably complain. Nick vented about how people can pay scam websites to get illegitimate letters and a vest and are promised you'll be able to take your pet anywhere, and how it makes it harder for people with service animals/legitimate ESAs to be taken seriously. The manager says that Nick can say something as they leave.

As they 're leaving, Nick says in Nick's normal cheery customer service tone, ""hi there, Nick just wanted to let you know that ESAs aren't allowed in businesses, and Nick let it slide this time because Nick thought they were a service animal at first and you had already ordered, but if you bring them next time Nick is going to have to ask you to leave."" The woman says okay and leaves. They stared into the shop as they slowly drove away.

Yesterday, she leaves a review saying it was her father's ESA and they were well-behaved (mind you, the dog didn't listen when asked to come)/clean/leashed, and she was looking forward to coming back until Nick was blunt and tactless. She said Nick had seen the dog before they ordered and said nothing, so ""maybe you should have told us that before we spent 30 plus dollars and tipped you."" Leaving out that Nick first thought they were a service animal. Nick didn 't do it for the sale, Nick was ready to ask her to leave as soon as Nick saw the dog, and frankly she can have her tip back. She said they didn't check up on them - something they don't usually do as a small bakery - smile, or make eye contact, the latter made Nick feel shitty because Nick has anxiety and PTSD which makes eye contact hard for Nick. Nick made eye contact with them at least twice each; Nick probably could have been better, but Nick was flustered about there being what Nick thought was a pet, then a service animal, and then an ESA. Not really a good excuse, but Nick doesn't necessarily think good eye contact is an end all to good customer service. Other than that, Nick's customer service game is pretty on point.

0,"AITA for getting Nick's roomate's boyfriend kicked out and am forcing them to keep thier cat in thier room? | Nick moved into a shared student apartment a week ago. As Nick's lease said, the rooms were single occupancy and animals were not to be kept in the common areas so Nick knew she was in the 'right', Nick just wanted to know if what Nick did was a dick move. It was also a female-only apartment.

Nick lived with international students (relevant because of communication issues) who all knew each other. At the time this all happened Nick only guessed they knew each other since it was hard to talk to them. At first, everything was ok. Nick's roommates were clean, quiet and seemed nice enough. They didn't talk at all but that was to be expected with cultural and language barriers. It was hard to talk with them but Nick was sure that went both ways.  Then, 2 days ago Nick went to leave the apartment and saw a ton of boxes and a guy in the house. All Nick's roommates were hanging out in the living room talking, w/e. Nick assumed he was just a friend helping one move in. Later that night Nick heard hissing under Nick's door. Nick left to check it out and realized that they had left their cat in the common area. This wouldn't normally be a big issue but Nick had a cat in Nick's room (why Nick chose this unit since it was animal-friendly) who was hiding in Nick's closet to avoid the hissing cat. This cat then spent the next two days hissing at Nick and the cat in Nick's room. Nick was also worried because there were now claw marks on the couches in the common area which Nick would also be liable for since Nick also had a cat.

That night Nick was kept up by male voice until 3 am. That morning Nick saw the guy in the kitchen and was going to try to figure out what was going on with him and the cat. Nick said hello and he literally said nothing and walked right past Nick into the bedroom. Nick was overtired, feeling ostracized like Nick didn't even live there and a little panicky (Nick specifically chose a female-only suit over co-ed because living with guys Nick didn't know made Nick very panicky) so Nick immediately contacted the management.  Management sent out a letter and the next day the guy came up to Nick and confirmed that he lived with his girlfriend, that the cat was a 'shared' cat and that no one else cared that he was there or the cat was there. Well, Nick cared and Nick told him that Nick had as much right as any other person (ie his friends) about what happens int eh common area. Nick then told the manager what he said and she got the ball rolling to have him forcibly kicked out next week.

Nick got married in a church in the countryside a few years ago. Her husband's parents lived in the city and it was a 90 minute drive to the church from their house the morning of the wedding. Nick was really stressed leading up to it and they come from a different culture where weddings just start when everyone turns up and the time for starting the ceremony isn't as strict. Nick called her mother in law 3 times before the date of the wedding to discuss the start time and Nick even had a conversation with her about how the wedding needed to start on time because the priest had another engagement in the afternoon (Nick isn't sure exactly what it was, could have been anything from a funeral to visiting some parishoners, in any event, the priest was really clear that they couldn't start the wedding late). 

Nick called her mother in law again twice leading up the wedding - Nick offered her to go to Nick's parents house beforehand and travel with them. Nick offered her to go to Nick's husband's house and get ready there. Nick gave her a map showing where the church was. Nick asked them if they needed her to explain the directions etc. They declined all these things and said they were fine, they didn't need any help etc. Nick normally wouldn't have done this but Nick knew it was an area of the country they weren't familiar with and the priest was putting pressure on her about the start time. 

Anyway, day of the wedding: Nick turned up to the church. The church was full. All of her husband's family was there, the bridal party, Nick's family. Nick's mother and father in law weren't there. Nick was standing there in front of the church, people just awkwardly looking at her from the pews, and everyone was buzzing around saying ""They're late! No one knows where they are! What are we going to do!"" Everyone was trying to call them but they weren't answering. The priest was annoyed at them and saying that they needed to start the wedding. 

Nick pushed back the start time again and again and managed to convince the priest to delay the start time by 45 minutes. Forty five minutes passed and Nick was still standing around, no sign of them. Her husband was freaking out and Nick said to him ""We probably need to start the wedding soon but they're your parents and you can make the decision whether we wait a bit longer or start."" He made the decision to start and Nick and her husband got married, his parents turned up just before they had the kiss. 

Anyway, people still think it was Nick's fault they missed their son's wedding. His family whisper about it. His parents never once apologised to them. Nick's parents still say it was a ""terrible"" thing that Nick did. Nick tends to think it's easier to make it Nick's fault because Nick is the daughter in law but this is still a whole thing 3 years later. Had Nick and her husband waited for them to arrive they would have had to wait 90 minutes, Nick and her husband waited 45 before starting.

0,"AITA for not following OCD mums rules? | Nick (23F) moved out of Nick's parents house in October but when the pandemic started they asked if Nick wanted to move back in temporarily so Nick wasn 't on Nick's own. Nick was nervous about being isolated for so long (history of mental health issues and Nick doesn 't cope well) so Nick said yes and moved in mid March.

Nick's mum has always ran her house in a very particular way. She has rules that, as kids, Nick and Nick's siblings always followed and never questioned because they just thought they were the norm. I.E nobody ever touches the curtains except Nick's mum, washing up is always done as soon as you finish eating, cushions are never allowed to touch the floor etc. Now Nick knows these things are really important to Nick's mum. Nick's mum used to have really bad OCD (would spend 6 hours a day folding towels until they were perfect) and she has got a lot better. Most things Nick does out of habit and aren 't an issue. But there are some rules that Nick is struggling so hard to follow and Nick and Nick's mum have had lots of arguments about it.

For instance, nobody is allowed to sleep past 9am on a weekday. Nick struggles getting to sleep at night and sometimes Nick is up until 2/3 am. But Nick's mum insists that everyone gets up anyway even though they then have little to do in the day. Regardless of whether everyone gets up or not, Nick's mum always comments things like  'you might be happy being lazy slobs but I don 't want to live like that ' and is always making little remarks about everyone 's day.

Eating is an issue. They have time windows as to when they can eat certain meals and if you miss it, you don 't eat. Like today, Nick's parents were doing some work on the kitchen. Nick went in to make some toast but Nick's mum said no as Nick would be in the way. Nick then went back when they were finished to be told no again because it was too late. Nick hasn 't eaten.

They 're not allowed to do things that make a mess. To pass the time Nick brought some arts and crafts and puzzles home. But nope. Too messy. Nick's dad isn 't allowed to get his DJ equipment out because Nick's mum can 't stand the wires. Then everyone gets moaned at if they just sit and watch tv.

There 's other things like, doors and windows have to be open all day even though it 's cold, Nick is forced to take medication Nick doesn 't really want. (Nick is asthmatic and Nick's mum insists an antihistamine a day will help but Nick never takes them at Nick's own home and Nick is fine) Nick is always called to help out while Nick's 19 year old brother does sod all. And then to top it all off, everyone gets moaned at if they don 't help out but if they do everything is redone because it isn 't the way Nick's mum likes it.

Nick decided to confront Nick's mum and Nick's brother and dad agreed with Nick but it just ended in a massive argument, with Nick's mum saying they were all picking on Nick's mum. It 's now really tense and Nick is just so frustrated. Nick knows Nick should be grateful that Nick's parents are letting Nick stay and Nick needs to take Nick's mums OCD in to account, but should Nick's mum really have this much control over everyone?

0,"WIBTA for not giving Nick's sister a share of Nick's inheritance - to give to her daughters? | Nick's father died last year. Beforehand he showed Nick the final copy of his will - it was simple, 50% to Nick, 50% to Nick's half-sister.  

&nbsp;  

Nick wasn't always close with his Dad (parents split when Nick was young) and as a result Nick has never been close with his half-sister. She's much older than Nick, they've never lived together and until last summer they hadn't seen each other in 10 years. She has two daughters, one of whom Nick has never met. At this meeting, she did mention she'd *hoped* Dad would give something specifically to her daughters, but Nick shrugged this off as he knew he hadn't and Nick assumed she must not have seen the will.  

&nbsp;  

A few months later and upon sorting the estate, Nick is waiting for her to send Nick some documents, including the will, to sign. Nick messages to ask if she's received them yet and if she can forward them to Nick. This message is the reply Nick gets;  

&nbsp;  

'*I need to talk to you - Dad did want to leave something to the girls but was too ill to sort!*'  

&nbsp;  

Again, when shown the will and multiple times discussing it with him later, Nick's Dad didn't once say he'd wanted to change anything. Asking for clarification, in genuinely as calm a tone as Nick writes this post, stating that he'd been through the will with Nick beforehand, Nick simply asks what exactly Dad said he wanted to change? From seemingly nowhere Nick then receives this exact response;  

&nbsp;  

'*Hang on! What's your problem with this? I don't want the money it would go straight into the girls account. I'm surprise you are even doubting it!!!! Think about it, Dad loved my girls and wanted them look after. I spent a lot more time with dad so had more opportunities to discuss this. He even had their bank details in the care home but I could ask him to call the bank as he was too ill and too tired. Fucking hell, are you for real?!*'  

&nbsp;  

Asking her to calm down, stating all Nick ever did was ask what Dad said and how much he'd wanted to give to them, Nick eventually gets clarification that they never discussed specifics - 'he just said he wanted them looked after'. Happy to provide his messages word for word in the comments if need be, Nick is just aware of going over the character limit here.  

&nbsp;  

Despite not being close with them and not having even met both daughters, as someone with no children of his own, Nick had previously considered offering some of the money as extra to them. But due to being largely kept out of the loop of funeral organisation and in the end only being told about the burial of the ashes literally less than 48 hours beforehand, Nick realised as they really aren't close, that's not his concern and if that's what Dad *really* wanted, he'd have included it in the will in the first place. This latest exchange just cements that feeling.  

&nbsp;  

Would Nick be the asshole for this? Again, they're not close and Nick can tell you with certainty that once this is over, they'll go back to rarely speaking to each other - but they are technically his nieces.",FALSE,FALSE,3,4,2,5,1,3,Authority,573
0,"Is Nick the Asshole for calling his school principal out on BS? | Nick goes to a private christian school and they have a 15 minute period between classes called  'chapel time ' 3 days a week. Typically it consists of either singing a hymn or a bible lesson or both. 

On this particular day they were handed out a new song and for some reason Nick ended up with all the extras (probably 50 extra sheets.) Nick asked the people on either side of him if they wanted to keep passing the stack but they said no. While the papers were being passed out the speaker (who happened to be the principal that day) started his lesson on the meaning behind the song. 

Nick still had the stack of papers and nowhere to put them so he set them on the floor. The principal continued speaking while he was setting the papers on the floor. Anyways after a couple minutes he got more settled and his head was facing slightly down, as this is the most comfortable position for him to sit in. He should mention he was still listening to what the principal was saying and he wasn 't being distracting. 

While he was looking slightly down he heard the principal stop speaking and go  'Is there a problem? ' He didn 't know he was talking to him so he didn 't even move his head up to look at the principal. Still, the room was silent so after 5 or 10 seconds of nobody talking he finally looked up to see what was going on and sure enough, the principal was staring right at him. He was confused as to what was going on so he said  'No, he was just looking slightly down but paying attention. ' 
The principal continued speaking. 

He thought that that would be the end of the story. But about 15 minutes later he got called to the office. The principal sat him down and told him that his response was very disrespectful. He said Nick should never talk back to an adult but rather just be silent. Nick replied by saying that the way he worded the question made it seem like he wanted a response. 
The principal then said  'you also disrupted the whole school and made me stop to discipline you. ' 
Nick responded by saying  'You are the one who disrupted chapel time by stopping the whole thing because he was looking down instead of up. ' 

Nick then asked the principal why he thought he was being a distraction. The principal said that Nick was not giving him his full attention and it was obvious because he was not looking at him. 

Nick told him that out of the many kids in the chapel room, he was not the only person who was not looking directly at the principal while he was speaking. 
He proceeded to tell him that he thought he was overreacting and misusing his authority. 

The principal kept insisting that Nick's response was unnecessary and that he should never ever talk back to authority, and Nick kept insisting that there was no way his behavior was inappropriate. 

Eventually the principal gave up trying to debate him and they both agreed to think more about their actions before they do them. 

So Nick's question is: Is Nick the Asshole? Did he go too far in trying to argue with a figure of authority in his school?",FALSE,FALSE,2,4,3,5,2,3,Authority,562
0,"AITA for Watching Nick's Co-Worker's Career Burn When Nick Could've Stopped It? | Nick (30M) works using the end-products from his co-worker, let's call her Sammy. When she's unable to do her work, or gets it wrong, Nick ends up being unable to do his work or at least unable to finish it completely because it's missing things from her.

Now, Nick has the skills to just fill in the missing parts, for example, if she forgets to add an order for their client, Nick can just do it for her. However, she's relatively new to the job so Nick figures it's better to tell her she forgot something, and show her how to do it so she won't repeat the mistake later on.

BIG MISTAKE

The interaction is brief, like 5 seconds. This is the first time Nick has ever corrected her for anything.

Nick: Hey Sammy, when we get this request from our client, you have to add this order in.
Sammy: Oh, right...

Nick hands her the request, she fixes it, and gives it back to Nick later. No big deal.

Later on, at lunch, Nick's buddy tells him she's been talking shit behind his back. Nick figures that sucks, screw her then.

Afterwards, she seems to be learning her job well and doesn't make many more errors. The PROBLEM IS she's still talking crap about Nick behind his back. Nick has different people telling him to:
1) Leave her alone OR 2) People telling him she's talking crap behind his back.

Nick goes to her and asks if there's anything she wants to say to him. She says no, Nick asks if she's sure, she says yes, Nick says alright then.

The shit-talking only intensifies, and apparently Nick is harassing her at work now. Drama ensues, only a few people are sticking by Nick, which kinda makes him sad but at least now Nick knows who he can depend on.

Now comes the day when Nick sees she makes a small mistake but could lead to a large inconvenience for their client. Nothing that would destroy lives but would delay their client's schedule and would make them very unhappy. This mistake went past her, her co-workers, her supervisor, and apparently nobody noticed the problem before it got to Nick.

So... Nick sends an e-mail to her supervisor about the issue, which is standard protocol but the supervisor is gone for the day and they should (but don't) bother reading their e-mails after they leave.

The next day the client personally shows up and asks about this issue because he arrived in the morning and his people can't get to work because they were missing critical components for their operation.

Their boss smooths things over, gives them a discount on the order, and promises to take care of it himself. The client is satisfied, and leaves with no fuss.

The boss finds out Sammy was the one who made the initial error and fires her, everyone else gets warnings except the supervisor, who said she read Nick's e-mail and was trying to fix the issue. The boss leaves, the supervisor thanks Nick for catching the problem (she probably doesn't realize Nick could've fixed it himself since it's not actually his job to, and everyone else was too scared to say anything).

0,"AITA for being short with Nick's neighbour after he let himself into her gated backyard? | This literally just happened and Nick was still kinda ticked. For context, Nick was an early 30s woman who lived with her boyfriend. Nick was frequently home during the day while he was at work. The neighbours in question were backyard neighbours, so the back of their backyard ran along the side of Nick's backyard. Nick hoped that made sense. 

Soo Nick was just getting ready to take a shower, was undressed under her housecoat and grabbing a towel from the linen closet when she heard knocking at her door, followed a minute later by the doorbell. Nick wasn't expecting anyone, and in her current state of undress she didn't feel comfortable answering the door, so she ignored it. 

Nick was about to head to the bathroom when she saw a couple people coming down the driveway. Halfway down the drive they have a gate that they keep shut, latched and locked whenever they're home. It's over 5 feet tall and super awkward to unlatch/unlock from the outside. So Nick watched their figures through the closed curtains walking up and down the drive a couple times until they gave up and left. 

Nick got dressed then because she was like, Wtf is going on? Not five minutes have gone by, when she opens her front door and sees no one, no cars. But she sees the front gate was left opened. She goes over to close it, because they keep all gates closed so that their dog can roam freely, and sees that the back gate is still closed. 

So Nick heads back inside when she hears a far-off *Helloooo?*. Nick has pretty sensitive anxiety and it just spiked at this point. She heads to the back door and sees someone standing there. It took her a moment to figure out it was her neighbor. He was very jovial, told her he was trying to get a hold of her because they had the cable guy over and he wanted access to her backyard. Nick was like, ""Fine, whatever. Bye."" But he kept asking if something was wrong, and kept pressing her when she tried to go back inside. 

Her dog ran out and with the gates being open she called him back inside, and her neighbour continued to press her if there was anything wrong. Nick snapped and said, ""Yes! I was getting in the shower and then there were people running all around the house. I didn't know what was going on.""

He got really offended and reiterated that they weren't *in* her house. She said, ""No, just letting yourself through a locked gate and coming to the back door instead of waiting at the front door and ringing the bell again."" She closed the door and he let himself back out the gate, and the cable guy never even came in the backyard. 

Nick was feeling a bit jerky but also like, no. His wife came and left after ringing the bell. He then took it upon himself to come back, not even attempt to go to the front door, but let himself into the closed yard when Nick was home by herself and hadn't answered at the front door?

0,"AITA for not asking Nick's father to walk Nick down the aisle? | Throwaway for personal reasons.

Nick (27F) was engaged, planning to get married to Nick's partner (30F) of 3yrs the next year. Since Nick came out as bi (when Nick was 15) Nick's dad hadn't been supportive of Nick. He was upset when Nick first told him about Nick's fiancee & had made it clear he didn 't approve of Nick being with a woman. He was v distant when Nick took her to Nick's parents ' home for dinner, wouldn't talk to her when making conversation at the dinner table. When Nick's fiancee wasn't around he'd made a lot of subtle cutting comments about her/their relationship despite Nick telling him to back off, he made it v clear in general that he didn 't see her as family. Basically he'd been casually homophobic Nick's entire life, you know the type. He wasn't providing any financial support for the wedding & when Nick asked if he would actually be attending the wedding he just gave Nick a snide ""we'll see"" so Nick honestly wasn't even expecting he would turn up.

Part of their intended wedding ceremony would involve Nick being walked down the aisle & given away, Nick enjoyed a lot of the classic wedding traditions & that was one Nick really wanted to carry out. Nick assumed Nick's dad wouldn't want to walk Nick down the aisle, tbh Nick didn't want him to either, so Nick asked a male friend (58M) instead (1 week ago). This man had known Nick for almost half Nick's life, he was like a mentor to Nick & honestly had been more of a father figure to Nick than Nick's actual dad had, Nick loved him like a paternal figure. They met when Nick was 16, he was teaching an acting class Nick signed up for (they both worked in theatre). He'd provided lots of emotional support over the years & been openly supportive of Nick's relationship from the start. He had two sons around Nick's age & had said before he saw Nick a bit like the daughter he never had. He said he'd be honoured to give Nick away.

Nick's dad learned of this fact recently, Nick wasn 't sure how. He was FURIOUS, he said Nick was undermining his authority as a parent & making him look like an asshole/fool to everyone who attended the wedding & if Nick insisted on going through with this he wouldn 't attend at all, there was no way he was going to sit at a table & watch some other man give Nick away. He was pissed Nick didn't ask him. After he said that Nick asked if he would have said yes, he dodged the question & yelled at Nick & eventually hung up on Nick.

Nick admitted Nick didn't consider asking him & Nick honestly didn't see the need to. Nick guessed it would be embarrassing for Nick's dad if he came but considering his behaviour towards Nick & Nick's fiancee over the course of their relationship Nick didn 't feel like he was justified to make this demand.

Nick's parents and Nick live next to a deaf-mute couple who own two dogs. In the past Nick and his family had no issue with them, but their neighbours have allowed their dogs to bark all day for HOURS ON END. Naturally due to the neighbours' deafness, they cannot hear their dogs barking and it simply continues....

When the issue first occured, Nick and his family left a note in their mailbox politely explaining that Nick's brother and father work jobs that require them to wake up early in the mornings and the incessant barking was becoming an issue. A week went by and Nick and his family received no response, yet the barking continued. Eventually Nick's mother contacted the father of the deaf-mute husband and explained the situation, his only response was to laugh and tell Nick's mother ""your husband and son should just use ear plugs or sleep in different rooms"".

Nick's mother decided to contact the local council about the issue. After about two months, the council issued a formal warning. The barking continued....

Nick's mother contacted the father again abd explained Nick and his family's situation, the father explained in an irritated manner that ""the dogs are there to help his deaf-mute son and wife with their daily activities due to their conditiod, and that Nick and his family should just put up with it"". Nick and his family were confued, surely there is no need for their dogs to incessantly bark like that though?

Eventually Nick and his family sought mediation from the council, and the council ruled that one of the dogs be separated and live at the father's property. The neighbours were not happy but complied for a while.

This brings Nick to the present. Nick is starting to get fed up with the fact that the neighbours seem to pay no regard to Nick and his family or the official warnings issued by the council.

So Nick took matters into his own hands.

Unhappy with the fact that the father neighbours are so inconsiderate and seemingly thinking that this issue is a big joke by laughing at Nick and his family whenever they see them, Nick contacted the father himself this time. Nick explained to him that the barking has continued for months now despite Nick and his family's complaints, and how his son laughs whenever he sees Nick and his family, Nick gave him an ultimatum.

They either adhere to the official orders ruled by the council, or Nick takes the matter to the court. This did not sit well with the father, as he decided to abuse Nick over the phone calling, Nick's family horrible people, stripping his disabled son and wife of their right to have dogs.

Nick filed for the court proceeding and the magistrate ruled both dogs off the premises as it was quite clear to her that the dogs were merely pets, rather than aids, as there was no paper-work to prove such a thing.

While Nick and his family are happy with this outcome, they still cop abuse from the husband and dead-mute neighbours occassionally....

0,"AITA for wanting to wear a specific blazer to prom against Nick's parents will? | Ok so basically Nick (17F) wants to go to her prom with a suit because Nick thinks they look super good on women and Nick deserved it because this year has been rough. Nick even had a blazer bought 2 years in advance, but her parents hate it with a passion.
Nick and her mother went to look for cocktail outfits and Nick's mother and Nick liked some tight pants and a top. Nick tried it on with her blazer and Nick liked it, but the trousers seemed off (they were emerald green, the top was white and the blazer was black). Nick and her mother went back home with both things, but Nick was unconvinced with the trousers.
Nick and her mother arrived at home and Nick's mother told that to Nick's father. They saw the photos Nick took with both the blazer and without it. At first, Nick's father told Nick that they just needed to find an emerald blazer. Nick even volunteered to pay it with her pocket money, he said it was not about the money.
However, Nick's parents both started making comments in front of Nick about how Nick was looking like a manager if Nick wore a blazer, along more harsh comments. They laughed in front of Nick while they were saying that.
Nick is quite the self-aware person and seeing the people that are supposed to care about Nick say those horrible things about how Nick looked in her dream prom outfit overwhelmed Nick. Nick had a breakdown and went to her room. While Nick was at the room, Nick's mother told something to Nick's father and then he spent all lunch telling Nick that Nick only leeches money and food off them, and that they weren't going to pay for Nick's college tuition (they know fully well how much Nick wants to go to another college to spend less time with them); suddenly it was about the money and they were using it against Nick ('we paid for the two parts so you don't have anything to say'). Nick decided to say nothing and stormed to her room as soon as Nick finished lunch.

Nick knows this sounds super edgy and a basic white teen problem, but Nick feels so bad about this situation. Nick is used to her parents being volatile and pulling out those manipulative tactics, but now Nick is turning 18 in a few months and Nick feels like this situation is... Wrong. It's Nick's prom, and Nick should wear what Nick wants, right? Nick's parents have known about Nick's suit plans since Nick bought the blazer when Nick was 15, and they have always chose Nick's clothes against Nick's will. Can't Nick have at least one opportunity to dress how Nick wants to?

She has a nice house and rent probably wouldn't be too expensive.

Nick told Nick's sister that Nick would still have to think about it, because Nick couldn't come up with an answer on the spot. Nick also told Nick's sister Nick needed to know the details, to which she said ""like?"" and Nick told Nick's sister that was for her to tell Nick because she was the landlord (details would obviously include prices for rent, internet, gas, water and electricity bills, how much Nick would chip in for general shopping items, etc).

Before she told Nick all that, she decided to tell Nick her household rules. They included the following: no eating or drinking (unless using a bottle) in the bedroom, no mess in Nick's room, Nick couldn't go out every night (Nick needed to stay home some nights), Nick couldn't bring guys home (Nick could only sometimes), Nick's friends couldn't come over regularly, Nick would need to chip in with her dog cleaning chores, Nick would be the driver if they needed to go shopping, and Nick needed to cook the meals if they were having the same meal.

After reading that, Nick was like wtf. Nick told Nick's sister Nick wouldn't be moving in somewhere to be parented, if Nick wanted to bring guys home Nick would, Nick wouldn't be loud though because Nick was considerate that others were in the house. If Nick wanted to have a friend over, Nick didn't need to ask, and Nick could eat whatever Nick wanted to, etc etc. She goes to Nick ""is that how Nick thinks it works everywhere?"" To which Nick said yes.

Nick is a law student, so Nick sent Nick's sister some laws that showed what she was asking of Nick was illegal, as she would be Nick's legal landlord and having those requirements weren't legal for a landlord to ask. While rules were obvious, every house had them, the general gist of the laws where Nick lived were as long as Nick wasn't damaging the property, as long as Nick was paying the rent on time, there wasn't much else a landlord could require of someone -- they could deny anyone living there for whatever reason, but they couldn't tell Nick what Nick was allowed to do in that space. Sorry if Nick wasn't making sense, Nick was tired. It was obviously not the same in every area or country, but that was how it was in the area where Nick lived.

She wasn't impressed, and started to ignore Nick. But Nick wasn't having it, that was why Nick sent her some laws about what she was doing.

The service is similar to Life360 but just gives location updates. They also have him text when he 's leaving and when he 's arriving anywhere, which is quite honestly a drag when he 's with friends but it is what it is. For background Nick is a 17 year old high school senior with straight A 's and also takes a couple college courses (at his parents request) on the side. He will also be turning 18 before he goes away for college. His parents claim they only use the service when they feel worried about him and his 20 year old sister 's safety. For his sister, his mom says she only checks the location at night when she is walking back to her dorm or is out doing something. It amazed Nick that she is okay with this.

At this time, Nick allows the service because he is not an adult and has little to no pull on them (ie when he had to argue with them for years about his 9 o 'clock bedtime until they finally removed it this year), however he told them that once he goes to college, he will be turning off the service on his phone. This was met with a very negative reaction. His parents argue that if he has nothing to hide, what 's the harm. They also argue that if he 's somewhere and he needs help, how will they know where to send police. Their evidence for this is the countless hazing cases in frat culture, which he has no intention of joining.

To Nick however, he views this app as 24/7 stalking and a violation of privacy. This app is absolutely ludicrous and makes him feel very uncomfortable, not because he plans on doing anything illegal or dangerous, but simply because he doesn 't want to followed and monitored because it not only degrades him to the status of child, but also shows that his parents don 't trust him. Furthermore, it comes off to him that his parents are being control freaks who are not willing to respect his boundaries. In case it is important, when they last had this argument, they said if he didn 't keep the service enabled on his phone then they will be cutting him off, to which he replied that was counter intuitive, as it would prevent him from calling them for help in the event that he actually needed it.

Some extra information in case it is needed:
-the college Nick plans on attending is about 3 hours away

The problem started about four months ago though. All of a sudden, they had both sides of their family butting their noses into the wedding and giving their opinions on everything... They even had some weird triangulation where Nick would address something with her future mother in law, and she would text him to try to convince him otherwise.

The worst of it though was Nick 's mother. She had always been Nick 's best friend. The problem though was she was super assertive and took over anything she worked on. With Nick 's wedding, she had decided that she wanted to buy all the booze, that they should have custom water bottle labels (which neither Nick 's fianc ' nor Nick cared about), that they now needed a day of coordinator, that they needed to plan for what people should do between the ceremony and reception, and had started bringing on herself to plan these things and more.

Sometime they talked for 45min straight with Nick 's mother just telling Nick what they should do for the wedding. Nick got 2-3 words in. It had started happening that if they said no, Nick 's mother got incredibly upset. They only wanted a simple wedding, but Nick 's mother kept making it bigger and more complicated, plus told them stuff that they wanted was silly and would confuse people.

Nick had noticed that when they got into these conversations, Nick 's heart started pounding really fast and Nick started feeling super anxious ' to the point Nick was getting nightmares of Nick 's mother telling Nick everything Nick had to do in Nick 's life and that Nick didn 't have enough time to do it all. Nick had woken up in tears from it. Nick started feeling overwhelmed when they were talking and then Nick snapped and said something like  'Mom, you aren 't listening to Nick. Nick needs you to stop. This is too much. ' This offended Nick 's mother to the point she yelled or cried.

Nick 's mother was dealing with some bad work issues and felt unappreciated there. When they didn 't use her ideas or told her to back off a bit, she felt her help was unappreciated for the wedding. Nick felt like Nick 's mother was having a bit of a mid-life crisis of not feeling needed anymore. Last night, Nick 's mother told Nick that she wished Nick would have just eloped.

Nick didn 't want Nick 's wedding to break apart this close bond Nick 's mother and Nick had always had. Nick had dreamed of Nick 's wedding since Nick was a little girl.

Nick loves food and Nick 's very explorative with Nick 's tastebuds and Nick is always willing to try new food. Of those new foods involves beef or pork. Because of Nick 's religion(Hinduism), Nick was barred from eating beef or pork. Initially Nick didn 't care but when Nick started becoming more of a foodie it became enraging. Nick tried beef once when Nick went to a fair with some people for a trip. Nick 's whole group wanted burgers so Nick didn 't want to contest because Nick was shy to tell them. Nick got really turned off from veggie burgers because the last few Nick had were so bad. So Nick got a regular cheeseburger. Nick bit into it and the first bite felt like a whole new world of taste.

It just feels like nothing replaces beef or pork. Nick tries all the general stuff Nick uses to beat cravings like mints and gum but it didn 't work. Whenever Nick gets the opportunity Nick goes grab something beef or pork related and chows down like no tomorrow. Nick always does it behind their back. Recently even Nick 's brother has started doing it because he tried it and loved it.

Nick just thinks about how when Nick was born Nick was forced to follow a religion Nick didn 't want to. Nick just hates how Nick has to comply with rules of a religion just because Nick 's family follows them. Nick has thought of what if Nick gets busted. Nick sometimes likes to think Nick 's justified because Nick thinks it 's dumb they are pushing their made up rules on to Nick and that it 's just nature when you are not allowed to do something your first instinct would be to do it.

0,"AITA for not wanting to get a job right now? | Nick's parents want him to get a job. Nick completely gets that, no problem. The problem is, Nick currently feels like it'll completely overwhelm his schedule. 
Nick is a homeschooled senior, but Nick still has an online full-time course load, with band practice, gym, and flying lessons (which Nick is pursuing as a career) on top of that, and Nick really doesn't have any free time during the week. From Nick's parents' point of view, they see Nick on his computer for 6-8 hours a day, and associate it with Nick goofing off/gaming. Because of this, they've always piled Nick's schedule up with a ton of extracurricular activities, which made Nick absolutely miserable. (This contributed to a hospitalization for personal reasons in 2015, when Nick was 15.) 

This year, Nick managed to get rid of some of the extracurricular activities, with the main one being tennis, which was around 10 hours a week. While this has helped a ton with Nick's mental health and his grades, Nick's parents aren't too happy about it, and they've told Nick that because of this, they want him to get a job. Now, Nick has absolutely nothing against getting a job. Nick has worked a summer job at a restaurant for the past 4 years, so the idea of Nick getting a job/working isn't one Nick is worried about. The problem Nick is having is that his parents want him to get one right now, just to completely fill his schedule. 

Nick's parents know that Nick is going to be working full time this summer, and that Nick wants to get said job. Nick has tried talking to his parents about letting him finish up school, which is going to be wrapping up in 3 months, but they constantly say that Nick's schedule needs to be completely filled. They constantly talk about how they when they were younger, they had both school and jobs, and they were completely fine, but from Nick's point of view, Nick is not them, and Nick can't really tolerate that kind of 24/7 schedule.

Over the past week, Nick and his parents have been fighting a lot over this. Anytime Nick tries and talks to his parents about it, they pretend to be understanding, but then completely ignore anything Nick is saying, and their conversations go nowhere. They constantly say that if Nick doesn't get a job, they're going to kick him out, (Nick is 18, they can.), which will prevent Nick from going to college this fall due to being homeschooled. 

Honestly, Nick doesn't know what to think about either himself or his parents anymore, and Nick feels like there's nothing Nick can do. The only thing Nick wants to do is finish up his school before Nick puts anything else on his plate.

0,"AITA for asking Nick's Dad to put on a sweater or a blanket instead of turning up the thermostat? Nick is fully aware of the role reversal here.

Nick is 22 and Nick lives with Nick's parents. Nick pays rent for the room, as well as half of utilities, grocery bills, and taxes. As far as Nick knows, Nick's parents are happy with Nick living with them since Nick helps pay the bills, helps maintain the house, and they get to see Nick all the time. Nick thought there was no tension there, but Nick supposes maybe there is.

It 's winter and it 's been getting quite cold. Nick noticed that the bills for oil have been skyrocketing. Nick's parents ' house is big, has all old (20+ year old) windows, and cathedral ceilings, so it 's never been cheap, but it 's way more than anyone should expect.

Over the past few weeks, Nick has also noticed that the house has been roasting. Nick went and looked at the thermostat those times, and it was set to 80+. Nick's Mom did not do it, so it had to have been Nick's Dad. These times the house has been hot, Nick's Dad has been on the couch wearing boxer shorts and an undershirt. Nick feels like this is very wasteful, so Nick went to talk to Nick's Dad.

Nick: Hey Dad, Nick has been noticing you 've been turning up the heat a lot.
Dad: Yeah, Nick's Dad is old now, Nick's Dad gets cold.
Nick: Yeah, Nick gets it, Nick has been cold too. Nick has been thinking though, maybe Nick's family could do a house policy where Nick's family could put on double socks, sweaters, and pants, and maybe try blankets, before turning up the heat. Nick's family could save some money.
Dad: A house policy? Nick's Dad is sorry, whose house is this? Is it Nick's? Or did Nick's Dad buy it?
Nick: Nick has been paying half of the bills and rent, Nick thinks Nick has some say.
Dad: If Nick buys Nick's own house, Nick will have a lot of say.
Nick: If Nick's Dad would like Nick to move out, Nick will.
Dad: That 's not Nick's Dad's point. Just mind Nick's business.

Nick told Nick's Mom Nick was considering getting Nick's own apartment, but Nick's Mom argued Nick out of it, saying Nick's Dad is old and needs help plowing the driveway (true) and it 's winter/holidays so Nick won 't have good luck with apartments anyway. Nick's Mom told Nick to consider Nick's Dad 's age and try to give Nick's Dad some slack. Nick told Nick's brother, who agreed, saying that it 's Nick's Dad 's house, Nick's Dad 's thermostat, Nick's Dad 's rules.

Nick drained the battery in his electric car Nick found 3 charging locations near him, 1 at a mall, 1 at a AAA business center thing, and 3 was at a local cafe. 

The mall was all being used, AAA was broken and when Nick pulled up to the Cafe there was a gas Audi parked in the spot. Nick googled his states law and it states:

> Florida Statute 366.94?Electric vehicle charging stations
(3)(a)?It is unlawful for a person to stop, stand, or park a vehicle that is not capable of using an electrical recharging station within any parking space specifically designated for charging an electric vehicle.
(b)?If a law enforcement officer finds a motor vehicle in violation of this subsection, the officer or specialist shall charge the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle in violation with a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as provided in s. 316.008(4) or s. 318.18.

Nick was stuck waiting here since Nick didn 't have enough to get him to the next one (which could be broken or in use) and it was the only one working since AAA was broken and not just busy. 

Nick called the non-emergency line to complain, Nick even asked two workers if they knew whose car it was, they didn 't know.  Nick waited in the closest spot hoping police or owner of said car would do something. 

Cop shows up comes over to Nick an says  'There is no law for this so why did you call me? ' Nick showed him the above quoted statue and he says  'I have to look this up. '  He goes back to his squad car and the owner comes out yelling at Nick that it 's his car and he paid $1500 to install that and if he wants to park there he will and Nick needs to get off his property or he will hit Nick with trespassing. Now Nick has to pay to park and charge in that spot, this was not a free charge while you eat/shop kind of thing. Cop comes out to say that Nick is right, it is illegal to block the spot and he also cannot ask Nick to leave because Nick is paying for the spot and Nick has a contract with ChargePoint the actual owner of the charger.

0,"AITA for continuously reporting Nick's colleagues mistakes, resulting in one coworker being so stressed she had to take a leave of absence? | Nick is going to try and keep this kind of fuzzy for anonimities sake. Nick is a nurse who works in a community setting - Nick sees 10+ patients in a day, some for woundcare, some palliative (symptom management for those with progressive illnesses through end of life until death), and anything inbetween. Nick has 6 colleagues that Nick works with in a day and they each have their own area that they cover.

The backbone of nursing is good documentation. Without it you're at risk of losing your license. It's drilled into our heads since day 1 in school, and is a very basic component and expectation of the job. 3 nurses Nick works with are negligent in their assessments and charting. They don't complete weekly wound measurements (the gold standard to ensure no deterioration occurs), they aren't ordering supplies for their patients, and they aren't completing thorough assessments.

At the start Nick gave them gentle reminders about best practice, and offered constructive criticism on how they could improve. This didn't work, so Nick gave feedback to management (omitting names) on what Nick was noticing so it could be discussed at the meetings. After numerous reminders and emails sent out over the span of months (by management) with no improvement Nick sat down frustrated, as their negligence resulted in more work for Nick and adverse effects for patients (as specific as Nick would like to be.. But there were a few serious incidents where patients became upset to the point of tears as a result).

After months of leeway Nick has started reporting any errors Nick catches directly to management including the name of the nurse. They finally listened, and sent out an email saying continued negligence will result in nurses being reprimanded up to and including termination + mandatory reporting to the nurse regulatory body in the province. This week Nick caught a TON of errors from one nurse in specific. Some smaller stuff: No wound measurements, not fully completing an admission chart, not ordering supplies on specified order days. Some bigger stuff, too: no vitals taken or a thorough pain assessment done (on a complex palliative patient.. There is no excuse for this), not answering patient page outs, etc.

This eventually lead to this nurse having her first written warning in her employee file. Nick overheard her crying today, saying she's going to take a stress leave. Nick feels like Nick is the cause. Yes, she continuously didn't complete basic tasks of her job, however Nick feels like a tattletale.

0,"AITA for letting a customer stand outside in rain and 42 degree weather? | Nick works at a small vitamin store. The store is very small so, other than Fridays and Saturdays, Nick and the manager work alone. The store opens at 9am but Nick and the manager get to the store between 8:30-8:45am to print the reports and get the store ready for open. Today Nick managed to get out of the house a little early and got to the store with enough time to sit and unwind after the reports were printed, which is rare; Nick is usually rushing to open the door because the ancient IBM POS is super fucking slow.

Anyway, Nick got to store around 8:20 and got the reports printed by 8:35, blocked/faced his shelves and then went to the stockroom to sit for a few minutes and have a drink, eat some of his breakfast. The weather there is absolutely abysmal today; stinging, pouring rain, high-mile winds, slight sleet, just freaking awful. The store is in North Carolina and right on the coast and way south, so this weather is somewhat unusual there this late in the winter season.

Around 8:50 Nick heard someone banging on the front door. The store still had ten minutes to go before opening. Nick is not technically allowed to let people in before the posted hours but Nick's boss told Nick it was his discretion. Nick went up and cracked the door and asked why they were banging. Guy says he'd been standing out there for about thirty minutes, which was a big fat fucking lie because Nick would have seen him while printing the reports and blocking/facing his shelves. Nick told him that the store opens in ten minutes and Nick would let him in then. He asked Nick did Nick expect him to wait in that weather for another ten minutes. Nick reminded him that no one forced him to wait outside and he could have easily waited in his car. Then Nick shut and locked the door and returned to his breakfast sandwich.

Nick unlocked the doors promptly at 8:59 as usual, hit the lights, and waited for his customers. The guy had left and so far hasn't been back. Nick knows from a rulebook standpoint he is in the clear, if hours are posted and no customers allowed until such time; but from a moral standpoint, was Nick an asshole? Nick means, other than being ten minutes before opening the store was ready and the POS was ready for transactions, Nick just didn't feel like handling a customer before he was mentally prepared.

Nick's MIL and aunt soon got involved and kept telling Nick and his fiancee how they need to change the wedding. Aunt said they can 't do it on the beach because her cousin (who Nick met once when Nick was like 7 and barely knows) is in a wheelchair and can 't access the beach. She invited like 100 people Nick doesn 't know or barely knows and half of whom already decided to come. Nick's MIL called the church(without Nick and his fiancee's permission) and told them to reschedule the wedding because her stepson is having a wedding a month after Nick's and she wanted their weddings to be back to back so she only had to make one trip there.

The people Nick works with for the most part aren 't rich but do well enough so they can afford rent and have some disposable income. Nick also has some clients who are flat broke and save for months just to hire him.

This one rapper, a single mother who is gaining a following hired and paid Nick $500 to shoot a show. Nick had her sign a contract which clearly states his refund policy (must give a 72 hour notice for a full refund, 2 days for half refund and less than 48 hours is no refund and you must pay the entire amount agreed upon if not already paid upfront. This applies for any reason)

This woman canceled on Nick the day of the show because something was wrong with the venue (Nick called and verified, they had an electrical problem). She told Nick she wanted her money back. Nick was sympathetic and told her he wouldn 't refund her because Nick could have booked another event that day but he can give her a discount on the next show.

She flipped out. Basically said  'fuck the contract ' and that Nick needs to have sympathy and think of her child and that she could possibly be getting evicted from her apartment and has been eating ramen noodles for a month.

Now Nick hates being guilt tripped. She signed the contract, knew what she was getting into and knew Nick's refund policy. Nick doesn 't think he should have to forfeit $500 for the sake of a child that he has nothing to do with because of something that is not his fault.

Now she 's saying she 's gonna take Nick to court (she won 't even have the time to try filing the suit) Her friends are spamming Nick's Instagram with angry comments and Nick has even gotten some threats of violence. 2 other potential clients said they 're not gonna hire Nick anymore because he won 't sympathize with a single mother.

0,"WIBTA If Nick stops letting his siblings use his gaming set up? | Ok, so before Nick starts here is a bit of background. Nick got his gaming set up for his birthday mainly because his siblings didnt let him play what once was his Xbox. He got it about 4 months ago. It cost around �700 for the monitor, PC, keyboard and mouse.

At first when Nick got it he was the only one to use it, with his father also knowing the password incase he searched up anything suspicious. His brother (12) and sister (9) begged him to let them play but he decided to not share the password in hope that his dad wouldn't give into them either.

About a month passes up until Nick comes home after a night out with his mates to see his brother playing a game of his on his set up, luckily, nothing was ruined, however he was extremely annoyed that his dad allowed his brother to play the computer.

Nick had a chat with his dad and he assured him that he'd only let his brother play when he was out with his friends.

He reluctantly agreed to this, however only because his dad made him feel bad if he didn't, something alot of people do to him as they know he hates disappointing others.

This continues up until about 2 months ago where it seems his brother is getting addicted to it and begs him to play it even if he is using it. He told his brother to f*ck of and get his own, which led to him being banned for a week and his brother got to play it all he wanted.

The week ends and Nick comes back to a very laggy gaming set up. At first he though it was because it was cheap for a gaming set up, then considered it was possibly because his brother downloaded an apk of some game. In the end it was neither.

You see, during this week, his dad told his sister the password and she downloaded the one thing that f*cks up all computers. Roblox.

For anyone who isn't aware, this game causes alot of lagging when downloaded even when it's not running.

Nick's father is extremely controlling and even though Nick is 18 Nick still has to ask permission for nearly everything, including if Nick can go to the store or literally just across the yard to Nick's neighbor's. His controlling behavior didn't really bother Nick that much when Nick was younger because Nick was extremely introverted and didn't have friends at all, but in the last 2-3 years Nick met some incredible people who Nick is lucky to call Nick's friends and Nick changed as a person Nick became more talkative and more confident, however Nick started wishing Nick would spend more time with them especially because some of them don't even go to the same school as Nick and Nick doesn't get to see them at all.

And that's how the problem was created Nick would ask Nick's father if Nick could go hang out with Nick's friends and he wouldn't let Nick, mind you these were reasonable requests Nick would ask to go hang out with them at 3pm and Nick would promise to be back by 6pm but he still wouldn't let Nick, Nick's friends aren't bad company either none of them do drugs, they don't smoke and they don't even consume alcohol frequently, etc. So in order to spend more time with them Nick started lying Nick would say Nick was going to the library but wouldn't tell Nick was also meeting with a friend, or Nick would say Nick was going on a ride with Nick's motorcycle and Nick would park at Nick's boyfriend's house and hang out with him, just stuff like that. Nick would do this maybe once or twice on a good week.

As you may already guessed it Nick's father found out, there was a lot of screaming in the house, Nick got banned from going anywhere except to school and back home, Nick got called names, etc.

However, the family that lived above Nick moved out and was shortly after replaced by a young (mid 20s?) couple. The first time Nick saw them on the patio after they'd moved in, Nick said hello and introduced himself, the woman complimented Nick's dog and that was that. Later on that night, Nick decided to bring his (small) bong outside for a short while. At this point, Nick had heard them talking on their patio for a while, so Nick knew they were out there but Nick didn't think anything of it. Very shortly after Nick started smoking, one of them said something and they both started laughing and went inside. Nick thought ok whatever. But since then, every time Nick walks by and anyone's on the patio they'll ignore Nick when Nick waves, and whenever Nick goes on the patio while they're out there they immediately go inside (sometimes even when Nick isn't even going out to smoke, it's like they just don't want to be around to even risk it).

So it seems pretty obvious to Nick that the smoking bothers them, since their introduction was so positive and everything since has been really strange and icy. While Nick knows that Nick isn't breaking any rules (legal in Nick's state and confirmed with the apartment when Nick first moved in that it was a smoking community) and is allowed to do what Nick is doing, Nick kind of feels bad going out when Nick knows they've been outside enjoying a chat for a while.

0,"AITA for not telling Nick 's parents she switched degrees? | Going to try and keep this short! Recently, Nick switched from pursuing a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology to pursuing a M.S. in Environmental Science. There were many reasons behind this, but the biggest was that Nick was completely burnt out in her previous program. Nick only joined the program because she couldn 't find a job with her B.S. in Psych. Ever since Nick joined, however, Nick 's parents have been bragging to everyone that they have a daughter who 's getting a Ph.D.

When Nick switched, Nick didn 't tell them (Nick told them 2 days ago, right after Nick 's first semester started). There were a lot of reasons behind this. One, Nick wanted to make sure Nick started successfully and had gotten everything figured out. Two, Nick knew they would disapprove. Their favorite insult for Nick since Nick was a small kid is ""tree-hugging liberal hippie"" and they adamantly don 't believe that environmental science is a legitimate field. Nick actually wanted to pursue that as Nick 's undergraduate degree, but because they took out Parent PLUS loans for Nick and threatened to cut Nick off if Nick switched to that path (\~10k worth over 4 years, if that matters) Nick didn 't.

Nick let them know 2 days ago, just to keep them in the loop. They went absolutely nuts on Nick, saying that Nick should have informed them so that they could change Nick 's mind. There was also a lot of talk about how Nick has absolutely wasted Nick 's life (Nick is 24 right now), that Nick will never get a job, that Nick has turned into a nutjob, etc. Nick tried to reason with them that Nick had Nick 's reasons for hiding it, and that Nick had only just started the program. But every time Nick has tried to talk to them since they refuse to respond to Nick, and Nick 's sister has told Nick that they keep complaining about it at home.

He doesn 't work on base (there 's no gate or check point to get through) , so Nick 's store gets a lot of civilians, but the majority of the customers are military in uniform.

Today, Nick had just come on shift when one of his associates came back to the office to tell him that one of their regulars had come in and she was acting strange. She looked like she was falling asleep/phasing in and out of reality, and she had been walking around the store for like 30-45 minutes. This particular customer comes in fairly often, and she isn 't always the most polite customer, but she doesn 't cause trouble. She was in full uniform and obviously completely trashed on some sort of substance.

Nick learned from the morning supervisor that this customer had been passed out in her car in the lot all morning and when the morning supervisor had checked on her to make sure she was okay she drove off. This was the second time she had been to the store today, but she hadn 't come in before.

They let her leave the store because they can 't hold her if she doesn 't do anything wrong (like try to steal) but as soon as they saw her getting into her car they took down her plates and immediately called the military dispatch center. They notified them of her behavior and let them know that she was driving under the influence.

They immediately dispatched three or four cars to try to intercept her, but it turns out she didn 't get very far. Trying to get onto the nearest freeway ramp (which they can see out their store windows) she ran right into a pole.

Nick feels conflicted because they probably destroyed her career by reporting her behavior to the mp (military police) , but at the same time she was clearly not okay and they couldn 't stomach not reporting a danger on the road. Is Nick an asshole?",FALSE,FALSE,4,3,2,5,2,3,Authority,360

She's an atheist and honestly Nick couldn't care less. Nick is not too religious either and religion rarely comes. Nick doesn't really want to ""convert her"" or anything like that and they've already agreed to just let their kids choose whatever they want.

Anyways, they're visiting Nick's grandparents in India and Nick wanted to go around and see some famous temples. Nick took her to a few, but there's on major temple left. Nick doesn't want to specify which one for privacy reasons but from the way Nick is describing it Nick doesn't think it'll be too hard to figure out which one. Anyways, this temple only allows Orthodox Hindus entry. Nick has always wanted to visit it.

An argument started between Nick and her because she says that she wanted to go too. Nick explained to her that this wasn't possible because she was not a Hindu. She said she could ""pretend"" to be a Hindu for a short while but Nick told her Nick would not be comfortable with that as it is against the temple's rules. The place is meant for spiritual connection and she just wants to see the architecture. She got pretty mad and went on a rant about religion before ""giving in"" and saying that if she couldn't go Nick shouldn't either.

Nick thinks this is ridiculous. Nick has always wanted to go to this temple and Nick is allowed entry. She just wants to ""admire the architecture"", which is fine for most temples, and she's gone to plenty with Nick already, but for a temple which explicitly bars her from going she should follow the rules. As for her argument she's accused Nick of being bigoted and intolerant for supporting a temple which does not allow entry to non Hindus. Nick doesn't find anything wrong with this as it's explicitly a Hindu place of worship, but that's just Nick's opinion

Now obviously Nick didn't expect Mae to understand fully but Nick did expect Mae to eventually understand about sharing.

Not happening, Mae eventually shoved Jane because ""she isn't letting me have a go!""

Mae cried and threw herself on the floor, Mae even shoved her face into Nick's - which in Nick's house is completely unacceptable behaviour.

Mae got 5 minutes in time out.

Mae came back, same behaviour.

Mae even started trying to hurt Nick by clenching Nick's finger in her hand and scratching at Nick.

Mae *had* been up since 5am after falling asleep at 12am, nap time - Nick was only told this after asking Mae's mother about Mae's behaviour.

When Mae's mother arrived to pick Mae up Nick pointed out the scratches where Mae had shoved Nick's daughter and said ""Nick would appreciate next time Mae visits you tell Nick if Mae is tired, Nick wouldn't have put Mae in time out knowing Mae got so little sleep""

This flipped Mae's mother out and she went on about what an asshole Nick is for disciplining *her* baby and children shouldn't have times out, Nick'd know that had Nick asked.

The housing market is terrible in the city Nick lives in and it's nearly impossible for young people to buy a property. Nick managed to find a place that needed a lot of work done and Nick bought it as it was in a perfect area.

Nick paid the deposit in full, the mortgage is in Nick's name and Nick spent close to a year supervising or doing the work to make the house liveable. Nick's money, blood, sweat and quite a bit of tears have gone into Nick's home. Nick's GF on the other hand did not contribute anything to the house and doesn't believe/want to buy a house and is fine with renting a place forever. Furthermore she's not good with money so any savings she had are quickly spent.

Nick moved into the house earlier this year, before then Nick was living at his home. Nick and his GF discussed living together and Nick offered his GF to move in with Nick for free, she immediately asked whether her name would be on the deed and Nick said no. Nick has no problem with her living there for free but Nick has read too many horror stories of couples that have bought a house together and then broken up. Neither side budges and a house sale gets forced, Nick doesn't intend to sell Nick's house.

This led to an argument where she said something along the lines of Nick ""planning for their break-up"". Nick relented and then said if she wanted to co-own the house she needed to start paying a market-rate rent for half the property which is a lot more than she's currently paying and would take 75% of her wage.

So he sneaked out and once they found out they went to the police department after insulting him and made him talk to the police officer over the phone. They would rationalize their controlling behavior by saying that they wanted to protect him but he found them extremely disrespectful since they were not even protecting him from anything, their views on marijuana were based on the stereotype that all stoners are losers.

Eventually, he got so sick of it and whenever his parents would come tired and stressed from work he would argue with them not because he wanted to change their minds, but in order to apply more pressure to them and make them have a mental breakdown out of spite. He eventually stopped smoking weed because he didn't like it that much, he even threw his dab pen in the trash to prove to them that he was not addicted. They knew he smoked once in a while but they stopped harassing him since he had a 4.0 GPA in his first semester in college. It was too late by then, he had no respect for them and he would ignore most of their calls and texts for the entire semester out of spite which really hurt them but he had no remorse for them. He knew his parents loved him but had no respect for him, in their eyes he was just a depraved drug addict, and respect was the foundation of any relationship, love meant nothing to him if he was not being respected by someone, and so he would ignore them because he knew he could not change their mind but still wanted to punish them for it and force them to respect him by threatening to cut them off entirely when he was away for the semester.

1,"AITA for not giving his 17 year old any privacy or autonomy with the computer because he's consistently demonstrated he can't be trusted to use it responsibly? Nick doesn't think he is, Nick thinks he is being a good parent. | Nick is a father of 2 kids. His older daughter is in college and lives with them still. His younger one however is the rebellious and problem child that loves to wrangle out of his control.

At around 11 or so they found he discovered the dark side of the internet, and since then they've put parental controls and time restrictions on the computer. the doctor recommended limiting screen time and exposure because it could have negative health effects. (This is a doctor with an M.D., his advice outweighs anything his son has to say.)

This worked well for a while, but then multiple times he found a way around the filters and kept violating their rules of usage, and used the computer at night. Every time they took it away for a week and tightened the controls and there was a password. Everything went well for some time, until Nick checked the browsing history and found that he had violated the rules again, and was now going on troll and skeptic/atheist forums that perpetuate misinformation and aren't good for him.

This was also the time where he got his first gaming computer that Nick got from his coworker's son who moved away to college, so before giving this to him, they made sure that he couldn't bypass their restrictions. They put Windows controls on it that can't be bypassed. He also must fill out a form that logs his hours and what sites he goes on, because now there is a zero tolerance policy. He must report everything he does to them, because he's consistently shown he can't be trusted with any semblance of privacy or autonomy, so now Nick has imposed a policy similar to his work; everything must be transparent to the authority of the establishment, and if there's any pushback or resistance, there will be consequences. His computer is now out in the open so there's peer pressure to stay obedient. And he's limited to 2 hours a day and has to be off before 6pm so the blue light and radiation don't affect his sleep.

Around this time his son was 16 going on 17, and started to express discontent over their ""draconian"" rules and being monitored and controlled so much, because the controls often filter sites that are totally safe and locks him out in the middle of games, and when they are away he can't get the password to allow more time. Nick said that as long as he lives here then he will abide by the rules, and this inconvenience and restriction will teach him not to be so rebellious and deceitful. Plus Nick is paying for the internet and electricity, he has no right to complain. And time extensions will not be honored unless it's for homework, but if he wants to learn skills on Khan Academy, he's out of luck, use the time he has instead of playing games. There are people in China who are much less fortunate and more censored than him. Even if he pays for his own tech, it will still be locked down, because until he's 18 he doesn't own anything.

So, Nick has 3 kids with Nick's Ex. Nick's daughter (16) and Nick's two sons (14 & 9). Nick won't go into details about their divorce or relationship now. Just know Nick and Nick's Ex don't get along at all. Looking back now, Nick doesn't know what Nick saw in him at all. But that's irrelevant.

Nick and him have 50/50 custody. They're supposed to switch weeks with them. But recently Nick's daughter has decided that she doesn't want to do that anymore. Over the past 9 or 10 months she has insisted on spending more and more of Nick's time at Nick's ex's. It started with her just wanting to spend a day or two extra over but now Nick's lucky if Nick gets a full week with her a month. Nick's tried to be respectful and understanding (she has emotional issues). Nick's tried to talk to her about this multiple times but she just gets snippy and refuses to talk to Nick at all. Nick's ex is no help at all (as usual). Nick's tried to get him to help Nick understand but he just tells Nick that it's her choice and that he will remain out of it.

Like Nick said, Nick's put up with this, even with the huge headaches it's caused. Recently though, Nick's sons have also started to show interest in spending more time there as well. Well, last night Nick finally put his foot down.

Nick's daughter finally decided to come over to Nick's house, but when she came she said that she wanted to spend ALL her time with Nick's ex. She no longer wanted to stay with Nick at all. Nick demanded an explanation but she refused. She claims that she's ""old enough"" to make this choice and that she feels better living with Nick's Ex.

Well, Nick refused. Nick's been much more understanding then Nick's been required to be. Nick's let her break the court order for almost a year but Nick's done. Nick's done letting her and Nick's Ex disrespect him. So Nick told her that from now on she's following the schedule again and Nick won't let her spend more time at Nick's ex's than required.

Well, she melted down. Called Nick a bunch of things that if Nick had called Nick's mom Nick would not be here today. And locked herself in her room. Nick's oldest son said Nick over reacted and Nick almost got into an argument with him as well.

Nick got a long winded text from Nick's Ex as well calling Nick all sorts of bad things and saying Nick's an asshole. Nick talked with Nick's sister about it as well and even she says Nick's being a pad mother.

1,"AITA for Nick denying his wife a new kitchen? |  

Nick has been married for 8 years. They have 3 kids - aged 3 to 8. Nick and his wife live in a large 1980's house. When they bought it the plan and Nick's promise was to completely refurbish. They've done about half the house - thoroughly, but not too much in the last years b/c of lots of work, small kids.

Nick's wife now insists they refurbish the kitchen. The kitchen is now over 30 years old, originally very expensive but now shows its age. It is totally usable though, and in Nick's eyes it's not that bad, though Nick agrees it's not what they really want. But Nick doesn't want to fix the kitchen, not unconditionally.

She has a low income job, Nick is high income. She works 70%, Nick works well above 150%, many evenings, weekends. Nick pays 90% of their bills from his salary. The new kitchen will cost $100k+. This will be all up to Nick to pay. They've had a few rounds of redecorations earlier, with contractors, and even though they didn't do much of the actual work themselves - all the things like making plans and detailed decisions, dealing with contractors, buying materials, etc - Nick had to do it. She prefers to distance herself from these projects, just wants to ""get it done"" but doesn't want to be very involved in the ""doing"".

Furthermore, Nick's developed this feeling that she doesn't really deserve a new kitchen. She has no real interest in cooking dinner - and thinks that Nick should be the designated ""gourmet chef"" in the house. Dinner is usually just thrown together in 15 minutes. She has recently turned vegetarian, which Nick - a meat lover- is decidedly unhappy with. But even these new veggie meals are usually just the same goop as before - minus the meat. Nick can hardly remember 2 occacions where she made a well-planned and tasty meat meal for him. Otherwise, her dinner priorities is it has to be quick, for the kids, for her, and Nick just has to eat with his mouth shut.

So Nick's told her that she's not getting a new kitchen unless something changes. Nick wants her to gain interest in cooking. Nick wants at least once a week a meal of his liking. Nick wants the purpose for a new kitchen to get better food, not just something to show visitors. Nick wants her to more involved in the project itself, not just showing him pictures from magazines. Things like editing work plans, find serial numbers for items Nick must buy, and actually talk to contractors herself and not just through him.

She opposes this. Says Nick owes her and promised her this kitchen. She does most of the cooking anyway (Nick makes dinner 2 times a week), and if Nick's not happy Nick can just cook more himself. She must have something in return for all working nights and weekends where she has been left with the kids alone, and that Nick acts like a Scrooge. She feels unempowered since Nick has veto on major decisions. Since Nick's paying this and has to see it through, Nick feels it must be done on his terms.

They have a decent marriage, but this kitchen conflict has become sort of locked.

1,"AITA For refusing to help a colleague after they've messed up | So Nick works in the service industry and Nick has been with the same company for the last 4 years. Nick works at an event center where he collects dirty glasses, stocks up bars and helps out customers with everything they need.

We employ a lot a young people, think high school age. They work fridays and saturdays and rarely on  weekdays if there is a bigger event.

This season, a new girl, along with a couple other people, was hired. Nick will call her Kate. Kate is 17 and she tries really hard. She's great with customers, always has a smile on her face and you'll rarely hear her complain. Genuinely just a nice, hard working kid.

Now there are a lot of unspoken rules. Certain things have to be in certain places, even if there's no obvious reason for it, that sort of thing. We tell every new hiree about all of the rules and Nick makes sure they know they can always ask if they need help with something.

Recently, we started to notice certain things misplaced. We had a short meeting with all of the staff and Nick tried to get them to admit who it was. Not to punish them, but to explain why it had to be the other way. No one admited, which was fairly disappointing, but whatever. Nick explained the reason anyway, but we continued to find things in places they shouldn't be. Nick planned on setting up a meet with each of our staff individualy, hoping to resolve the issue.

Yesterday, Kate came to Nick because she couldn't find a crate of quite expensive wine (think $150/bottle). Nick told her to look where the wine would usually be, but it wasn't there. That's when she said she put the crate elsewhere the day before, because she tought it would be more accesible there, but that it isn't there anymore. Nick asked her where she put it and basically she put it where we put empty wine/alcohol bottles at the end of shifts (she didn't know this, because only Nick and another guy take out the empty bottles as they stay longer than everyone else).

Now Nick and his boss reviewed the footage and indeed, it showed her putting the wine there and 6 hours later, Nick and the other guy, collecting all the crates and taking them out (we stack them on a cart, so we didn't even notice the crate was heavy).

Now he wants her to pay $1500 out of pocket for the 10 bottles. She asked Nick to talk to him and explain that she didn't mean to do it. Nick told her he was sorry, but we had told every single staff member where things have to be placed and she still did it her own way, therefore he couldn't do anything to help her. She broke down crying.

Nick's girlfriend thinks Nick is an asshole, says that he could've talked to his boss and maybe work something out, such as take a portion of the money out of her paychecks every month. Nick's friends are mostly on his side, though some are saying he was a dick even though she sort of deserved it.

Nick uses programs outside of school hours as part of their school instruction and takes every opportunity as learning. On a whole they do much less work than other kids their age so when Nick tells them to do something she expects it done.?

Nick's 9-year-old is obsessed with books called The Magic Treehouse and they went to NYC today so she could see the author and get a picture with her.

Her younger sisters came with them but were not as interested and excited as she was.

During the program they asked the kids to practice writing a story and said for those that can't write they could draw a story. Nick told her 9-year-old she needed to write (she HATES writing assignments. She will write her own comics all day but screams and throws a fit with assigned writing.?

She started to pout and stomp during the program that she was not writing and she was drawing a picture. Nick told her she would regret it and that no matter what she would be doing writing today so please do this project now. She refused and sat there with her arms crossed.?

As Nick suspected after the writing time they allowed kids to stand up and read their story to Mary Pope Osborne. Nick's daughter started crying her eyes out and rushed into writing 2 horrible sentences and wanted to raise her hand to read. Nick put her hand on top of her daughter's and said ""no you did not do the work you rushed through this and have something incomprehensible you will not be reading now""

She started wailing. Not just crying but sobbing loudly.

Nick took her out and warned her to get herself together. Nick sent her to the bathroom to wash her face and told her she had 5 minutes to get herself together. She continued to cry louder. So Nick picked up her other children and they left. She was screaming crying on the way out about not getting a picture with the author.

Nick felt so torn. On one hand Nick could have just let her read her thrown together 2 sentences. She would have been happy and no one would have said anything. On the other hand she refused to listen and do the work in writing something even when Nick as her teacher/mom told her to do it 4 times and Nick doesn't feel bad work should be rewarded.?

There are only a handful of other women who teach here and the majority of them are in their 50s-60s. The other younger two are both obese. So for the most part, inappropriate attention from students really isn't an issue- Nick knows that sounds weird but it's something you have to look out for. You have to watch how you interact with students, how you dress, etc.

This past fall, for the first time in five years, a new female teacher joined them. Nick will call her J. J is 27, fresh out of college and very beautiful. However, she dresses very inappropriately for work: short dresses (above the knee), tight pants/skirts, low cut shirts, etc. It's not shockingly provocative, but it's obviously inappropriate for work. At first, some of the cattier women at work immediately jumped on her and constantly began making rude remarks towards her. Nick figured they were just jealous, so Nick took it upon herself to befriend her. Nick also figured someone would eventually speak to her about her outfits, so Nick kept her mouth shut. However, a the semester went on, her outfits got increasingly more provocative, so much that they all noticed. And of course with this came more snarky comments from coworkers and students beginning to talk.

Nick ended privately speaking with her boss, M, about the way J dresses. M is not a subtle guy and does not usually take people's feelings into consideration so when Nick spoke with him Nick made sure to explain that this was something that should be handled privately and delicately. He seemed like he understood but the next day during lunch when they were all on the same lunch break, M proceeded to tell J in front of everyone how inappropriate she was dressing and that it reflected poorly on their school. J left in tears. When it came out (and Nick doesn't how it did, but it did) that Nick was the one that reported her, all the female teachers accused Nick of slut shaming J because Nick was jealous of her. Nick found this sort of funny given how they had been treating her. The male teachers seem to be on Nick's side, however. It's completely split between guys and girls.

Nick doesn't whether or not this was the right way to have handled this- it was the most professional way Nick could think of. It was not Nick's intention to embarrass J but Nick did feel that her dressing the way she has wasn't appropriate for school- especially being around teenage boys all day.

About a month ago Nick was a restaurant with her husband of ten years celebrating his promotion at work. About halfway through their meal, a couple was seated at the table next to them. She was wearing a white dress and veil and he was in a suit so it's pretty obvious that they just eloped. They also looked extremely young to be getting married, but that's their choice so Nick didn't think much of it. Nick's husband congratulated them and they thanked Nick and her husband. They seemed very nice until Nick couldn't help but overhear the bride say to the groom something along the lines of: ""Hey, do you mind ordering my drink for me?""

This struck Nick as odd as most grown adults wouldn't ask someone else to order for them. The groom nodded and the bride got up to go to the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom, the waitress came and the groom ordered two beers. Something still seeming off to Nick, so when the bride returned Nick asked them how old they were. She is 19 and he is 21. So, she obviously isn't old enough to drink so he's buying it for her. After watching them have a few more drinks, Nick decided this wasn't right. Call Nick old fashioned, but Nick is very against underage drinking as it can do so much damage and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with that. Nick knows people who have ruined their's and other's lives over this and so when Nick sees it happen Nick does something about it. So, Nick reported it to the hostess who then came over to ask the bride for her ID. The bride said she didn't have it on her. They went back and forth for about a minute and it ended with the bride admitting she was 19. The hostess then asked them to leave as they don't allow people to drink underage. The hostess gave Nick a dirty look and Nick's husband asked if Nick had said something. When Nick told him Nick had, he got pissed off at Nick and said it was none of Nick's business to say something. Nick thinks Nick did the right thing as the bride shouldn't have been drinking underage and if she really wanted to drink they could've waited a year to get married. Besides, it's incredibly selfish and wrong to scam a restaurant that could also suffer major consequences for this.

He 's never hurt a soul, not even their 9lb cat, and he 's well known in the family as a clumsy, excitable oaf. He positively loves children, especially their 8 year old. The worst thing he 's ever done is lick people 's faces. Their little one is generally not as excited about pets and takes time to warm up to them.

They are both in their senior year of college. For story 's sake, we 'll call Nick's daughter Melody and her roommate Claudia.

When they moved in together at the beginning of the semester, Nick's daughter and Nick decided to make a roommate contract for them. Nick's husband and Nick make the monthly rent payment, and Claudia is responsible for sending Nick and her husband Claudia's half of the rent. Nick and her husband asked early on that Claudia send it within ten days before the end of the month to make sure everything 's in order (Claudia has been very good about sending it on time, even over holiday breaks, though she has been two days late a few times).

The roommate contract was not only to make sure rent was paid on time but also to outline cleaning duties and ensure the comfort of both Melody and Claudia. Here 's where things got sticky. Claudia has a boyfriend and Melody told Nick he 's been staying over at their place a couple nights a week. Melody and Nick were both uncomfortable because if Melody needed to leave her room when he was staying over, she 'd have to pass Claudia 's bed behind the divider in the living room and would sometimes hear him/see him. Because of that, Nick drafted up an addendum to the contract saying that he could only stay over a maximum of two nights a week including weekends and that Claudia had to inform Melody at least a few hours before he came over.

Nick thought this was completely reasonable. However, one week ago Claudia had her boyfriend over four times (DOUBLE what the girls agreed upon). Naturally, Melody was extremely upset and called Nick sobbing. Nick decided the only fair thing to do was to terminate Claudia 's part of the lease a month early. Nick gave Claudia two weeks to move out, which even then felt too long knowing Nick's daughter 's discomfort. Claudia also left the bathroom disgustingly dirty (multiple times)!

Nick is posting because Claudia and Claudia's parents have all reached out to Nick asking for more time. The girls ' lease isn 't up until March and Claudia isn 't moving into a new place until then, also Claudia claims she is taking the LSATs in just a few days and needs to study. Claudia's family lives several hours away by plane but Nick's daughter said Claudia 's talked about an uncle in their city, so it 's not like Claudia would be out on the streets.

1,"AITA for punishing Nick's daughter for wearing incorrect uniform at school? | Nick's daughter goes to a Catholic school. She 's gone there since she was in kindergarten, so her uniform is nothing new. However, this is her first year in the high school portion of the school. The high school admits a lot more students who aren 't necessarily religious, and Nick's daughter got mixed up with some new girls who are bad influences. She 's gotten in trouble at least once a month this school year for improper uniform, like rolling up her skirt so it 's too short, untucking and unbuttoning her shirt, taking off her blazer, wearing too much jewelry or makeup. Nick makes sure she has correct uniform before she leaves for school, but she changes how she wears her uniform when she 's out of Nick's site.

Nick has gotten sick of the phone calls from school, being forced to pick her up late due to after school detention and being forced to drive her to school on Saturdays for Saturday detention. The last straw was last week when she had two violations in a week.

This past weekend, Nick gave her the punishment of having to wear the proper uniform all weekend. They just did their normal routine over the weekend. They ran errands, they went for a walk, they went to church. Nick even treated her to brunch after church. She didn 't want to go to brunch while wearing the uniform, but Nick reminded her that this was her punishment for failing to wear the uniform properly at school. Nick even agreed to let her go to her friend 's house, as long as she wore the uniform, but she ultimately decided not to go since she didn 't want to go out with the uniform anymore. She got a couple of questioning looks while they were out, but nobody really said anything. One woman at church said it was nice to see a teenager so formal at church, which Nick thinks embarrassed Nick's daughter, but that was it.

Today, one of Nick's church friends later asked Nick why Nick's daughter was in uniform, so Nick explained the punishment, and she said that the punishment was too harsh and embarrassing. Yes, Nick's daughter was embarrassed, but that was part of the punishment. And it 's not like the outfit is embarrassing in and of itself. She wears this to school every day after all. And this isn 't even the first time she 's worn it on the weekend. She 's had to wear it to all those Saturday detentions she had.

1,"Was Nick the asshole for arguing with his wife over the fact that she keeps breaking their children's stuff | Nick and his wife have two children; a boy (Jay) and a girl (Leah). These are obviously not their real names. Jay is 12 and Leah is 15. So, Nick started this off by saying that he and his wife live a very comfortable life. Basically, they have worked hard their entire lives and got promoted till they got to this point where they make enough money to support a ""lavish"" lifestyle. Nick is merely mentioning this because he believes that this fact is the core of their problem.

What Nick meant by that was that their income is giving some leeway for their mom to break their stuff. She often breaks their stuff when they misbehave, spend too much time on them or get bad grades. Now Nick believes that there should be some sort of punishment for when these stuff happen. Taking their stuff away for a while would be an okay punishment. However, breaking their stuff is extreme and wasteful. Moreover, when Nick says their stuff, he is talking about Leah's phone (which costed a hair over $1000) and Jay's latest gaming console.

Lately, Jay and Leah have been doing a lot of things that irked their mother. So, yesterday their mother had reached her boiling point and she smashed Leah's phone by throwing it full force at the floor, and she cut Jay's PS4 cords. Nick supposed that Jay's predicament was far better than that of his sister, mostly since their mom didn't know how to break a PS4.

Nick was out when she had done all that. His kids told him once he arrived. He was annoyed. However, he stood by their mother's side and basically defended her actions. Once they were alone, he told her that she should stop breaking stuff.

She said that they deserve it and should start listening to her if they want to keep their stuff. Nick told her that she could've just taken them and hidden them somewhere. She said she didn't want them to have hope of having it back anytime soon. Basically Nick and his wife had argued on and on for an hour or so and hadn't reached any compromise yet.

Their mom does this about twice a year, and she ends up buying them their stuff back when they have fixed their act. It's also fair to mention that these outbursts are unplanned.

1,"AITA for not wanting Nick's wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than Nick? Nick knows the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut.

Nick's wife and Nick are fairly young (late 20's). Nick makes more than enough for them to live very comfortably on Nick's salary alone. Nick's wife works but makes less than half of what Nick does. They don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why they need to increase their earning potential.  
While Nick was getting his master's degree, Nick's wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support them as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. Nick thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.

Her parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, Nick thinks they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than Nick currently does.

Nick thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so Nick was a little taken aback when she told Nick how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked Nick what his thoughts were and Nick told her he wasn't sure if it was a good idea. Nick talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told Nick that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. Nick backed off but Nick thinks she could tell that Nick wasn't happy.

The real reason why Nick doesn't want her to pursue this option is because Nick has grown to like the fact that he's the breadwinner. It makes Nick feel good that he supports both of them financially. Honestly, Nick would feel emasculated if he made less than her. Nick knows that's an unpopular opinion but Nick doesn't think any guy can honestly say that he feels ""good enough"" for a woman that he makes less than.

A little back story before getting into the AITA part:

Nick's son isn 't biologically Nick's son. His father died when he was very young (6ish) and his mother was unfit to raise him. Nick's husband and Nick took him in and have been with him ever since. He was generally an excellent child. He 's given them endless joy and happiness. Recently though, he 's started to act out. At first it was small. Breaking curfew, lying, hanging out with questionables. They tried talking, because he is a straight A, chess club, football, beta club all around good kid.

It didn 't work. They tried grounding. Screaming. Listening. You name it they 've tried it. His misbehavior is only escalating though. He was caught smoking weed. (Nick knows weed isn 't huge and she 's always been open about that conversation but clear that he was expected to stay away until he was 18 an adult to make that decision.) He was involved in a hit and run. He was caught stealing.

This catches them up to their story now. In the middle of the night Nick gets a call from the police, again. This time, their son was caught tagging an abandoned house and had taken Nick's husband 's revolver from the safe.

He was charged for the gun and released to them. The officers were really great to them but Nick wishes they wouldn 't have been so cool in front of son.

Nick was livid and screamed at him, took away all of his privileges, anything Nick could think of and he still is treating it as a joke. He told Nick's SIL that he thought it was all funny.

Nick is really confused and hurt, son and Nick used to be so close. The three of them all have always been very close. Nick's husband and Nick feel as if their trust has been completely destroyed and that they 're losing their son.

For clarification purposes, she was in the girl scouts. Nick was not in the boy scouts. Nick tried to explain to his spouse last night after hearing the news of girls being allowed in the boy scouts that he no longer felt comfortable encouraging their young son to participate in the boy scouts now that girls were allowed in the boy scouts. It seemed like common sense to him. Girls go in the girl scouts, boys go in the boy scouts... hence the name GIRL scouts and BOY scouts. His spouse's explanation was that she quit the girl scouts because they didn't do cool stuff like the boy scouts and she feels as if girls should be allowed into the boy scouts. Nick explained to her that the coolness factor she spoke of was merely her perception as a bit of a tomboy as a youngster. In addition, while yes it is pretty cool to become an eagle scout, this coolness factor needed to be addressed in the higher management of the girl scouts and not just solved by blurring lines and pushing the girls that want to do cooler stuff into an organization that is already taxed by other recent changes and guidelines that are due to affect boy scout membership in a not so positive light. She assures Nick that his thinking is outdated and antiquated and that boys these days don't care if girls are in the girl scouts. Nick, on the other hand, views it as a matter of principle. Nick loves his spouse dearly and is trying hard to understand her point of view simply because they should be a united front, but he just is having an extremely difficult time getting past this very basic premise. Nick would truly appreciate views from males and females of all ages with or without experience in the girl and boys scouts and will take all opinions under advisement, because as of the time of this posting, Nick was still salty about their difference of opinion.

Nick had a trainee yesterday who was totally new to this; this was her first time ever riding with an ambulance, so Nick said clearly that she should be listening to everything he said and following his lead.

Nick and the trainee went to do an inter facility transfer for a guy who was basically just really sad and depressed, a transfer from the hospital to a mental health care facility. Nick warned the trainee that he didn 't like to talk too much to the mental health patients because they could be really unpredictable. Nick told her to just sit in the back, far away from him, and let him rest/sleep. They loaded him up and were driving. After he answered some basic questions and they were sitting, he was just talking to himself about how the roads were bad and he used to live in another state that was warmer and with better roads. The trainee, against Nick's instructions, started talking to him about living in the state. Yeah, the guy was pretty harmless it turned out and they just had a little friendly discussion, but she went specifically against what Nick told her to do. The rest of her work was fine Nick guessed, but Nick spoke to his partner privately about how she refused to follow his instructions and could have put him and herself at risk. Because of this, both Nick and his partner refused to sign her form saying she 'd completed the hours.

Nick got a call from the training academy that runs her program. The guy said there was no harm in what she 'd done, she was really upset, and couldn 't Nick just sign off so she could pass her class? Nick said no, that he wouldn 't be letting that go; she 'd disobeyed instructions that were for her own safety and it didn 't bode well for her future career.

Anyways, yesterday she was supposed to print out a memo she had written and she accidentally misgendered a client in the memo (who is trans). She caught this typo shortly after printing out the memo and putting it in everyone's box. She panicked, ran down to the mailroom and frantically pulled all the memos and then reprinted the memos and replaced them in everyone's box. Instead of just telling the boss, she did all this because this lady is exceptionally hard on her and she was afraid she might lose her job for this small mistake. The only person who had taken the original memo out of the box was another young girl and she ran to this girl's cubicle, asked her for the memo and replaced it with a new one and asked her not to tell the boss, which this girl promised not to. At lunch she went to staples and bought paper to replace the paper from the memo so the boss wouldn't catch all the missing paper.

He then sort of screamed at Nick saying ""I just looked over your answers as fast as you did them."" He then called Nick rude for acting bored and lazy in his class and for making fun of the work. He walked away, and Nick was kind of stunned. Nick didn't think Nick did anything wrong. He came by Nick's desk at the end of class and told Nick Nick and the teacher need to respect each other.

So, this week, Nick planted a 20 dollar bill before his daughter took her lunch money out. Sure enough, she took it.

Nick called the police and asked them to come with him to the school so that they could teach his daughter a lesson.

Her reasoning made sense Nick guessed so Nick let it slide but after a few weeks of this it *really* started to annoy Nick how her daughter just sits there doing whatever the hell she wants while Nick's other kids take turns working their ass off. So Nick went up to her daughter's room and told her that it was her turn to wash the pile. And she said  'what? You know I don 't ever leave my dishes. ' and Nick basically just told her too bad it 's her turn.

At this point Nick snapped at her and is having her wash duty for the next three weeks, starting now. Nick made her wash the dishes but she was clearly pissed the whole way through.

When they arrived, Nick's uncle picked them up from the airport and went to his house. When they got settled in he brought out a bottle of moonshine, 3 shit glasses and offered them a shot. They obliged but when she brought it to her face, she didn 't like the smell and didn 't take it. (She drinks alcohol, so it 's nothing new to her for taking shots) Sure the shot was horrible but these people live in poverty and this is gold to them, and she disrespected Nick's family for not taking it. So Nick pulled her aside to talk to her and was like, ' what did I say the only rule was before coming here, I don 't care if it 's gross, you just have to take one ' She started crying and calling him an asshole, so now Nick is here asking you guys, is he really the asshole?

She kept begging and begging as kids do and eventually Nick and Nick relented on the condition that she takes care of him. This includes feeding him, walking him, cleaning up after him, etc. Nick and Nick said this in no uncertain terms multiple times and ofcourse she agrees because she wants a dog.
