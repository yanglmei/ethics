0,"AITA for rejecting Nick's mom's dying wish to see him before she passes away? | Here is the background of the situation, Nick and his mom never had a good relationship to start off. Around the age of 14, Nick's mom and dad had a nasty divorce that ultimately split the family in half. Nick has 4 sisters, 2 older and 2 younger and he is the only son. Nick's sisters left with his mom and Nick decided to stay with his dad.

The reason Nick decided to stay with his father was because one night he came into his room just crying. Telling him he has no one else left in this world except him. That night Nick promised to be by his side no matter what and always be there for him. Nick could see that his mom hated him for choosing to stay with his father.

Skip a few years later and Nick is 17 and living with his father still. Over the years his father slowly started drinking his pain away and it took a toll on him and Nick. He became an abusive father telling Nick that he reminds him of “Her” which is his mom but Nick stayed because he loved his dad and he promised to be with him no matter what.

Nick tried to keep in touch with his sisters however his mom hated that idea. Nick felt like his mom brainwashed his sisters to hate him for choosing his dad over her but he didn’t care. Nick tried to talk to his sisters over the phone, drive to their place and hang out with them because they were still his family. Except one day Nick went over to his mom's house to see his sisters and his mom, however she pulled him aside privately telling him its best to stay away from them because he would bring his dad's influence and he won’t be a good role model to his younger sisters. She told him that she doesn’t want to see him around ever and to stop hanging around his sisters and that broke his heart.

A year later Nick turned 18, and things just got worse, his dad became more angrier with the world and Nick was scared everyday locking his room, sometimes he would just spend nights in his car just to get away because he was afraid of what he becomes when he drinks. One day Nick just couldn’t take it anymore, he decided to pack his things and just leave because he doesn’t have a family anymore. Nick asked one his online video game buddy who lived 4 states away from him, if he would take a stranger into his home. He told Nick that he is family and he welcomed him into his family.

The day Nick decided to leave he told his dad that he is leaving and he is never coming back. The look he gave him, Nick could tell his soul just dropped out of his body. He just looked dead. Nick packed what little he had and went into his car. Lastly, Nick went to his mom's house and she was there alone and his younger siblings were at school. Nick told her that he is leaving and he is not coming back to this f#cked up family. That day she asked him if he finally got tired of his dad's shit and just told him to she doesn’t want to see him either. Nick just felt disgusted and just depressed. Nick tried to a be a son to his mother and father, he tried to be a brother but he just couldn’t do it anymore. That day Nick left to his friends home driving 21 hours straight, just crying. Nick arrived at his friends house and a week later he got a call from his uncle that his father committed suicide. Nick was devastated and blamed himself for his death because he promised to never leave his side.

Years later Nick is 23, it has been 5 years and not once he received a call from his mom or his sisters about his whereabouts or how he is doing. They didn’t bother come looking for him, nothing. Except one day his younger sister found him on social media and texted him through Facebook. She told him mom had developed pancreatic cancer and doesn’t have much time left. Nick kept in contact with his younger sister because he still gave a damn about his family deep inside him. Nick would text her about how everyone is doing, especially how was mom doing. They exchange numbers and they would call each other here and there.

One day Nick got a call from his younger sister and it happened to be his own mother. She told him that she isn’t doing so good, she doesn’t know how much time she has left and apologizes for being a bad mother towards him. She told him she wishes she could see him one last time before she passes away and in that moment, what she said just destroyed him. Nick responded by telling her No, he won’t come see her and that this is what she wanted and he just hung up the phone. Days later Nick got a call from his younger sister telling him that mom passed away and was crying a lot and Nick is an asshole for not being there for his own mom, Nick told her that she doesn’t understand what he has been put through and Nick hasn’t talked to his younger sister ever since then.

TL: DR: Nick's mom’s dying wish was for him to come see her before she passes away, Nick told her no because of their past differences and his younger sisters tells him he is an asshole and hasn’t spoke to him since.",False,False,4,3,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,966
0,"AITA for not wanting Judy to live with her cousin after her mother passed away? | First of all sorry for the broken english, is not Judy's first language (F, 21).

On september of 2018 Judy's mom was diagnosed with stomachal cancer at stage four. The two of them lived in the capital of Judy's country, Judy is her only daughter and Judy's father passed away 19 years ago, since then Judy's mom was single and Judy's closer family, Judy's aunt and Judy's grandma, live four hours south of them. In the beginning they traveled once a month to see Judy's mom, they even spent christmas and new years with them that year, and it was great to feel the support of Judy's family at that time.

Sadly Judy's mom didn’t take her diagnosis really well and Judy had to start making decisions for the economic well being of the two of them, because cancer is a fucking expensive disease, such as having to move from a big and well located apartment to a smaller one in a modest part of the city that was just big enough to fit Judy's mom, Judy and a spare bed cause Judy thought they would come to visit, but in 2019 through all the period of time that Judy would go with her mom to chemos, hospitalized and everything Judy was alone with her.

They basically disappeared, Judy's grandma came to visit every 2 months but Judy's aunt literally disappeared, of course she would call Judy and tell Judy to go visit her but Judy was a nineteen year old woman taking care of her sick mother, the economy of the house and going to med school, so Judy didn’t have any time of energy to travel to visit her.
Through all this process Judy talked to them several times saying that Judy couldn’t do it alone but Judy's aunt told Judy that it was really difficult for her travel to see Judy. Even though they travelled to shop several times in the capital, coming for the day and didn’t even talking to Judy. Judy just got to know they were here because of social media.
By the end of the year Judy was exhausted, and was struggling so hard with her mental and physical health.

On december of 2019 Judy's mom passed away, and Judy started to take decisions such as with who Judy was going to live based on economic and personal things, and Judy decided to live with her boyfriend with whom Judy has been with for more than 3 years cause Judy doesn’t want to live alone. Judy is independent in terms of money since Judy got an insurance paid and Judy can sustain herself until Judy graduates med school.

But in January of this year, one month after Judy's mother passed away, Judy's aunt called Judy and asked Judy if Judy's cousin (M, 18) could live with Judy cause he is starting college in Judy's city, and Judy said no cause Judy doesn’t want to be in charge of someone after the year Judy has gone through, after feeling so alone and overwhelmed with everything.
After that answer Judy's aunt told Judy that it wasn’t going to be like that, that she didn’t want him to be alone, that Judy could teach him how to move around the city, and that sounded to Judy like taking care of someone and Judy stood with her decision of saying no.
Judy has seen her aunt a couple of times after that talk and recently Judy's aunt told Judy that she was really hurt by the decision Judy made because family is above Judy's boyfriend and stuff like that.

0,"AITA for not wanting to meet his moms boyfriend who was part of the reason his parents separated? | So this starts back in 2017 when his parents split (they were never married but had been together for around 25ish years) shortly after his 16th birthday. His parents hadn't had the best relationship for a couple years prior but Nick being a kid he never really noticed until he looks back on it now. His mom tells him that she's moving out and that they're not together anymore. Obviously this messed him up but he thinks deep down he knew it was coming. Anyways she moves out and he lives part time with each of them. It comes to his attention that part of the reason they separated was because his mom was seeing a guy who lived in hawaii (he lives on the East Coast US but his parents are both flight attendants) named David (not his actual name) and he was furious with his mom for this and he still doesn't fully forgive her for it. Couple months pass and during the summer his mom asks him to come to hawaii with her and his grandmother and he didn't really think much of it because he and his family go on vacations every summer since they get free flights since they work for an airline. They have a really good trip until his mom wants him to meet David and his daughters and he lost his shit. He told her flat out that he never wanted to meet him and that she knew that and that he fucking hated this guy for being part of the reason his parents split up. She was very upset by this and his grandmother was too, and his grandmother tells him that the whole trip was just a reason for him to go meet him and he was livid. Nick and his mother have had arguments over it a couple times after this and he basically says he never wants to meet him and she wants him to meet him because he is an important person in her life and she thinks he should be involved with that. Not much happens until late fall 2018 where she asks him to go to a wedding with her in California (he doesn't know the people getting married or anyone else going except his mother) and her boyfriend and his entire family would be there. She asks him for a while and he sort of lied and told her he couldn't go because he had a huge paper due that week that he was doing in school (which isn't untrue) and she was really upset by this. She kept asking him to go and he kept saying no and that he is not ready for that. His dad found out and he was upset about it and said that she shouldn't be making him go if he didn't want to (his parents don't talk at all anymore). His mom starts crying and saying stuff like she doesn't understand why he doesn't wanna go and that its important to her and he told her he would meet them eventually (which for the record he really hopes he doesn't have to). After the wedding she kept trying to guilt trip him by bringing him stuff back from California like some staff exclusive apple shirts (Davids brother works for apple) and she said if he would've went he would've been able to tour the apple HQ and got a free apple watch and that kind of stuff.

0,"AITA for not wanting to stay for 6 months with his mother while she is going through divorce? | (First time posting, will edit if there are any issues or if some points not understood)

So here is the basic situation, Nick (23M) lives in a city which is 6 hours away by bus but 1 hour flight away from his home.

This is Nick's last semester, so after one month he finishes his university studies. Now in the middle of the semester when Nick went back home for one week (like a winter break) on the first day a fight broke between his parents (48M) (44F) and apparently his dad had another woman in his life other than his mom (not the first time btw), and on that week all hell broke loose. within 2 weeks his mother wanted to separate quietly but his dad wanted custody and his mom didn't agree, so his mom files a law suit for the divorce and in this whole time his dad is denying all this and saying that his mother is hallucinating (but he doesn't know that his mother has evidence on him and not planning on telling him until the day of the hearing which really makes arguing impossible).

Now Nick is living in a lively city, its like the newyork of his country and he loves it, he just met a girl he is in love with and its been going great, he is taking latin dance lessons and it really helped him take his mind of all this, his friends are here, the job potential is better here, his workout routine is set here, his network is here, everything that matters to him and that he did through all these 4 years is here in this city, unlike his hometown.

Yesterday Nick calls his mother to check on her as always, and she immediately starts asking when he is coming back and says that when he does he needs to stay by her side to support her and that she needs a man by her side (he saw this coming eventually and whenever the topic started in the past he always implied that he is not coming back to stay). The period she wants him to stay is 6 months, until the summer or until his 17 year old sister finishes her university exam and gets into university, then they can all move to the city that he studied in. When he told her that that is not possible and he is not willing to stay for that much all the time, she started arguing how he is selfish, not thinking about her and what shes going through and that he is her eldest son and she did not raise him to be like that type of person. Nick doesn't believe that his mom is going to move to his city without his dad having a word about that for the custody of his little sister, and if she leaves alone, what about his sisters? he doesn't know what is going on through her head.

Nick is willing to go back every 2 weeks back home, and willing to bounce on a plane given the emergency.

He gets it his mother is going through a tough time, he needs to be by her side, that his father cheated on her and its devastating, he gets it that family matters and family must come first, but he doesn't want to live in all that negativity and stress for that long, he doesn't need it, he doesn't want it.

0,"WIBTA If Judy didn't let her homeless mom live with her? | So Judy (18F) is also homeless but Judy is currently living at a shelter, whereas Judy's mom (55F) couch surfs daily. Judy and her mom used to live at the shelter together (they moved in when Judy was 17 so Judy's mom was still Judy's guardian) but Judy turned 18 while there and Judy's mom got kicked out on multiple occasions for staying out past curfew due to drug use and now Judy's mom isn't allowed back in, at least for a while. This is not the first time Judy has been homeless under her mom's guardianship.

But Judy is now an adult, and there is a housing program that Judy is in for homeless youths that will pay Judy's rent for 8 months or so which will allow Judy to save up and get a job in that time so Judy can pay the rent once the allotted time is up. They just need to find a place that meets the program guidelines, and recently Judy's case worker told Judy she found one that would be perfect and that if Judy wanted, Judy's mom could stay with Judy. But Judy isn't sure Judy wants her mom to.

First of all, it's an efficiency/studio, so it's one room Judy and her mom would have to share: and Judy's mother is not an easy person to share a room with. Judy's mom would also essentially be living rent free, riding off of Judy's opportunity, while Judy's mom most likely spends her disability money on drugs. Judy also doesn't trust the people Judy's mom hangs out with; Judy's mom doubles as a dealer and in the last 3 months Judy has had people actively seeking Judy out because Judy's mom owed them money and even threatening to hurt Judy (can't put the actual details because this sub doesn't allow talk of that stuff). Judy has thought about maybe having Judy's mom give Judy Judy's mom's money so Judy could budget it and make sure Judy's mom doesn't spend it on bad stuff, and also only letting Judy's mom stay if Judy's mom was sober, but this is not an easy job, plus Judy's mom is very manipulative/Judy is a pushover. Judy also doesn't think Judy would have it in Judy to kick Judy's mom out if Judy found out Judy's mom relapsed either.

That being said, Judy's mom is Judy's mom and while Judy's mom hasn't been the best to Judy, Judy loves Judy's mom even though Judy doesn't like Judy's mom and Judy doesn't think it's fair of Judy to leave Judy's mom out on the streets/in the houses of fellow drug users. Judy feels like no matter where Judy's mom is living Judy's mom is going to use anyway, so Judy's mom might as well be somewhere safe. Judy's mom hasn't done the greatest job taking care of Judy, but Judy can't deny Judy's mom's good moments either. Judy knows that's a mom's job/the bare minimum Judy's mom was required to do, but still Judy feels like Judy owes something. Judy also must admit that Judy will barely be there because Judy spends 90% of Judy's time with Judy's boyfriend. Judy basically lives at his house, but not fully because Judy can't (he lives with his parents and Judy needs Judy's own space to come back to as an introvert), so Judy would rarely be present to deal with any problems Judy's mom may cause.

So would Judy be the asshole, given all this, if Judy didn't let Judy's mom live with Judy? Judy feels like on one hand Judy is looking out for Judy's own safety and well being but on the other, Judy could be preventing Judy's mom from being on the streets and it might not even affect Judy that much, but Judy doesn't know.",False,False,4,3,5,2,1,4,Loyalty,602
0,"Aita for not taking his brothers girlfriends daughter on a trip  
Nick is in his 50s and he and his wife of over 20 years have no children. They do enjoy kids and play the fun aunt and uncle to his brother and sisters kids. His siblings kids are younger. There’s 5 of them total ages ranging from 13-4. Nick loves them like they are his kids and his wife and he spend a lot of time with them. They also are pretty well off financially, so they love taking them to theme parks, downtown (their major city), and their vacation house.  

At the end of 2017, Nick's brother started to go through a very rough divorce, cheating involved. The kids have been very depressed and it sucks seeing the two of them carted around between their mom and dad. This year, Nick got a pretty nice bonus and decided his wife and he are going to take his brothers 2 kids and his sisters 3 kids to Disney World for a week. Nick is pretty excited as he is a Disney nerd himself. And the younger kids haven’t gone before so being there with them for their first time is an incredible feeling.  

At the end of 2018, Nick's brother has been dating again, and ended up finding someone he feels seriously about. They moved in together this past November. Nick has met her and she’s fine, she seems a little quiet for his brother but he seems happy and over the divorce so It’s all good. She has a 7 year old daughter who moved in with Nick's brother as well. He actually spends more time with the daughter of his girlfriend than his kids, since she spends all week there (dad not really In the picture) and his kids go there on the weekends. She is a sweet girl, but Nick has only been around her for more than just a hello probably twice. Apparently his oldest (the 13 year old) is annoyed with her, but she gets along really well with his youngest.  

Nick brought up the Disney vacation with his brother and sister and they are ecstatic. Nick extended the invites to them but neither of them are big on theme park vacations. So his brother asked Nick if he planned on taking (girlfriends daughter). Nick said honestly he was not planning on it. Nick explained that an extra child of that age would be too much for his wife and him to handle. And that his kids are still struggling with the separation, and having the child of their fathers new girlfriend on the trip might not be the best.  

He told Nick that it’s his money and he knows his kids will have fun so Nick can do what he wants. But he thinks that Nick is being an asshole. Because “he can afford it” and “they need to get to know her”. Nick snapped that he’s acting like this is his wife and he knows the child. Nick said this is a woman he has known for a little over a year and a kid that has lived with him for a few months.  

They haven’t talked since, his wife is saying that they should just take the daughter to avoid a problem with his brother. Nick does not want to. He would like this to be his own nieces and nephews in the wake of this divorce. He is not unwilling to get to know his girlfriend and kid, as he would like to and she is welcome to his home and all.

This year, at the end of March, Judy moved home and had nowhere to stay. Judy's sister and her fiance (let's call them S and F; also not engaged yet) have a spare room and let Judy stay with them in F's house. Judy was paying rent to them weekly. While there, Judy was living her own life - managing her own groceries, laundry, etc. If they decided to eat out, they would take turns paying.

A few days later, SF got engaged. S asked Judy to be her maid of honour for March 2020 after telling her that Judy didn't want to be part of another bridal party. Judy decided to do it for her even though they aren't close but she's family.

Judy gained her permanent residency around mid-May (a very big deal to her - been working towards this for the past 10 years) and decided to celebrate. Judy invited SF, her work mates and their respective partners to come for dinner. Everyone came along but SF. S said she didn't want to go because it will be so awkward for SF not knowing anyone.

Two days later, SF have their engagement party. Judy's parents are based overseas and Judy is the only immediate family member she has there. F has his parents and three sisters. All of them invite their friends along while Judy was not able to. Judy attended for S knowing that she will barely know any of the 100+ people there. Needless to say, Judy left after starting to feel uncomfortable when the familiar faces she knew retired early for the night. Hours later, Judy picked SF up from the pub (the afterparty) and dropped F's mates home as well.

Last night, Judy drove S to pick up F from the pub. F may have been drunk. On the way back, Judy took a turn too sharply and the rear wheel mounted the corner of a curb briefly. F proceeds to continuously carry on about how Judy is a dangerous driver. Judy pulls over and said if she was such a dangerous driver then he can get out of the car. F brings up the fact Judy is currently staying at his house and where else would she be if not there. Judy said she has people who she can stay with which he then proceeds to threaten saying it will be her last night there. He gets out of the car and walks the 500m back. Judy calls out to him to get back in the car but he kept on walking, so Judy drove off. On his walk back, he texts saying Judy is to be out of the house next week. This wasn't this first time F has threatened Judy with this. Judy was sick of constant insecurity of not having a place to stay and the lack of support from S that she packed a bag and left last night. Judy gets a text from F to come back as she was packing the car to leave, but nothing from S. Judy made the hour drive at 11pm to a colleague's place to stay until she can find a place of her own. They stayed up waiting for her and Judy was welcomed with a very warm hug.

As for today, Judy only received a text from S asking where she was and nothing from F.",False,False,4,3,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,594

Some info for context: Nick's (24m) father (55m) and Nick have had a very rocky relationship for a while. He skipped on court-ordered child support for Nick and his brothers (22m, 20m) for years and they pretty much had no contact from 2014-2019. In 2018, after they reached a settlement in Court, he started to pay CS again and gave them some land he had to cover the amount he didn't pay in the last four years (the land transfer was Nick's mother's idea)

Last year he reached out to Nick's brothers and Nick and they started a relationship with him (Nick's mother suggested that they talk to him to try and get him to pay more than what was decided on the settlement), however things went sour between him and Nick's brothers (as he paid child support after the deadline and ""fired"" Nick's brother that was - remotely - interning for him because his company wasn't doing well and he couldn't afford the extra costs), however Nick decided that he had no problem with him and kept the relationship going. Meanwhile Nick's relationship with his mother has been going from bad to worse, they fight constantly and she is very abusive towards him.

Well, last week Nick's father told him that he is coming to Nick's city (he lives 1250 miles away and comes for a week every month) invited Nick to dine alone with him on Tuesday (yesterday) and with Nick's boyfriend (23m) and Nick today (Wednesday), which Nick agreed to. He should add that his boyfriend is going a three-week trip on Saturday, so they did plan to see each other on today's dinner and tomorrow, also his boyfriend doesn't want to see Nick's mother for some time due to the way she has been treating Nick.

Today Nick received a text from his mother in the family whatsapp group saying that they're all going out to have dinner today to celebrate ""their families achievements"" (due to Nick's brothers recently getting paid internships), Nick then said that he couldn't today or tomorrow due to previous plans, but that he could every day from Friday and asked if they could reschedule.

She then asked what Nick was doing and Nick told her that he'd be staying over at his boyfriend's (which is true and he will) and couldn't reschedule because he wants to spend time with him before he travels (also true). No one said anything else, but then Nick's brother texted him angry saying that he knows Nick is going out with their father and not with his bf because their father invited him (Nick's brother) to come as well. He then told Nick's whole family what Nick was going to do and they are all furious with Nick that he is choosing his father over them and saying how he's ungrateful and that he is an awful person that this X Y and Z to them and how could Nick and etc. However they just sprung this dinner on Nick and he doesn't want to cancel on his dad AND ESPECIALLY he doesn't want to miss seeing his bf.

So F1 and Judy have known each other since middle school. But they really didn't start being friends till the end of high school. After high school they still hung out, and would go to a Resteraunt once a week and wait till F1's boyfriend got off work at 11pm. Probably would hang out till midnight or later. One day Judy locked her keys in the car and F1 and her boyfriend said they had to go and left Judy in the parking lot alone at midnight while Judy waited for her mom to bring her spare key.

After that they didn't talk for 2 or 3 years until F1 reached out asking if Judy could take her mom to her cancer appt. since F1 couldn't that day. So Judy did. They started hanging out again. Judy would sit with F1's mom on Judy's days off and take F1's mom to cancer appts. They were heading to pick up F1's grandma 10 hours away and asked if Judy could come to help (Plus give F1's mom her booster shots since F1 hates needles). Last year F1's mom died of her cancer and Judy was with F1 and her mom when she was taken off life support.

This last year Judy was with F1 once or twice a week. Helping F1 cleaning the house, painting, doing the estate, etc. F1 always said no one else would come help her, she has no friends around them, etc.

Well F1 is getting married. F1 told Judy Judy wouldn't be a bridesmaid because F1 didn't want Judy to work, but relax at her wedding (honestly Judy doesn't care about this. It's F1's wedding) and F1's having people she met at comic cons out of state be her bridesmaids. F1's cousin who is on the other side of the country, F1 hardly sees, is her maid of honor because she's married and knows how weddings go. Then F1 asked Judy a few days later if Judy would hold the marriage certificate and help the venue clean up after the ceremony and before the reception. Judy agreed.

But now F2 and Judy's mom found out and said Judy shouldn't. That F1 should've chosen Judy to be a braidsmaid if not maid of honor (again Judy doesn't care about this, they do). That being married isn't an excuse to choose someone for being maid of honor and reminded Judy she had been it twice (To F2 and another friend) and that Judy did good. Said F1 is taking advantage of Judy. That Judy has done so much for F1 (helped with her mom and grandma, helped her with housework and errands, got her mail when she's gone, been her emotional crutch this last year, etc) and F1 hasn't done anything for Judy. Judy tells them F1 has gotten Judy a lot of stuff from comic cons Judy can't go to because of work but they said that's F1's choice (because Judy doesn't ask F1 to and F1 just gets it and gives Judy them).

They said after all Judy has done for F1 and how Judy has supported her Judy should be a bridesmaid at least. That Judy should just say work refused to give Judy the day off.

0,"WIBTA if Nick didn't give his cousin the money from her graduation gift | Nick bought his little cousin a very nice and very generous piece of jewelry for her high school graduation a few weeks ago. Nick and his grandmother recently passed away, and had given him, as well as his sisters, the same item (a watch) for their high school graduations. So in his grandma's absence Nick gave her the watch, a simple and classic style Movado that set him back \~$500USD. It was significantly more than he had ever spent on a gift, but felt that this was an important occasion and this tradition was important in his family.

About a week ago Nick was checking his online banking, and noticed a chargeback on his card from the store for the full amount of the deposit (he financed the watch and would be making payments). Thinking it was a mistake, he called them and asked to speak to the manager. Wellll..... It turns out his cousin came in the very next day and returned the watch. The manager also added that the greeting card he had given with it was still in the bag and his cousin had left it behind asking if they wanted that back.

Nick felt so hurt. He didn't even know what to say. He felt hurt that she couldn't be honest with him about how she felt, he felt hurt she clearly didn't value his generosity, he felt hurt that she returned the item the next day.

Fast forward to yesterday: Nick's aunt called him up. She explained that his cousin had returned the watch as she felt uncomfortable with how much he had spent on her, and felt that she had no need for such a nice piece on jewelry in college. Nick said he was hurt but that he understood. His aunt proceeded to say that, however, she has a lot of things she needs like new clothes and dorm stuff and she could really use the money. She proceeds to say that she's talked to his cousin and it would be great if he could just Venmo her all of the money he spent on the watch.

Nick was so floored. If he had wanted to give her a cash gift he would have, but the only reason he spent that much money is because his sisters and he have all gotten that same watch from their Grandma and he didn't want her to feel hurt or left out. He thought it would be a nice surprise, but it was a lot for him and he had financed it, and it would be really financially uncomfortable for him to cough up such a large amount of money in one month. He let her know this.

Nick told all of that to his Aunt, and she proceeds to call him an Indian Giver and say that's disgusting, that he couldn't just not give his cousin a gift because she didn't want the watch, that he was ridiculous to give such an expensive piece of jewelry to a teenager, and that he should be proud of her for being responsible enough to want to spend the money on things that are more practical for her in this stage of her life. She said that it was incredibly tacky and selfish to get her so excited like this but then change his mind.

0,"Is Nick the Asshole for being difficult about a ""mandatory"" Monday meeting? | So just a heads up, Nick hasn't been on this subreddit almost at all, so if this doesn't fit/doesn't belong here please let him know and he'll edit/reupload/delete/whatever.

Nick works for a small, family-owned business (his family). He's been there for over 7 years now, through ups and downs, from the floor to an office he shares with the management types of the business. Things are extremely on the thin side right now, some of which was caused by his brother's management, but that's not part of this story. If they can get through the next little while, few months or so, things should be going extremely well for everyone involved. He's salaried and has been going in at 7:30-7:45am consistently for the past four or so years, working late if they need him, generally trying to be as supportive as he can, because, family. He's not saying he's a model employee, he's not. He makes his fair share of mistakes, he's not always motivated or disciplined, but the job that he does is one that only he can do, so he tends to be the first one overloaded.

Since Thursday, Nick's in-laws have been staying at his house. He loves these people - they're fun to be around, love to spend time together playing cards or cooking, his father-in-law is a whiskey guy and they always try to split a bottle when they get together. They live around 800 miles from his wife and him, so they don't see each other often, but when they do they try to make the most of the time they have, maybe a week at a shot 2-3 times a year. They're even kind enough to let them stay with them in Florida when they go on vacation - certainly people he'd like to keep on his good side.

All of this is leading up to this afternoon - Nick got a message from one of his coworkers, a guy he genuinely likes, informing him they have a meeting at 6:30am Monday morning that, quote, ""Isn't really optional"". Now he's not sure if this is a midwest thing, or just how he was raised, but they take goodbyes very seriously. It's considered rude to leave without saying goodbye, and even more rude to not be available if your guests are leaving. They're leaving tomorrow morning, right about the time he'd be in the middle of his meeting - something he personally doesn't find acceptable. The more he thinks about it, it comes down to the fact he wasn't informed about it until this afternoon - If he would have known about it Thursday or Friday, he could have planned for this and at least made a point of apologizing and trying to figure out how to make it work. He guesses to him it feels like they're not respecting him or his family's time, since none of the other three that will be there have significant others or any sort of other demands on their time. He's been digging in his heels and generally raising a stink, because again - he has family and guests to think about. He needs more than 18 hours of heads up to change plans. He realizes this may seem super petty, but he's really trying to get these people to understand how much their lack of planning causes issues for him.

0,"AITA for not wanting Judy's fiance to be friends with this girl | So Judy's boyfriend and Judy just got engaged, they been together over a year, live together, and have a dog together. They are very happy, but they have one issue in their relationship. He has a friend who he's been friends with since high school and she's a she.

Judy isn't upset she is a girl. But he was in love with her for years until Judy came into the pictures, they have never slept together, but have made out on several drunken nights. He says he is not in love with her anymore, and she always turned down his efforts to form a relationship with her in the past. But since they have been together, she has consistently shared things on social media about him. Pictures of them kissing each others cheeks, swimming together, and laying down together. They look really happy in their pics. He never really takes pictures with Judy, but they have millions. And she always shares them with some love quote, hearts, and recently a post stating that if they were single when they were 30 they would get married.

In the first few months of their relationship, she was ok with Judy in person but in several group chats with her and his friends has said mean stuff about Judy not belonging there, or just negative in general. He never replied or stood up for Judy, and when Judy got upset all his other friends got mad at Judy. When Judy asked why he didn't stand up for her he said it was because he didn't want his other friends being mad at him. This girl (who when she isn't around, all his friends and him don't even refer to her as a friend, calling her a ho and saying she is attention seeking) doesn't seem to care they are in a committed relationship. When Judy's bf finally confronted her about stuff, she finally backed off, but Judy still doesn't really trust her.

She invites just him to stuff, and later will say ""your gf can come too!"" if he brings Judy up. But it feels a bit like now that Judy's fiance isn't trying to get in her pants constantly she missed that attention. So now she's trying to get it back.

Whenever Judy asks why he is still friends with her when she publicly says stuff about Judy or when she post stuff about him and he doesn't say anything he always gives different excuses. Making it feel like she's more important to him than their relationship is.

Whenever she is brought up they fight. He doesn't see Judy's problem with her. He thinks Judy's being childish. But Judy knows how she is, because Judy used to be like her. She is attention seeking and Judy doesn't want him alone with her because of what she might do. He even wants her to come to their wedding, which makes Judy uncomfortable.

AITA if Judy's upset that her boyfriend consistently tries to be friends with a girl who is negative towards her and it starting fights? Judy gave an ultimatum that it's her or Judy. Is an ultimatum something Judy should feel okay about giving him. Judy just doesn't know what to do anymore. It feels like he never will really stand up for Judy, and that she will always be there posting cute stuff about him.",False,False,4,3,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,577
0,"AITA for Nick seeing family Nick's mother has denied Nick access to? | The title is very oversimplified so let Nick explain. Hang in there, because it's going to be a long explanation.

Up until Nick's parents got divorced, Nick had a great relationship with Nick's mother's side of the family. They'd come visit at least 4 times a year and Nick's family always went to Nick's grandmother's house in Florida over spring break. Seeing them was always Nick's favorite part of the year and there was never any issues with it.

Now, when Nick's parents got divorced Nick's mother decided she didn't want Nick and Nick's siblings to have any communication with her side of the family. She sent a lot of angry, untrue emails about Nick's dad to her side of the family, but they took Nick's dad's side. Nick's dad thought she was just angry because of that and would let up on it soon enough (she's known to make bad, rash decisions when upset). Keeping that in mind, he allowed her to put it in the divorce contract with the assumption that it would be dropped after a few weeks.

It's been almost 9 years and Nick misses his family. Nick hasn't seen any of Nick's mother's side, including Nick's grandparents, for almost a decade. But recently, Nick's dad took them on a vacation to Florida. Nick is almost at the age where the divorce contract will have no legal hold over Nick, so Nick went to visit Nick's grandmother (she lived nearby).

Nick has never been given a straight answer as to why Nick isn't allowed to see them. Nick's mother told Nick once that Nick wasn't allowed to see her sister because she was ""a heroin addict"" (totally not true) and that Nick's grandma ""called Nick a bitch"" (also not true and definitely not a reason to ex-communicate your family), so Nick has always been confused and thought that this rule was ridiculous. Nick's mother refuses to tell Nick the real reason why and Nick is beginning to believe she doesn't actually have a substantial one. Nick has never had a bad experience with anyone from her side, and Nick feels like that it's Nick's decision to make, especially seeing as it's basically to the point where Nick doesn't have to follow the contract anyway.

When they got back she asked if Nick had seen them and Nick said yes (Nick didn't want to lie to her) and she went ballistic. Nick understands that Nick went against her wishes, and Nick gets that it wasn't cool, but there was no reasoning behind why Nick couldn't. As Nick said before she's always changed the subject in a way that leads Nick to believe that she doesn't actually have a reason and it's just so she feels like she has power over Nick. So AITA?

Note: Nick has brought up changing the agreement on multiple occasions but always gets shut down. Nick is never given the chance to explain Nick's side. Nick never fought it too much because it would mean Nick would have to fight her in court, which Nick really doesn't want to do. She has a knack for cutting off contact with people who she gets angry at, especially if they didn't do anything wrong (ex. Nick's step-siblings that aren't allowed at her house) and going to court would definitely be cause to cut Nick off. She's still Nick's mother and Nick wants to be able to see her.",False,False,4,3,5,4,1,3,Loyalty,577
0,"WIBTA if Judy cancelled the friendship with her best friend because she is dating Judy's ex. | So, Judy would have to be brief here but she would provide info in the comments if necessary. Judy was currently rather confused about her own feelings and she would like to have some outside perspective on whether she was TA because of what she was planning to do next.

Judy's best friend, Kay, started dating Judy's ex Liam behind Judy's back. Liam and Judy dated for about nine months two and a half years ago and it wasn't a good relationship. He did not treat Judy particularly well and Kay knew about this. As Judy's confidante and best friend, Kay actually knew how bad Judy felt in that relationship until Judy broke it off. Judy wanted to make it clear that today her ex was not her problem, but Kay's actions were.

A few months ago, Kay started seeing Liam behind Judy's back. When Judy realised this was happening Judy started limiting contact with Kay. Kay noticed and started contacting a few of Judy's friends to talk about the whole situation and - according to Judy's friends - get validation for Kay's actions which apparently Kay even got from one of Judy's girlfriends. When Kay finally contacted Judy, Judy told Kay that Judy withdrew from Kay as a friend because Judy was hurt about Kay's actions. Now Reddit, Judy was fully aware that she didn't own her ex nor would Judy ever tell Kay who she had to date, it certainly wasn't up to Judy. But Judy was hurt over the fact that Kay started dating him without ever considering how it would make Judy feel, throwing the last bit of loyalty and integrity towards Judy out of the window and that's what Judy told Kay. Kay apologised for not being transparent and after this Kay just started to pretend everything was fine between them. Judy kept telling Kay that to Judy it wasn't and that Judy had lost trust in Kay.

In Judy's opinion Kay couldn't simply expect to date him and still maintain a friendship with Judy, even if that was what Kay so badly wanted. Judy felt Kay chose him over Judy and Judy had lost her confidante over this. Judy didn't want to stand in Kay's way, Judy had always wanted nothing but happiness for Kay. But Judy definitely didn't want to be a part of this. Judy was almost three months pregnant and Judy had to put her baby's and Judy's well-being first right now and Judy felt like she desperately needed to get away from the situation because it stressed Judy out so much. Judy thought the best way to do it for her was to cut contact and cancel the friendship so Judy wouldn't have to think about it ever again. Judy guessed by doing that, she would get a lot of shit from their common social circle which stressed Judy out even more because of Judy's upcoming wedding.

Judy didn't expect Kay to stop dating Judy's ex but Judy felt as Kay expected Judy to just pretend the whole situation didn't hurt Judy's feelings and wanted to reconcile the friendship. As Judy said, Judy was planning to cancel the friendship with Kay for good because Judy felt betrayed and all of this stressed Judy out to no end.

0,"WIBTA for telling a Friend's GF to cancel his suprise party? | So Nick's friend Tom(24m) is a little strange and struggles socially at times but Nick and their friends all love him dearly. The one time Tom really comes alive is when he hosts his dual Christmas and Birthday Party. Tom always seems very excited about this party and plans months in advance. Always fun games and trivia and it has become a staple of their friend group's holiday traditions. Nick thinks its important to note that this party ALWAYS takes place on Tom's actual birthday and it is always hosted at Tom's house.

This year Tom sent out an invite as usual and his birthday falls on a Sunday.

Maybe 2-3 days later Nick got another invitation from Tom's GF, Julie(19f). Its an invite for a surprise party. Nick thought this was a little weird but assumed it was a small event for close friends out at a bar.

Nick checked the Facebook invite though and saw that Julie had invited the entire party. Nick also noticed the location was set for Tom's house and the date was a DAY before Tom's actual party.

Nick was pretty confused at that point. Nick wasn't really sure what the point was in having a surprise party a day before Tom's event that Tom looks forward to every year. Nick was also worried that this change in plans would stress Tom.

Nick wasn't the only one confused as people on the invite list messaged Nick asking for clarity and eventually a group chat got started with their close friends on how to handle the situation.

They eventually decided it was probably best for Nick to message Julie and try to see if she would be willing make the surprise party a smaller event at a bar so Tom could still have his event as planned. They wrote up a very nice message to send that was supportive of Julie's idea while also firm that they thought this would step on the toes of Tom's party.

No dice, Julie completely ignored their carefully crafted message and told them that she thought Saturday would work better and they would do everything Tom had planned for sunday... on saturday. Nick tried to negotiate further but there was little budging.

At that point the groupchat was divided. Some just wanted as little conflict as possible and were willing to move mountains for Tom to make sure Tom was still socially comfortable and traditions were maintained. Others were wanting to boycott this party and viewed it as another power move from Julie which she is somewhat known for.

Nick saw both sides, Nick knew Tom would just want as little conflict as possible but Nick also knew Tom was someone who struggles to find confidence and this party is always an event where Tom is truly in control.

Its also become Nick's job to use the key Tom gave him to let everyone in to Tom's house. Nick was just feeling way too involved for something that he didn't fully support. Nick couldn't help but feel he should send Julie one last message with a more blunt tone. Nick thought it was rude for Julie to plan a party that overshadowed Toms and Nick did not make that clear in initial messages.

0,"AITA for euthanizing Nick's dog for a possibly curable issue? | On Wednesday morning Nick put his dog down voluntarily. Just four months ago another family dog had to be put down after struggling for months to try and treat his terminal cancer, which put Nick and his lower class family out $3,500 ish that they didn’t really have. He was not Nick's personal dog, though they all loved him. After watching his long, overly drawn out struggle Nick decided and agreed with his family that if either of his two girls got anything terminal and detrimental Nick would not pursue treatment. Anything minor they would treat it, but anything SERIOUS would be euthanasia. In all reality, Nick didn’t realize he’d have to make that call so soon.

Roughly two weeks ago, she dropped weight rapidly. A huge amount all the sudden. At first Nick thought it was because she was extremely old, but then he realized she was moving around less and having some trouble staying balanced. Everyone was a little worried so they decided to gather a few funds and then take her in for a check up.

On Tuesday night everything deteriorated. She suddenly was falling over and, once Nick actually saw it happen himself, he recognized it as a seizure. She began chugging water but then began to throw it up soon after.

The vet ran tests and it came back that not only had she developed diabetes, but she had gone into serious ketoacidosis. He said that a normal glucose level was 100, hers was 545. He explained that she had probably been diabetic for awhile and they just didn’t notice. The weight loss was her body breaking down fat to produce insulin, and the sudden severe illness was because her body was now attacking her organs for the same purpose.

Nick can’t even remember how he did the math, but the total just for the initial phase was somewhere in the ballpark of $2,000, then the monitoring would be up to $160, and then the annual cost. When Nick asked him how long she could have left, he asked Nick once more how old she was. She was anywhere from 13-17, not exactly sure. When Nick said that his response was “then she should have been dead five years ago”. There was a chance she could survive, but no promises.

After about an hour and a half at the vet, Nick made the final call to euthanize her without trying to stabilize.

Nick is struggling here. This is not the first pet he’s taken to be euthanized, but it’s the first one where he was the sole decision maker. This would also not have been Nick's first choice for pet he had to decide on. Her and Nick's other dog have been a bonded pair for 5+ years now, and Nick's still living girl is struggling. She looks for her and has already started moving around less. She is 13 years old herself with a lot of health issues and Nick worries this is a death sentence for her too. This dog was also Nick's best friends dog before she died a few years ago. Nick promised he would take care of her, and he feels like by euthanizing without first trying to fix the issue that he failed that promise.",False,False,4,2,5,1,1,3,Loyalty,556
0,"WIBTA if Nick confronted his friend about how her ""boss babe"" lifestyle is ruining her friendships? | Nick's friend, let’s call her Trisha, and Nick have been really close since they were both five years old. They are in their late twenties now. Nick and Trisha have gone through many life stages together, and even lived together during college. They haven’t always seen eye to eye but generally have a great time and really love each other.

Since graduation, Trisha has traveled all over the world, first supporting herself by teaching English and then eventually starting an online business. Nick doesn’t want to give too many details away, but think “boss babe” type business, lots of emojis on social media, etc. It’s not an MLM but her posts have the feel of that. Nick has had to unfollow her posts because he does find their frequency excessive and their tone grating, but he has tried to be a supportive friend and applaud her on how committed she is and how hard she’s been working.

Trisha has come back to their home country after being abroad for a year, and she has been talking about visiting Nick soon. Nick has told her that he is really looking forward to seeing her, but he does need to know well in advance when to expect a houseguest. She has never given him a straight answer regarding when she plans to visit. This is annoying. Nick has a full-time job and other pursuits and likes to plan in advance as much as possible.

Nick has been talking with some friends who live in the city that Trisha is currently in, and they’re all very frustrated with her. The friend who she is currently staying with has expressed anger and frustration that, despite her wishes, her home has appeared in Instagram videos of Trisha’s for her business. Another friend, Sally, is very upset that Trisha has been in town for a week and has not made any mention of it to her.

Nick feels like if Trisha wants to come visit him for a few days, he is expecting her to step away from her work and focus on catching up. Nick would be taking time off work and expecting her to do the same. Nick is also thinking of asking her to get a hotel or an Airbnb when she comes to see him, because he doesn’t want her filming in his apartment or sprawling out and making it into a home office. The idea of that stresses him out and makes him feel angry, he thinks because he resents her from being a really unresponsive friend all year (taking days to respond to messages then responding with one word, talking endlessly about “the biz” and how much money she’s making when they finally do get to talking, etc).

Anyway, WIBTA if Nick confronted her about how he thinks she is a workaholic and is being a terrible friend, and if he told her that she needs to either take time away from her work or rent an apartment or hotel she can use as her own personal office space? Is it okay for Nick to be upfront with her about how he thinks her relationship with her business pursuit is unhealthy, or would that be stepping over a line?",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,554
0,"AITA for ending Judy's friendship because Judy's best friend was a bridezilla? | So Judy's best friend (22f) was in an on-off relationship for several years. Judy never really liked her then boyfriend, and never really supported the relationship. The guy couldn't hold a job, and there were many times that she had to have 2 jobs to pay his portion of the bills. Then they broke up and she chased after some other guy, and when he ghosted her, she was suddenly engaged to the first guy and gave 3 months to plan the wedding. Judy was her MOH, and Judy lives a few states away from her. So Judy kept Judy's opinion of the wedding to herself. Judy offered to buy all the wedding favors, decorations, etc and she turned down every offer.

They got into several arguments because she said Judy wasn't helping like Judy should be, but being several states away, there was only so much Judy could do except for offer to help financially. And it honestly pissed Judy off that Judy was doing everything Judy possibly could and she still wasn't happy.

Fast forward, Judy goes down for the wedding with Judy's then 11 month old. Keep in mind that Judy drove 8 hours without Judy's husband, with an 11 month old, for this wedding. Judy stayed in town for a week so that Judy could do all the bridesmaids events. Judy was staying with Judy's parents, who still had to work. She was upset that Judy was bringing Judy's son to everything, but then was upset if Judy said Judy couldn't do something because Judy had Judy's kid. She genuinely was mad that Judy's family wasn't available to watch him so it really felt like a lose lose for Judy.

Bachelorette party rolls around, they were all pretty trashed. She thought Judy was passed out drunk and started trash talking Judy's husband. That was kinda the final straw for Judy. Judy has never trashed her now husband to anyone. He doesn't abuse her, doesn't call her names, so therefor it isn't Judy's place to say what Judy thinks. So Judy was extremely upset. And the whole party her friend was asking Judy weird questions that you just don't ask in everyday conversation. The questions made it very obvious that she had been talking about Judy.

Judy goes to the wedding, gives Judy's MOH speech, and stayed the entire reception, where Judy's kid wasn't allowed (kid free reception) but she wanted him to be a ring bearer (which is why Judy brought him out of town with Judy). That whole trip was hell on Judy physically and financially. So after all was said and done Judy decided to just quietly distance herself from her because Judy was so upset at how Judy had been treated for those 3 months.

She sent Judy a message asking why Judy has been so quiet and Judy told her that Judy thought she treated Judy really poorly and her saying that it was HER wedding was not an excuse to treat her best friend that way.

0,"AITA for choosing his S.O. of 10 years over his best friend of 12? | Nick is 40, gay. Friend is 53F, single. Nick will call her Prue.

Nick has never had a large circle of friends but he keeps many acquaintances. Prue is the opposite. Large group of friends and loves connecting people. They met at work 12 years ago. Hit it off quickly. They shared projects, helping propel their careers.

They've gone through a lot: Divorce, passing of parents and siblings, etc. Nick lived with her rent-free for 6 months. Early on, she introduced him to her circle of friends. 

About 2 years into their friendship, Nick met his SO. They were long-distance, so she met him intermittently, but liked him, introducing him to friends. They got along well enough that 5 years later, they travelled abroad together. Looking back, that's when Prue began judging Nick's SO. Nick thought talking about his relationship would make their friendship stronger. 

Prue had issues with current friends. Drama. But Nick's tolerance for that was low—that's when he noticed she brewed drama herself, saying things like ""..but I introduced them"",""they were my friends first""..

Fast forward to Nick living with Prue. SO came to visit (staying in the home). Prue comes home and finds he made dinner for her and him. She mistakes this act as exploiting her hospitality. She saw a ""mess in her kitchen"". A fight ensues and that's when Nick learns Prue has a silent loathing for his SO.

Two notes:

1. S.O. and Prue are in the same field. S.O. is more accomplished. This may play a role.
2. SO became good friends with ""Xiu"" from Prue's circle. Prue has a rocky relationship with her. 

3mos after the dinner debacle, things aired out but Nick is still stuck in the middle. Prue invites college friends to dinner. Nick goes to bed early 'cause he's not a big drinker. SO and the rest stay up. Next day, Prue says SO is conceited, ""he thinks he knows more than I do"". etc. This repeats, now Prue and SO can't be in the same room.

Note S.O. is as confused as him. He's sweet, loud, but not mean. He finds the situation sad, like losing a mentor.

Prue calls a meeting realizing their relationship is dicey. She makes SO cry. Nick states the absurdity of adults dealing with this. It works for a year.

Prue learns Xiu and SO's friendship has grown. She imagines gossip passing between them. Nick becomes acquaintances with Xiu too. During dinner with Prue Nick says he goes to game night with Xiu's partner. Now Prue turns on him.

""Oh so Xiu and you all.. you've been getting together without me?"" 

She has no idea Xiu isn't involved, but Nick doesn't correct her.

1mo later, Nick sees Prue at an event. He says ""Hi, how's it goin?"" No response. Not a look. Later, in an email thread started by Prue's friends, she sends S.O. a new message:

""Hi SO! How about you be yourself and fuck everything up like you always do!"" Nick semi-ghosts her.

This house is also Judy's childhood home and Judy's mother is getting older and needs the money from the house sale and needs someone to look after her. Judy's sister (40F) has been living rent free at Judy's mom's house until Judy decided to purchase half of it.

The half of the house Judy has bought is the second story and Judy is in the process of renovating so that it is a separate living unit from the first floor. It was agreed upon that Judy now fully owns the second floor as Judy has paid Judy's mom and is fully paying for the renovations. Judy's sister and Judy's mom said they would move out of their rooms on the second floor. Judy's mom would move downstairs and Judy's sister would temporarily relocate until the renovations are done and then Judy's sister will move back in to the 1st floor.

Judy gave notice to Judy's landlord and knew Judy had to move out on the 25th of March. Judy told Judy's mom and sister a month in advance about when Judy would move in. They were okay with that but made no move to get their things out of the second floor. March 25th comes around and Judy moves out of Judy's apartment and moves Judy's family's stuff in to the second floor. Lo and behold, Judy's sister's and Judy's mom's things were all still in all the cabinets and wardrobes.

Judy's mom has been saying things like ""I don't want your sister to feel like she's being kicked out of her own room, so don't push her to move her things.""

Fast forward to high school, Nick had found a solid group of friends and they would often party at each other’s houses. It was never anything too hard, maybe a few beers, but never anything much more. His mom has always been super chill, so their get togethers were often held at his place.

Eventually, word got around that they had a spacious backyard and it became the hot spot for high school partying. People beyond his general friend group were showing up to their parties. It was at this point that his mother met ‘Adam’. Adam was always a year ahead of him in high school (he graduated in ‘15, Nick graduated in ‘16). Nick had spoken to him before on few occasions but only considered him a mutual acquaintance.

One night, he and his mom got into a deep conversation and they apparently exchanged phone numbers. Adam moved away after he graduated to attend university, but they continued to secretly text one another. One night, his mother confessed all of this to him and told him that Adam was planning to move back after his freshmen year of college so that he could be closer to her. He would transfer to a closer university and finish his degree there. 

A few months later, Nick graduated and moved out of state to attend university himself. Adam indeed moved back to be closer to his mother and they announced they were officially dating. Nick was just ready to get the hell away from home at this point and not have to deal with what he figured was going to be a ‘fuck buddy’ ordeal. 

Angry at his mother, Nick decided to stop talking to her once he moved away. He would ignore her phone calls and simply respond with a short text to assure her everything was good. Eventually, she stopped calling and the only time they would connect was through the occasional text message.

Two years later, Adam proposed to his mother. Nick keeps in often touch with his younger siblings. They are now 18, 16, & 13 and keep him somewhat updated on their lives and their mothers relationship. They were all very disturbed by the relationship initially, but they’ve all seemed to have been brainwashed to jump on board with it. His sisters claim he’s a good guy who truly loves their mom. His brother is a bit more doubtful but he still seems to be generally accepting of it. Nick has tried telling them that it’s not a healthy relationship but they always brush him off, telling him they don’t want to anger or upset their mom. 

Long story short, they got married last month. His 46 year old mother is now the wife on his 22 year old former high school classmate. Nick did not attend the wedding and he has not spoken to her since September of 2016.",False,False,4,3,5,2,3,3,Loyalty,548
0,"AITA For skipping guy's night because the host's wife was there? |   

So Nick has a pretty tight group of friends that have all been together since elementary school. All early 30s now. Lately with people getting married and their careers they haven’t had much time to spend together. So one of his friends suggested a long overdue guy’s night. Just pizza and beers and catching up at a buddy’s place. Nick said that he would order and pay for the pizza from their usual spot.

So the day of guy’s night, Nick gets a text from the host’s wife (We’ll call her Kim), asking him to pick up some pizza on the other end of the city. At first Nick was confused and then he found out that she basically just cancelled her plans with her girlfriends to interject herself into their guy’s night. Nick told her that the place she wants to pick up from is on the other end of the city, plus they already had a place to order from. Kim had wanted to order a bunch of these super expensive, tiny thin-crust hipster pizzas. Nick tells Kim that they’re a bunch of dudes that just want some regular filling pepperoni pizza to eat while they have a few drinks. The host texts Nick after to just say, “Yeah, go ahead and just get the regular, its way easier.” So they go ahead and order the regular stuff. While Nick is driving to his place, he gets a message form Kim that reads something like the following:

“I think you’re being really selfish here. I wanted to share something with you guys that I found amazing and have a new experience with you, but you decided that you just have to make this all about yourself. You know that Host isn’t going to say no to anyone and you’re just being mean to get your way.”

Nick told Kim, “Just cancel the order, get whatever you want. I’m out” and turned around and drove back home. To clarify, Nick wasn’t upset about not getting his choice of food, but at the fact that Kim not only invited herself to what she knew was a guy’s night and then started making demands about food for them and telling him to pick up the food that she wants when she was also off of work at this time. Kim is a bit of a spoiled princess that’s used to getting everything she wants.

So Nick decided not to go, because if she was already getting this upset over something like pizza, then he doesn’t want to spend one of his nights off around her. None of the guys were upset, they wanted him to come but understood why he bailed. One last thing is they all hang out pretty regularly as a group anyways. So Kim sees them all once every week or so anyways. It's not that the guy's never get to see each-other, but they just haven't had a guy's only night in nearly a year.

Anyways after 3 years his aunt went back to Nicaragua because she did not like it here, Nick can count in one hand the amount of times he’s talked to her since she left. So the other day, Nick received a text message on WhatsApp from her asking him how he was, etc etc.... Nick responded to her and told her that he is currently at work that he won’t be able to text her back. She responded saying it’s fine, that they could talk later. An hour or so later she sent him a text saying that she’s been sick lately and that she doesn’t have the money to buy medicine due to the situation being tough back in Nicaragua, which Nick understands. Nick saw the text on his lock screen but he didn’t read it. Nick's boss who also uses WhatsApp sent him a couple of messages work related and Nick opened the app. Nick was still at work so he hadn’t responded to his aunt. 30 minutes later Nick got a text from her saying “Wow thank you so much nephew for having the courtesy to respond to me when I’m in need”. Now this really bothered Nick when it finally wrapped around his head. Nick didn’t mean not to reply to her, but he was obviously at work so he couldn’t get to her at the moment. Nick got home and explained the situation to his mom, she told him that she was going to talk to her, she also confirmed with him that she has been sick and Nick should probably send her the money. Nick was honestly very bothered by the fact that she sent that last message the way she did and he explained to his mom that he didn’t want to send her any money because of that and the fact that he hadn’t talked to her in so many years and the first time she reaches out to him is to ask him for something. Nick already sends a pretty decent amount of money to his grandma bi-weekly for her to be good over there. Nick also buys shoes, sends clothes, and money to his dad who also lives over there. So Nick sending money when he can is not a problem but he doesn’t like the way this situation unfolded. The only reason Nick is posting this here is because he got an argument with his mom because she believed Nick should send his aunt money because she brought him to this country and she needs help.

0,"AITA for saving money for Judy's parents instead of her boyfriend? | This one is a doozy, so bear with Judy. Throwaway for obvious reasons. TL;DR at the bottom.

**Relevant background:**

Judy (28F) and Judy's twin older brothers (33M) grew up poor. Judy's dad worked in a warehouse and Judy's mom worked a part-time job as an orderly at a psych hospital. Really rough, minimum-wage jobs. However Judy's siblings and Judy never felt poor. Judy's parents always made sure Judy and her brothers had food, a roof over their heads, got them into good schools and into after-school enrichment programs for free through sheer will power. They networked, begged, volunteered, whatever to give them a good upbringing. And it all worked out great for them: they all got full scholarships to top colleges and did well for themselves. Judy is a software engineer, Judy's brothers are a civil engineer and cardiologist respectively. Since they all make good money (150k+), they decided 4 years ago to each put money into an account (1k/month/person) and gift it to Judy's parents next year when they celebrate 35 years of marriage. They can use the money to retire and fulfill their life-long wish to buy an RV and travel the US. They plan to continue contributing to the account for as long as Judy's parents live.

**The AITA situation:**

Last year Judy got engaged to Judy's boyfriend of 3 years and they are getting married this summer. Recently they decided to merge their finances before their wedding. This makes most sense since Judy makes roughly 5x what Judy's fiance makes. When they were going over Judy's accounts, he saw the 1k recurring charge and Judy told him that money is going into Judy's parents' account monthly (he knew about this but didn't know how much). He thought Judy was joking and Judy was going to stop when they got married, Judy said no, that money is going to Judy's parents. He totally flipped, he accused Judy of putting Judy's parents before him and that he could use that money instead to complete his college degree. Judy told him Judy was more than happy to use their joint finances for his college degree but they would have to cut back on some things (like getting a new car, nice vacations, etc). This turned into a big fight which ended in him saying that they need to see a therapist to resolve Judy's ""unhealthy"" attachment to Judy's parents. Judy said no and he stormed off saying Judy is a big AH.

Judy thought this wouldn't be an issue: Judy's parents did a lot for Judy and they are getting older so Judy would like to repay them while Judy still can. Their friends have split opinions: some think that Judy is AH for not putting Judy's fiance's needs first and some think Judy is free to do as Judy pleases with some of Judy's hard earned money.

They are both in college, although she lives on campus at hers, which is about two hours away. Nick commutes to his school because it’s only fifteen minutes from home. They always *at least* text each other a “happy birthday” each year.

This year, Nick went around the house collecting some baby pictures of his sister and himself (and two of them included their older brother). Nick then made a collage of them and made a post to his sister on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday.

So this passed Monday, around 11 PM Nick was just scrolling through his texts to clear up space on his phone and saw she hadn’t texted him in awhile. Then Nick saw it was the same on Facebook and such. Nick's heart just kind of... broke. Nick didn’t know. Nick knows this all sounds very petty, but it did. So Nick texted her saying, “So like you never wished me happy birthday... what’s that all about?”

Her response was this: “? I could ask the same of you??”

Nick will show the rest of the conversation, her replies will be marked by the letter “H”.

Nick: “Nick did. Nick sent her a whole collage and then sent her a Jake [one of their dogs] pic on messenger. Nick went around the house for baby pics cuz 20 is the end of teens and all you know?”

Nick: “Nick isn’t angry and Nick can see why it can be misinterpreted as angry cuz he was just sending multiple texts but the multiple texts was to clarify when he had said happy birthday. And when he asked about why she didn’t say it it’s cuz Nick just felt weird about it that’s all.”

H: “She doesn’t necessarily think Nick is angry she just thinks that Nick has made something an issue just to have an issue because it’s late and the issue doesn’t really exist and Nick is just making up a reason to be resentful.”

Nick: “It’s just hurtful Nick guesses. It just showed Nick wasn’t on her mind enough to text a quick “hbd” at the very least is all Nick is trying to say.”

Her: “If it is so hurtful she doesn’t understand why Nick is mentioning it a week later that seems unfair.”

Nick has a best friend named Ian. Ian was Nick's roommate in college (they have graduated by now though), has been there for Nick through a lot of things, and is just generally a good guy. Since they both graduated college, Nick doesn’t get to see Ian as often anymore.

Ian has been dating a girl for about 8 months now, let’s call her Morgan. At first Nick was really happy for Ian because they seem so happy on social media and every time Nick talks to Ian, Ian has so many good things to say about her. It was a little annoying that Ian would bring her up in their conversations so often, but Nick was genuinely happy for Ian so Nick let it go.

By now, Nick has met Morgan maybe 4 times. Each time they hang out, Nick is in pure disbelief that she treats Nick's buddy with such blatant disrespect. She will tell Ian that his shirt is ugly and he should change, comments on what Ian orders and says he should watch his weight, curses loudly in public, interrupts Ian when he is speaking to Nick, and she is just generally unpleasant.

Nick wanted to like her so badly. After every bad experience with her, Nick told himself that she can’t possibly keep her attitude up, or that Nick's friend will soon realize that he deserves so much better than her. But they just get more and more serious as time goes on, and the other day Ian told Nick he was thinking about proposing when they go on vacation in a couple of months.

Nick knows that it’s not Nick's place, but Nick couldn’t hold it in any longer, and Nick finally told Ian what Nick thought of Morgan. Nick told Ian that she is rude, crass, and that it hurts to see how she treats Ian. Nick told Ian that Nick wanted Ian to be happy, but Nick doesn’t know if she would make Ian happy long term.

Nick should have seen this coming, but Ian flipped out at Nick. Ian said things to Nick that Nick never would have expected from Ian, and Nick told Ian Nick feels like Morgan’s bad attitude is rubbing off on Ian. Nick eventually apologized and Ian accepted Nick's apology, but things are still strained between them. Not to mention, Morgan has now deleted Nick as a friend on every social media platform, so Ian obviously told her what Nick said, thus ensuring that Morgan and Nick will never be able to be friends.

Nick feels really badly about the whole situation, but the way she treated Ian was borderline verbal abuse, and Nick couldn’t take it any longer.

Judy got pregnant pretty young and they stayed friends throughout this, however three weeks after Judy had her daughter Sarah sent her a long text telling her they couldn’t be friends anymore because Judy hardly talked to Sarah anymore and Judy treated Sarah's problems as if they weren’t important. (Judy had PPD and also found out her bf at the time was cheating, Sarah knew this, meanwhile Sarah's sister stole Sarah's favorite shirt or something).  
Anyways, when Judy's daughter was about 3 Sarah reached out and apologized and they became friends again. That lasted about a year. Last year Sarah decided to plan a surprise birthday party for her boyfriend on Judy's birthday. His birthday is like 2 weeks BEFORE Judy's. Judy sent Sarah a text saying she couldn’t go because it was her birthday and Judy had plans, Sarah replied with something kind of passive aggressive and Judy just didn’t reply because Judy was slightly annoyed but also busy at the time. A week later Judy texted Sarah about something unrelated and Sarah replied with a long text saying that because Judy ignored her (again a week), that Sarah doesn’t want to be Judy's friend and that her boyfriends party was planned before Judy's plans so Judy should have at least made an appearance because Sarah thought they were friends and that’s what friends do and that Sarah didn’t even remember it was Judy's birthday when she planned it on that day so Judy shouldn’t have left Sarah on read for a whole week over something so silly (according to Sarah).

This was Judy's first time posting Judy hoped it made sense.

So Judy and Judy's husband had been married for a year now. Judy and Judy's husband decided to skip the whole wedding and just elope as Judy's father passed away that year. Judy didn’t have any extended family but Judy's husband came from a very big and close knit family. (All of whom lived in a different country except Judy's husband's Aunty and uncle)
Judy only met them once before Judy and Judy's husband got married and immediately Judy realised Judy's husband's aunt didn’t want Judy's husband to get married.

After Judy and Judy's husband got married Judy's husband was supposed to move in with Judy but Judy's husband kept making excuses that Judy's husband didn’t just want to leave Judy's husband's auntys house that quickly because it would be rude. Judy agreed just to make things easy.
Fast forward a few months Judy's husband finally moved in. Judy thought this would be the beginning for Judy and Judy's husband to spend more time together. Judy and Judy's husband picked one day out of the week to be together usually a Wednesday which was Judy's husband's day off. Usually when the day came Judy's husband's Aunty and uncle called atleast 15 times telling Judy's husband to come over and every single time Judy's husband blew off any plans Judy's husband had with Judy to go to them.

Judy tried to be understanding that they were the only close family Judy's husband had here but Judy never got to spend any quality time with Judy's husband.
Judy's husband always made excuses when Judy's husband hadn’t seen them for a few days.

Even when Judy's husband talked to them on the phone Judy's husband gave them undivided attention. There had been occasions that Judy's husband's aunt or Judy's husband's aunt's husband called Judy's husband while Judy and Judy's husband were in bed and Judy's husband would get up to talk to them sometimes even leaving the room
but when Judy's husband was talking to Judy about something important Judy's husband was always on Judy's husband's phone or watching something and barely listened. This always resulted in a fight.

Judy grew up with family dinners so Judy tried to keep that tradition so Judy made sure that Judy and Judy's husband had dinner together every night. Judy's husband's Aunty had since started sending Judy's husband food in the day so that when Judy's husband came home Judy's husband had food to eat. Judy's husband stopped eating what Judy made because Judy's husband's aunt made Judy's husband traditional back home meals.

Judy and Judy's husband's marriage broke down fast Judy's husband stopped caring for Judy. When Judy found out Judy couldn’t have kids after years of trying Judy's husband left Judy crying in bed and was busy dealing with Judy's husband's auntys drama.

After consulting with Judy's family, doctors and Judy's partner, they decided for an abortion. Due to a recent health condition of Judy's that put Judy at risk, this was a choice made in regards to Judy's physical and mental health. Neither of them were ready for a baby regardless, so this was the right decision for the both of them.

Fortunately, despite this being the toughest decision of Judy's entire life, Judy's family, partner and close friends were very supportive.

Seeing as Judy was only 8 weeks pregnant, they opted for the medical route (abortion pills). After taking the second pill, you get sent home and have the induced miscarriage there. To make this painful experience as comfortable as possible, Judy's partner offered to book a beautiful hotel room near the clinic. (Judy's home was over an hour away)

Judy was touched by his thoughtfulness and told Judy's best friend, who hates Judy's partner, by the way. She wanted to join Judy in the hotel instead of him, to ‘support’ Judy.

She went on to say that Judy's partner should pay for a full spa treatment for the both of them. This comment caught Judy off-guard.

Judy wasn’t going to the hotel for a fun, fancy weekend, but to be close to the clinic and have a comfortable and clean environment. Aside from that, Judy's partner intended to be there for Judy and Judy *wanted* him there.

This made her upset. She said that Judy chose him over her, was dismissing her needs for relaxation (she was stressed from work) and was being selfish and narcissistic. Judy should always chose Judy's best friend over any man, she added. [Side Note: She was supportive 60% of the time, which Judy’s thankful for. But she also made remarks that it wasn’t that big of a deal, Judy's fear was unjustified and only in Judy's head, it wouldn’t hurt anyways, etc.]

It escalated a little, but ultimately the abortion took place and Judy went there with Judy's partner, not her. No spa treatments, by the way, just the most painful experience of Judy's life.

Afterwards, she kept bringing up that she should have been there instead of Judy's partner.

Cut to three months later and Nick's mum was diagnosed with cancer. It was a big thing, but they stayed strong and worked through it.

A month after this, Nick's mum found out that Nick's dad had been cheating on her. She came home one day and he was sat on the sofa covered in love bites. He wanted to be caught clearly, easier than having the hard conversation. Not only that, but he started cheating on her a week after she was diagnosed with cancer. He was actively looking - they found his online dating profile listing him as 'single', created a week after the diagnosis. He had decided to do this when Nick's mum needed him the most, and then spent all of his time with this new woman, refusing to take Nick's mum for her chemo or help around the house. He used the house like a hotel, stopping for food and sleep before he went back out with her.

Once he'd been caught he announced that this woman was the love of his life, and that he was excited to start his new life with his new family (she has two daughters). Nick's sister was understandably angry as he'd never really shown her much affection.

Since then Nick's dad had become this horrible person, telling people that Nick's mum was 'overexaggerating' the cancer for attention, and more. They also found out that he'd been using prostitutes for a number of years, and that he'd been fired from several jobs for stealing when he told them he'd moved jobs of his own volition.

She proceeded to explain that her wedding ring is worth $50,000 and Nick NEEDED to find the ring or she was going to call the police. They did a walk around the store again and Nick could not find it. Nick told her that again over the phone.

She then said Nick had to check every bodies pockets and bags including employees to see if any of them stole her ring. Nick told her this is a family business, every employee there is part of Nick's family and Nick is 100% sure none of them stole her rings. Nick also said he was not checking any of his customers bags or pockets and she could head down there and try and find it herself.

She said she was heading down there right now and after their phone call she was going to call the police. Nick told her she could go ahead and do that.

0,"Is Judy the asshole for getting upset that her SO called something her mom bought for her ""disgusting""? Judy's mom tried to commit suicide twice last year and Judy was the first person called to the hospital both times. Judy's mom is an alcoholic and Judy hasn't had the best relationship or upbringing with her but she is still Judy's mother and Judy loves her.

Yesterday Judy decided to clear out the apartment she and her SO have together. He had loads of junk in one of the cupboards, empty boxes and things he doesn't use anymore. However, when Judy was clearing she went through every box to make sure there were no wires or warranty stuff still in the boxes and if it looked important Judy asked if he wanted to bin or keep. There were a few things he wanted to keep and without question they went back into the closet.

However about an hour into it (when Judy was nearly done) her SO started to help and lifted the only thing of Judy's in the cupboard. A set of outdoor lights Judy's mom had bought for Judy in the summer, he asked Judy 3 times if Judy wanted to keep them so Judy said on the final time, ""Judy's mom bought them for Judy"" so he would understand to just drop it and keep them. But no. He decided to call them ""ugly"" and ""disgusting"" and that they should just throw them out. Judy silently started crying and went into the bathroom to gather herself.

Judy came out again and he was in the process of putting them in the bin and Judy said no Judy wants to keep them because they mean something to Judy, and that her ill mom had thought of Judy and bought them.

He proceeded to tell Judy they were ""disgusting"" again and said they were cheap and should just be thrown out. Judy got annoyed at this point because he kept going on about the lights. Judy told him that when she asked him if he wanted to keep XYZ she didn't question it.

So this ended up in a big argument that he doesn't seem to think was his fault. Judy only got angry after she told him her mom got them for Judy and he kept insisting they should be thrown out.

It was the only thing in the closet that Judy wanted to keep. He kept loads of things and Judy only wanted to keep one thing. Judy knows it's stupid but she cherishes the thought of her mom picking up the lights and being excited to give them to Judy.

0,"WIBTA if Nick said no to giving a discount to a friend for his engagement shoot? | Nick has a buddy, Anthony, who was one of Nick's closest friends since they were kids. Their small group has been very close for 7 or 8 years because none of them really grew up with supportive families. They would consult each other on everything, often times about more serious and intimate aspects of their lives. About a year ago Anthony suddenly stopped responding to messages and started avoided them. Their group is very candid with each other so after a couple months of this strange change in behavior, them reaching out, asking if Anthony was alright, they were frank and said it felt like Anthony was making himself pretty distant. Anthony appreciated their feedback and told them he'd make more of an effort to participate, and at least respond to them to let them know what's up and if he's okay.

After that Anthony would only ever really respond to them when it was about some kind of mundane topic. Others in their group would share incredibly personal parts of their lives and Anthony was noticeably absent, but someone sends a message about a new movie coming out and he'll chip in a message or two. It's not like they were going to force Anthony to participate, the situation just ultimately created a strange tension that has caused them all to drift a bit apart.

One day Anthony finally agreed to meet up with them and he announced he had split up with his longtime girlfriend and had already been dating someone else for a few weeks. It was such a big life change, Nick felt that Nick and others were a little cheated because they put so much trust into their friendship and it was clear Anthony didn't feel the same way.

Anthony continued not really being involved. A couple of their friends who live out of town stopped putting in effort cause Anthony never did, then it's just Nick and Nick's friend Eric left. The group will occasionally chat about big life events or updates, but it is slowing down. Nick guesses it's just the way life goes.

Nick hasn't heard from Anthony at all in a few months and Anthony messaged Nick out of the blue saying he is planning on getting engaged so he is wanting a discounted photography rate for the proposal.

&#x200B;

Jenny has been very up-front with Jake about what she expects from him, from day one. She wants to start a family, eventually stop working to be a stay-at-home mom, ect. She also expects him to be more mature than he has been, ie, no all-nighters drinking, no playing video games til 4 am, things that they did during college they shouldn't be doing anymore. She's also said, many times, she explicitly is not okay with him going to strip clubs. Her exact words on the subject were, ""If he went along for someone else's bachelor party, and didn't get any dances or anything, I *GUESS* I could be okay with it. But the second he's getting lap dances, I'm done.""

&#x200B;

Jake's bachelor party is coming up the first weekend in August. He's already expressed his explicit desire that, regardless of what they do during the day, every night he wants to get hammered, do drugs (marijuana at the least, but he's experimented with other substances before when drunk) and go to strip clubs.

Nick has 'grown up' a lot over the last year, and Nick has even realized that he's used Nick being a single bachelor as an excuse for doing things that upset his fiance, such as staying out drinking. He also talked Nick into going to strip clubs with him before Nick knew she wasn't okay with that happening. Nick realizes that, if one of his oldest friends bails on his bachelor party, it'll raise questions, and possibly make his fiance suspicious, which honestly, Nick would probably be okay with.

Nick has a very small family at this point which consists of a cousin Nick sees a couple of times a year, and Nick's mother and grandmother whom Nick lives with. Nick's fiance on the other hand has a very large family whom she is close with and they both see often. Nick has run into some problems where Nick's mother feels Nick has to do certain things in order for her to be happy.

For background Nick chose Nick's close friends daughters as Nick's flower girls, they were very excited. They maintain a close relationship with Nick even when Nick's work schedule intervenes, and Nick is very close with his daughters. Nick's mother on hearing this insisted Nick invite Nick's cousins daughters to be flower girls as well, telling Nick it would hurt Nick's cousins and her daughters feelings, as well as deeply upset Nick's mother. Nick's mother spent days crying and insisting Nick doesn't care about Nick's family at all. Sadly Nick sees Nick's cousin and her daughters only a couple of times a year despite an effort to keep in touch. Nick has little relations with Nick's cousins or her daughters at best. Nick's mother insisted and ultimately Nick felt guilty and gave in and asked them. They showed little excitement about the prospect of being Nick's flower girls and are unsure if they want to do it.

Fast foward and now Nick's mother is insisting that Nick invite Nick's great Aunt, with whom Nick has 0 relations and has only seen a few times in Nick's life. The same guilt trip is being pushed on Nick, how it will upset Nick's mother and grandmother and once again she claims it shows Nick ""Don't care about Nick's family."" Furthermore Nick's Great Aunt has difficulty walking at her age and would require Nick to invite Nick's 2nd cousin who unfortunately is very trashy and Nick does not want attending. This 2nd cousin has also never been a part of Nick's family life and Nick has met only a couple of times. Nick's mother has told Nick she's so upset that Nick should just remove all her friends because Nick ""Don't care about her anyway""

Nick used to be really close with Nick's cousin, and the three of them would hang out together all the time before they broke up. The reason they broke up was because she just randomly told Nick's best friend one night that she wants to breakup, and they weren't fighting, and she never voiced that she was having any issues with the relationship (they had been dating for 4 years at this point). Nick then learnt afterwards that the reason she broke up with Nick's best friend was because she started fooling around with a guy she worked with. Immediately after she broke up with Nick's best friend she spent the night at this guy's house all week (Nick used to live with Nick's cousin and her mother), brought him over to the house when she thought Nick wasn't home. She tried to keep this all a secret from Nick, and Nick immediately distanced himself from Nick's cousin and stopped really hanging out, and even talking to her.

Since then Nick moved in with Nick's best friend and they're renting a place. The other day Nick's cousin was texting Nick's best friend (her ex) saying she wants to talk. Nick's best friend said that he really doesn't want to see her at all. She then showed up uninvited to ""visit Nick's cousin"". Nick's best friend answered the door and it was very uncomfortable for him. Nick was in his room so he didn't hear it, but Nick's best friend texted Nick ""your cousin is here"". Nick was furious so he walked out and this is how the conversation went:

Nick: ""What are you doing here?""

Cousin: ""I'm just visiting""

Nick: ""Actually, I'm paying rent too, and I have the right to kick someone out of my house, so get the fuck out""

0,"AITA for wanting Judy's husband to be more open about their relationship? | Backstory: Judy's husband and Judy have been together for around 7 years. Last year they had a rough patch, and decided to get a divorce. During the divorce process Judy found out Judy was pregnant. (Was on birth control, and was told by doctors Judy was infertile because of medical reasons). After the pregnancy they decided to stay together and work on their relationship for the baby.

Fast forward until now. Judy is currently 36 weeks pregnant and expecting a little boy. Judy's husband and Judy have been working on their relationship and it has gotten a lot better. However, there is an issue that always comes up that they cant seem to get past. During their break he decided to start talking to one of his coworkers, everyone at his work knew they split and was accepting of it (even though they weren't legally divorced yet). After they decided to stay together, obviously all ties were cut with this woman. However, none of his coworkers know that he and Judy are still married or even know that he has a child on the way. This wouldn't bother Judy but he comes into Judy's work all the time to talk with Judy's boss and coworkers. Everyone knows Judy is still married and Judy cant hide Judy's belly obviously. It is complete opposite with him though. Judy is not allowed to come into his work, he never takes Judy out when he goes out with his coworkers. When he plays video games with his friends Judy cant be in the same room because he doesnt want them to here Judy. If they do go out, Judy is introduced as his friend. The only actual couple interaction they have had is at his brother's wedding where he introduced Judy as his wife.

Judy asked him about it and he told Judy that he hasn't told anyone because he doesnt want any backlash coming on to Judy or him from his ex or any of her friends at work. He says that he has only told the people that matter and no one else needs to know his personal life. However to Judy, it makes it seem like he is hiding Judy from his coworkers. It turns into a fight every time Judy asks him to make it public that they are together or even the fact he has a baby on the way.

Judy (31 F) & her children (2 F, 4 M) moved with Judy's husband (31 M) from where they met, married & had their children in California to Texas. They always said they would raise their kids in small town Texas where Judy's husband grew up. It was his dream & Judy was happy to support him!
When they moved – to a house a few blocks away from his parents – they thought they would be getting some help from his parents with the kids. They babysat the oldest twice in 8 months. They showed very little interest in the kids but had Judy's husband over multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health) & did come over to dinner a few times. He adored his parents & they adored him. Their only child. Their golden boy.

Judy's husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer that was terminal earlier in the year. He died within 5 weeks of diagnosis. It was tragic & Judy is still in shock. When he was dying he was in a great deal of pain & on morphine & wasn’t always coherent or thinking straight. However he told Judy his parents were devastated Judy would move the kids back to where Judy grew up in Canada & they wouldn’t be able to watch the kids grow up. Well…that was Judy's exact plan. Judy's parents are the most amazing grandparents & help Judy's sister out a lot (2 days a week of full babysitting!) & would do the same for Judy. Canada has a great education & healthcare system & Judy's siblings & parents live near each other so the kids and Judy would have a support network.

Judy lied to her husband. Judy told him Judy would stay & raise the kids as Texans as they had planned. He was in so much pain & distress & Judy couldn’t add to it. Judy chose the easy way out.

2 weeks after the funeral Judy moved her sweet babies home to Canada. Judy's parents in law are now telling everyone Judy betrayed a dying man’s last wish. Judy has told them they will visit every year & they are welcome to visit Judy in Canada whenever they wish. They don’t care – they said Judy has broken their family.

Judy's aunts still visited Judy a lot, and Judy visited them a lot, but this summer was the first time Judy stayed with them for a month straight.

Judy did a lot of stuff while visiting her aunts. One of them gave Judy a job at her bakery, and Judy loved helping and earning money.

Judy also felt like she got to know her aunts a lot better, and they told Judy a lot of stories about her dad which Judy never knew before.

Judy's aunts always told Judy that their door is always open for her, and that she is welcome any time. Judy told them that she wanted to move in with them, and they were thrilled. Then Judy told her grandparents and they were not thrilled, they seemed really upset. Judy didn’t really think about what it would mean for them if she moved out.

Judy is worried that her grandparents feel threatened by her aunts or something. Since they’re from different sides, they don’t really know each other, Judy is the only connection.

Judy's brother (28) just got back from deployment. For several years he had done his best to keep his distance from their family and not talked to any of them. 

Two days ago he turns up on her doorstep with his bags. Their mother passed a few years ago, her father a year before that, and no one heard from him during any of that. 

So he’s on her doorstep being happy and pretending he is just stopping in. Talking as if it hadn’t been nearly a decade. 
Then he tells her the place he was going to stay at fell through and he has no where to go. 

Now.. Judy lives in a two bedroom apartment. With her husband and two 5 year olds. Judy and her husband don’t have enough room for another person - let alone someone she doesn’t even really know anymore. 

Judy asked him if he needed money for a cab, or for her to check with some friends of hers to see if they could take on a renter. 
At the mention of him paying rent he loses his shit. He starts raising his voice and tensing his arms. Her husband stood up defensively (understandably in Judy's opinion). At which point her brother started to look like he was about to start a fight. 
Her husband used to be a police officer and he warned her brother to calm down or get out. 
After some yelling and some firm intimidation from her husband, her brother left, slamming the door on his way out, yelling about how Judy had never been a good sister. 

So here Judy is. She feels bad. But she feels stupid for feeling bad. Like. He verbally assaulted her husband and her, in her house, with her kids in the next room, after Judy and her husband offered to help. 
But a part of her is saying... he might have been in combat. He might not be seeing things right. Judy doesn’t know what he has gone through in the military in the last 8 or so years. 

TL;DR 
Judy's estranged brother got back from deployment and wanted a place to stay. Judy and her husband haven’t got the space but she offered to help find him somewhere. He got very angry and they kicked him out immediately. Now he likely doesn’t have anywhere to go at all. Judy feels bad.

They started telling Nick that Nick’s not trying hard enough, that Nick’s giving up, and telling Nick Nick should go to counseling and it’s Nick’s (now) ex to work on their problems. Nick left in tears because Nick felt cornered that they were ganging up on Nick. Nick was also told by Nick’s ex during one of their fights that they were talking to him, he was hanging out at their house (he worked close to them), and they were offering him a place to stay when they would fight. To Nick’s knowledge, they still communicate with him.

If it matters, Nick and Nick’s ex split because he was a liar (finances and criminal history mostly), played a victim, and used Nick as a crutch.

Since then Nick’s only been to their house for family gatherings where everyone is there. Nick doesn’t go to events with just them anymore, and frankly Nick doesn’t want to be around them. Nick realizes Nick doesn’t “own” Nick’s ex and they can have a relationship with him if they want, what Nick’s most upset about is they chose to believe his side of arguments over Nick’s after knowing him for only 2 years.

Judy didn't bring this up again with Judy's brother. A week ago, Judy's brother calls Judy and asks for a significant amount of money. Because of the current situation Judy's brother and his wife are out of work and they have a lot of loans and other bills to pay. Judy and Judy's husband couldn't give Judy's brother this amount of money without dipping into their savings. Normally Judy would have bit the bullet and after discussing with Judy's husband given Judy's brother as much as Judy and Judy's husband could. But now that Judy knows that if things get bad for Judy and Judy's husband, Judy's brother won't be there to help Judy, Judy isn't really motivated to help. Judy's brother got angry at Judy and accused Judy of refusing only because Judy's brother wouldn't take guardianship of the kids. Judy told Judy's brother that now that Judy knows that there may not be any back up if something happens to Judy and Judy's husband, Judy doesn't think it's a good idea for Judy and Judy's husband to make themselves financially unstable too.

0,"AITA for not hosting thanksgiving like Nick planned to | For about 50 years, Nick's mom hosted all of her children and grandchildren for thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. She’s now gotten too old and asked her kids to take over the tradition. There are 4 of them so they just rotate. They’ve each hosted one holiday so far. This thanksgiving was Nick's turn.

They had never spent thanksgiving or Christmas Eve with Nick's wife’s family. They’d just never been as close to them plus they live all over the country. Well this year Nick's wife’s mom and aunts decided to go to the Macy’s thanksgiving day parade. At first it was just a sister’s trip but then they decided to invite all their kids and grandkids to meet them up there.

Nick's wife really wanted to go. She hadnt seen some of her aunts and cousins in years. Their daughter wanted to go because it was a “once in a lifetime event” (which Nick agreed with). And Nick wanted to go.

As soon as they decided to go Nick called his older brother to see what they should do about thanksgiving because Nick couldn’t host that year. He said their oldest sister was going to be pissed and Nick had to tell her himself. He wished Nick luck.

So Nick called her and she was mad. She said she’d probably have to end up hosting even though she was up next for Christmas and Nick was being inconsiderate of what their mom asked them to do. “Mom wouldn’t abandon thanksgiving to go to nyc” and went on about how sad mom would be that Nick was doing this.

Nick offered to pay for them to rent a spot and have it catered but she said that took away from the close knit family vibe.

Nick's brother said his wife might be up for it but he didn’t sound too happy about asking her. Nick's other sister couldn’t do it because she was renovating her house.

Nick did feel bad for backing out of his turn but Nick tried to offer up solutions and Nick also offered to host the next holiday—which his oldest sister said no to because it was her turn and she’d been planning for it all year. Next up was Nick's brother so Nick said Nick and he could maybe just swap thanksgivings if his wife was up for it.

0,"AITA For Nick putting his foot down to his grandmother? | Bit of background: Nick's grandmother and grandfather were together since Nick's grandfathers death a few years ago, they had a very traditional relationship where Nick's grandfather controlled all finances, big decisions etc, and Nick's grandmother would do the cooking and cleaning (note: she has worked in the past and has helped when Nick's grandfather had his own buisness).

Ever since Nick's grandfather passed away, Nick's grandmother has been very reliant on Nick's mum and Nick (aunt/Nick's mum's sister isn't very nice and lives quite a distance away) which makes sense. Due to bereavement, her memory has gotten a bit worse but she's had medical tests and there's nothing permanent. She needs glasses and a hearing aid (but refuses to wear them). Nick loves his grandmother but Nick is more protective of his mum. Nick can see that his grandmother constantly relying on his mum to do everything for her (besides bathe her) is taking a toll. Nick's grandmother is competent but doesn't want to learn how to do anything Nick's grandfather did for her.

Now the event that leads Nick to ask AITA: recently, whenever Nick's mum has given his grandmother a time to arrive, she is always an hour to two hours early. Even if these times are 9:00am, she will arrive at 7:30am. Even if she writes the time down, no matter how many times Nick's mum or Nick himself tell her a time, she is always early. This used to be just a bit annoying but now she has started barging in when Nick's mum is with clients (Nick's mum is a mental health adviser) and doesn't understand why Nick's mum won't give her attention/hang out with her. Nick put his foot down and said that it's getting too much and is getting in the way of Nick's mums work. Grandmother's response is that they treat her horribly and she wants Nick's mum to quit her job. Nick tells her ""you need to be on time, check your phone or watch for the time. 15 minutes early is fine but an hour isn't! Nick's mum is working."" She asks ""what do you expect me to do?"" Nick says ""be on time"" and she then leaves.

0,"AITA for not calling Judy's pregnant friend after Judy lost her baby? | So last spring and summer Judy got pregnant. When Judy told her best friend Judy noticed that her spontanious reaction was not joy for Judy but jealousy. She found her footing after a while and pretended happy.
Some weeks later Judy and her friend spoke about her friend wanting to have children. Her friend then told Judy that she thought she couldn’t get pregnant. Judy asked some follow up questions to her friend's concern, had her friend and her friend's husband tried for long? Had her friend seen a doctor about it? And so on.
Turns out the answer was none of this, ”it was just a feeling” her friend said. So Judy said her friend couldn’t know before she tried and her friend got pissed at Judy. Judy decided not to bring up the matter again since it was obviously sensitive.
Later that summer Judy lost her baby late in the pregnancy. Of course Judy's life was a mess and Judy needed her friend. Her friend never called. Judy called her friend crying once and her friend had nothing to say. Some more weeks went by and Judy started to feel stronger. Her friend invited Judy over for coffee.
As Judy and her friend sat by her friend's dinner table her friend told Judy she was pregnant and almost half way through the pregnancy. This means her friend got pregnant right after she told Judy she thought she couldn’t get pregnant.
Her friend then started talking about all the issues she has with work and other stuff during the pregnancy. She showed no respect for Judy's situation at all.
Also, during all the years Judy and her friend had known each other Judy was always there for her friend. When boyfriends left her friend. When her friend's mum passed away. Judy's door was always open whenever her friend called Judy.
And now her friend did this to Judy. It felt as if her friend wanted to get back at Judy for becoming pregnant before her. Judy left her friend's house devestaded and crying.
Judy did not contact her friend after that for a while. Her friend then wrote to Judy and said she missed Judy. Judy replied that her friend had hurt Judy and that Judy had needed a break from her friend. Her friend never replied to this.

0,"AITA Nick's friend asked him to be her bridesman, but Nick bailed during the bridal shower and bachelorette party because he felt uncomfortable. | So last year, one of Nick's best friends got engaged. They had been close for years as best friends and Nick was thrilled for her. Nick did not know her fiance, but she wanted Nick at her wedding and asked if he would be one of her bridesmaids, or a bridesman if you will. Nick got a chuckle out of the idea, but he really wanted to be there for her more than anything because friends support friends. Nick also lives in a different city and state, and he wanted to see someone whom he does not see often. So Nick said yes.

Nick is the only man in the group and did not know the other women before. He still does not know everyone. But he went to the bridal shower this past weekend, and Nick felt very uncomfortable. This was his very first one, too, and did not have any idea of what he was getting into. Nick is shy and doesn't always take to people immediately, but he thought the people there were not terribly friendly. He also forgot a gift (Nick is an asshole there no doubt).

The first game was seeing who had the most unique items in their purse. That was followed by games such as who knew the most about the soon-to-be-bride and guessing if the groom or the bride did ""these things first"". Nick was the only man there and just felt very out of place. He learned that the bachelorette party was changing, and was going to involve a sleepover.

Nick felt so uncomfortable that he faked a sudden family event and left the party as the bridal party was getting ready to party. He didn't want to tell his friend/bride that he was uncomfortable and lied.

1,"AITA for confronting veterans Nick thinks are lying about their service or PTSD based on his own experiences? | Okay, so Nick is a veteran of 10 years. He was enlisted in the Marine Corps for 4 years and commissioned in the Army for 6. Nick is pretty laid back in a lot of things, but he can never ignore when someone tells obvious lies about their military service, and he feels compelled to confront them when they do.

Nick was not infantry in the Marines, but he served in an infantry unit for nearly 3 years, and he found that to be more in line with what he wanted to do. He got out, got his degree, and commissioned into the Army as an infantry officer, and got out as a Captain, which is when it stops being fun.

In Nick's time, he has seen a best friend bleeding out of his nose and mouth with 2 bullets in his lungs, knowing his kids were about to be orphaned by him and his wife would be a young widow (amazingly he loved, despite dying twice). Nick has been shot at, and blown up. He has had rockets fired at his base and when they were on patrol. Nick has known a 19 year old kid with the biggest grin who widowed his wife and orphaned his unborn child. He has known a young man who died after losing his lower half to an IED. He has known a brilliant friend who got taken out by small arms fire. And more than a few others who've gone the same way.

Whenever Nick and his wife are somewhere, be it a party, a restaurant, a store, wherever, and he hears someone talking about their service, he always listens in for the cliche key phrases. 95% of the time, it's a legitimate veteran, and he leaves it be and goes back to what he was doing, or they chat briefly about their time. 

Sometimes, however, Nick hears the phrases all of the liars seem to have learned in the same class. ""Oh, my job? They would tell me what to blow up, so I'd go blow it up."" That's not a job. ""I was a sniper, but I cant talk about it because so much was classified."" Then why'd you bring it up? ""I hung out with Special Forces so much they wound up taking me on missions."" Bull. Shit. 

Also, when they start talking about their supposed PTSD. Now, Nick has PTSD. He knows plenty of people ACTUALLY suffer from it. But a lot of people lie to create these movie scene quality breakdowns for attention. 

Whenever Nick is faced with someone doing this, he starts the usual litany of questions to let them talk themselves into a hole. Things like their unit, base, when they deployed, where they went, what their MOS was specifically, things like that. Usually, they start getting more and more vague, or they'll chuck out the ol' standby that most of what they did was classified. At a certain point, he will just say ""You're a fucking liar and everyone around you knows it now.""

Nick's wife thinks it is him being confrontational, and she doesn't call him an asshole, but she hates it. She thinks that he should just ignore it, and focus on other things. For Nick, it is because he sees someone claiming a false comradeship with a group of men and women that went through things they're only pretending to have gone through, and he hates it. To him, its disgustingly offensive, and he can't help it.

1,"AITA for telling Nick's step aunt that her “parents” are not her real parents? | Nick's mom married Nick's stepdad when Nick was 5. They would visit his parents every five years or so. Nick's step grandmother had 4 children with her first husband.

When she got remarried, Nick's stepdad and his brother were both in their late teens so they remember this situation very well. Since Nick wasn’t there, Nick will tell you the story from their POV.

When Nick's stepdad was about 17, his little sister who was 15 at the time, got pregnant. Nick's stepdad clearly remembers her being pregnant. Very early into the pregnancy, Nick's stepdad's sister was “sent away” and about 7 months later, she reappeared and magically Nick's step grandmother had a newborn baby with her new husband. From the moment that happened, obviously everyone knew that Nick's step aunt had had a baby and given it to Nick's step grandparents. But no one ever wanted to rock the boat and confront them. Also, years later Nick's aunt who had the baby wrote a letter to her other brother detailing what had happened and how sad she was about it. So there is no doubt that she gave the baby to Nick's step grandparents.

That child became what Nick knew to be Nick's step aunt who was only about 7 years older than Nick. In reality, she was Nick's step cousin. Nick along with Nick's siblings, cousins, everyone from that side of the family, grew up knowing the truth. Except for her.

Fast forward to 2008. Nick moved to NYC. Nick's step aunt happened to also move to NYC a year or so after Nick. They had never been super close due to the geographic distance between their families but Nick's parents encouraged Nick to text her and hang out due to being in the same city and also being so close in age. They instantly bonded. They had the same interest, the same sense of humor and rapidly became very good friends. Friends more than family. They hung out with each other weekly for the next 6 years. All along, Nick knew this deep, dark, horrible secret but Nick could never bring himself to tell her because Nick didn’t know what it would do to her.

In 2015, Nick left NYC and moved to Florida where she had grown up and where Nick's step grandparents resided. They also were not super close but due to Nick's extremely close friendship with Nick's step aunt, they started inviting Nick over frequently.

In January of this year, Nick was talking with Nick's step aunt on the phone. They stayed close even though Nick had moved away and would text or chat often. Nick finally decided that Nick had had enough of the lies and that if no one else in the family was going to tell her what they all knew, that Nick was going to do it, because she was Nick's friend. Nick's parents and close family from that side all supported what Nick had done and even spoke to Nick's step aunt to back up what Nick had told her with more detail.

Nick's step aunt on the other hand was enraged. She called Nick a liar and told Nick that what Nick did was beyond hurtful. Nick's step grandfather also called Nick a liar and asked why Nick wanted to hurt the family so much.

Needless to say, Nick hasn’t heard from Nick's aunt or her parents since this happened. And Nick keeps asking himself if Nick did the right thing.

1,"Nick’s girlfriend Judy threw out a box of things that belonged to her boyfriend’s former girlfriend. Judy and her boyfriend [28M] have been dating nearly 2 years. They moved in together last year.

From the ages of 20 to 25, he dated his previous GF. She broke up with him due to work and busy lives. That was her official excuse, but he told Judy that she was just “really afraid of settling down with me”. From what Judy gathered, she was his first love.

6 months after they broke up, Judy and her boyfriend started dating. At first Judy was apprehensive because his ex was this beautiful, gorgeous model. Judy voiced her insecurities to her boyfriend, but he promised Judy that he was ready to put her in the past. They even attended his ex's wedding recently. He was emotional and even tearing up, but nearly every guest was.

Judy’s boyfriend has a large walk in closet with his things. When Judy moved in, he let Judy use the spare room as a closet because his closet was full. Judy’s boyfriend is pretty neat but his closet gets messy fast. Due to work (and the weekly housekeeper being sick) he has no time to clean it, so Judy decided to clean it herself.

He’s never explicitly told Judy not to go inside his closet. Judy has been inside a few times, but mostly Judy has no reason to. Anyways, Judy got to organizing, and when Judy opened a drawer, Judy noticed a shoe box. It was pretty light for shoes so Judy opened it and found a nearly empty bottle of perfume, an old iPhone 4 with a cracked screen, a single mitten, and a lock of dark wavy hair.

The phone was nearly fully charged and could turn on. There was a passcode and the background image was a picture of a dog, which Judy recognized to be her boyfriend’s dog that his ex GF gifted him. And the hair was probably hers too. Judy had never felt more betrayed in her life. Judy took the phone out, put the box in a bag, and threw it down the trash chute.

When Judy’s boyfriend came home, Judy confronted him by showing him the phone. He looked bewildered and Judy told him how she found it. Judy asked him why he still had his ex’s phone. He told Judy that he had bought her the latest iphone one year for her birthday, so she no longer used the old phone, and he kept it instead. He admitted to charging it periodically, said he didnt want to “lose any of the old photos of my dog and stuff”. Bullshit, iCloud exists.

Anyways he asked Judy where the box is. Judy told him the rest looked like trash so Judy threw it out. He was livid. He yelled at Judy and said Judy had no business throwing out his belongings. Judy told him, “they’re not yours. They’re your ex-girlfriend’s.”

Judy told him Judy deserved an explanation as to why he still kept his ex’s shit. Evidently he keeps going back to the box because the phone is 65% charged and its an old IPHONE. Judy’s boyfriend admitted to smelling the perfume “once in a while” because the scent was “comforting and relaxing”. He says he is not reminded of her by it at all, its purely for platonic purposes.

Anyways, Judy has since been sleeping at her sister’s place. Judy asked if she was the asshole for throwing the box out? It was basically trash, and plus he is probably emotionally cheating on Judy by hanging on to “memories”.",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,597
1,"AITA for trying to give Nick's dog back to his last owner? | Throwaway because Nick's friends know his main account...

So. Nick’s 14.  They (Nick, his mom and brother) technically are the original owners of their dog.  He was Nick’s dad’s dog, Nick’s dad adopted him from the shelter about six years ago as a puppy. Nick’s dad tragically died two years ago.  When he died, he had a roommate/close friend who was really really attached to Nick’s dog.  She had been living  with Nick’s dad for a year up until he died. At the time Nick’s mom couldn’t keep Nick’s dog at her house because of her landlord, so Nick’s dad’s roommate kept the dog.  After a few months they tried to get him back after their landlord let them to have pets but the roommate REFUSED to give him back and had apparently register the dog in her name and took him to the vet and stuff and said he’s her dog now. They were all very upset because this dog is the last piece of Nick’s dad Nick has left. Nick’s mom called the police and told them the roommate technically stole their dog and they threatened to arrest her.  The roommate eventually gave in after fighting them for WEEKS because she decided she didn’t want to take them to court because she felt bad for them (Nick’s mom doesn’t have a lot of money and like come on Nick’s dad just effing died...) and so she gave them the dog back with all of his paperwork and everything.  But She was NOT kind about it at all.  Nick felt kind of bad because she was crying the whole time when they went to pick up Nick’s dog and she just said to take good care of him and Nick’s dog seemed to not want to leave.... But like he’s their dog. She only knew him for a year but he’s known them his whole life.

It’s been two years now and they’re moving and Nick’s mom just told them they can’t keep the dog.  Nick’s devastated. Nick found his dad’s old roommate on Facebook and begged her to take the dog back because no one can take him and Nick does NOT want to take him to the pound.  She blocked Nick.  Nick’s brother tried to message her too and she blocked him as well.  Nick’s aunt said that they are being terrible people and harassing this woman and that they have no idea what her situation is even though they are just trying to do what’s right for their dog. and this person literally almost took them to court for this dog and only gave in because she was trying to be sympathetic, so Nick doesn’t understand why she’s being this way now when she obviously cared about him enough to try to sue them for him.  Also, she had the dog registered in her name, so she’s responsible for him anyway. Nick’s mom agrees with Nick and his brother and they are considering calling animal services to see if there’s anyway they can force her to take the dog because they don’t want to just leave him at the pound. Nick’s aunt thinks this is a an f-ed up thing to do but Nick doesn’t agree.

A little back story:

Judy's a student right now and works part time but barely makes enough to pay her rent/school fees.

Nick is 24 and works a minimum wage + commission job, Nick has barely any money saved so Judy doesn't understand why Nick spends so much money/time with family.

They've been dating 3 years with no problems except for this, they love each other and live independent lives but Judy worries that Nick's too focused on helping Nick's family and making them happy instead of building a future for them. Judy's working as much as she can to pay her bills but because shes a student and also doing her required interning she can't work much more. Judy doesnt ever ask Nick for money to help her right now because she wants Nick to save up.

Judy doesn't have a family like Nick's so she doesn't understand, Nick's family is close and Nick really wants to take care of them. Judy says that Nick's supposed to be worrying about Nick's own future right now. Judy says that she doesn't understand because Nick's mom recently received about ~100k for a settlement and bought a house and a new car and Nick shouldn't be worrying about helping when they seem fine.

Judy is angry that Nick doesnt take Nick's life seriously, Nick's been trying to get Nick's real estate license for a few months now but cant find the time to study because of how demanding Nick's family is, they get really angry/sad when Nick's not around for family events and Nick understands why, they're a close family. Nick gets where Judy's coming from but Nick cant drop Nick's family. Nick told Judy all of this and she got angry saying that shes not asking Nick to abandon Nick's family, she just wants to make sure they have a solid foundation before they worry about helping Nick's family. And Nick cant build a future if Nick's always with them.

Judy expects Nick to start saving up money for a downpayment on a house while she finishes and gets her degree and can start helping as well but Nick keeps telling Judy Nick's family needs Nick first.

They had a particularly heated fight, the worst they've ever had last night and Judy said she feels like Nick'll never care enough about Nick's future and Nick's supposed to be building one for Nick and her and she can't be with someone like that. Judy said if Nick really feels like helping Nick's family comes before Nick's own future than that is Nick's choice but she's going to have no choice but to worry about herself from now on and plan a future where shes her only priority because Nick makes it sound like Nick doesn't want to be part of it.

Judy's stopped mentioning anything about it and is now talking about saving up for a one bedroom apartment and a car for herself (she lives in a basement). She seems so sad but Nick cant help but feel like Judy's wrong for even asking Nick to not help Nick's family.

1,"AITA - Judy's daughter is replacing her with her half-sister | Judy has always had trouble with her eldest daughter, ""Alice"". Alice was a difficult child, and is now a difficult adult of 22. Alice has a son of 18 months, Theo, and another baby on the way, she says by the same man. Judy has her doubts. Alice works in a call centre, and says she's management. Judy also doubts this. Alice is also living with her half-sister from Judy's late husband's first marriage, and Alice is pushing Judy away, allowing her half-sister to replace Judy.

Sarah, (half-sister), is much older than Alice. Judy's husband was a bit older than Judy, and Judy is only a few years older than Sarah. Judy won't go into the details of her husband's first marriage, but it was not a happy one, and when he divorced his first wife, Sarah took it very hard, and still bears a grudge against Judy to this day, despite the fact that Judy's husband's ex wife died many years ago.

Growing up, Alice and Sarah didn't have much contact. Sarah distanced herself from Judy's husband, and refused to be a part of his life. Sarah didn't even meet Alice until Alice was a teenager. Alice has always fancied herself a martyr, and Judy has always been Alice's favourite target for this. Alice makes up elaborate stories about her childhood, designed to make Judy look like a bad person.

Alice left home at 18. Judy always offered Alice a place in the family home, but Alice always refused, rudely. Judy recently found out that Alice is now living with Sarah and Sarah's husband, and is acting like they are her parents! Alice won't let Judy see Theo, but Alice is always rubbing it in Judy's face how well Theo and Sarah get on. Alice posted a picture to facebook of Sarah and Theo with the caption ""Theo and Yera (rhymes with Sarah)"", which is far too close to a ""granny"" nickname for Judy. Sarah is NOT Theo's grandmother. Judy is. It will confuse him, and that's not fair.

Judy has tried speaking to Alice about it, but Alice is unreasonable. Alice just says that Judy wasn't much of a mother to her, and that Sarah is more supportive. Alice also threw it in Judy's face that Judy doesn't get to see either of Judy's eldest son's children, either. Judy's son and Judy get along wonderfully, but the mothers of his children are odd, unpleasant girls, and won't let Judy have contact with her grandchildren unless Judy jumps through their ridiculous hoops, which Judy refuses to do.

Judy told Alice that Alice was being ridiculous, and that Alice needs to grow up and treat Judy with respect, and come home immediately. Judy told Sarah that Sarah was being immature as always, and that Sarah's past problems with Judy don't entitle Sarah to drive a wedge between Judy and her daughter. Sarah just ignored Judy, but Alice became even more dramatic, and started putting even more pictures of Theo and Sarah on social media, which hurt Judy terribly.

So Judy has to ask, is she in the wrong? Judy is hurting so badly, and Alice doesn't seem to care. Alice can't seem to see that Sarah doesn't want Alice to be happy, Sarah just wants Judy to be unhappy, and Alice doesn't notice that it's working.",False,False,4,3,5,4,2,3,Loyalty,578

&#x200B;

It was during exam period for university. 3 days before Nick's first exam, they went on a casual date to the local mall. Nick thought it would be good to meet up and release some of their stress. They had Chinese noodles for lunch. While eating, they got talking. Nick was telling her about a YouTube video he watched the other day. It was an informative speech made by a psychologist about cheating. The psychologist explained most cheaters don't go out of their way to cheat. And when it happens, most people are surprised they're doing it themselves. It's almost unexpected. She also explained how cheating has existed for a very long time where people probably won't be able to get rid of it as a social condition. Nick felt he learned a different perspective of cheating and thought to share this to his gf at the time. Nick didn't notice anything wrong straight away. The meal continued as normal and they talked about different things as well. When they finished the meal, they paid and proceeded to browse the shops. She got progressively worse and when Nick asked her what was wrong it was like she was having an anxiety attack. She wouldn't talk to Nick for the remainder of the date and they walked out of the mall back to the car.

&#x200B;

On the way back and in the car, Nick occasionally tried to start up a conversation but she felt silent. Nick was growing more flustered and had no idea what was going on. She began by questioning Nick and asking him questions about cheating. Nick answered and was thinking through the topic as well. It's safe to say Nick has never thought about some of the questions she asked him in a proper and serious manner. Especially considering how flustered Nick became, the environment where they had this talk wasn't calm in the least. Their discussion kept on going around in a circle and it felt like she wasn't listening to Nick at all and only feeding into her own fear. She kept on brushing off everything Nick said and wasn't taking it in at all.

She finally asked Nick ""Would you ever cheat on me?"" Part of Nick knew obviously to say ""No."" Even if Nick agreed or disagreed, Nick understands feelings are still important. The other half wanted to stay true to Nick and his way of thinking. Nick was thinking about what the lady said in the video and how things can just happen. Nick also didn't want to say a promise he couldn't keep. In the end Nick chose to say something along the lines of not answering with a firm no. Something like ""Nick cannot promise you that"". She got very sad and upset. That was the last time they ever talked in person. Nick sent a very long apology text later that night after thinking it through. Nick knew he had hurt her. However, Nick wanted to explain his side and how he couldn't betray himself and his way of thinking. Unfortunately she couldn't understand Nick's perspective.

The nature of Nick's work also means that Nick rarely gets to take any vacation time, and sometimes when Nick's girlfriend visits Nick has to work for some of the time she is there.

Normally, this is no issue; they found a way to make it work. This particular time, some cousins of Nick's with whom Nick has been close are visiting Nick's home country for the second time in their lives (10 years since the last time).

Main story:

This past weekend, Nick's girlfriend has been with them the whole time and coming out with them, so it was no issue. Now, weeks before they came, Nick planned to take Nick's cousins around Nick's country to visit other cities multiple hours away. Nick asked Nick's girlfriend to come along and be with them during these travels, but this morning Nick was asked by Nick's cousins not to bring Nick's girlfriend along because she ""changes the dynamic of the group."" Nick strongly disagrees with this and wants her with them, but it is Nick's cousins' vacation so Nick asked Nick's girlfriend if she would be ok with not coming. Obviously, she is devastated because they rarely get to see each other and she was really looking forward to the vacation, but now she has lost the opportunity to come with them. She booked time off work for this, though it can be easily reversed and most of the investment has been emotional.

Nick is torn because Nick wants to have her there and Nick rarely gets to see her as it is, but Nick feels like Nick owes it to Nick's cousins who are visiting to give them what they want. Nick also understands their point of view because when Nick visits them, they put their social life aside for Nick, though their relationships aren't long distance like Nick's. They hold no ill will to Nick's girlfriend, but want them to be alone. Before they told Nick they want to spend time alone, Nick promised Nick's girlfriend that everyone would get along, that they would all have a good time together and actively encouraged her to come.

Nick's girlfriend is hurt and upset at them, and is asking for Nick to somehow make up for the time lost between them before the end of summer by going on a separate other mini-vacation later on. This is really demanding for Nick as Nick's girlfriend and Nick went on a 2 week vacation together earlier this summer and now with Nick's cousins Nick is taking even more time off. A second vacation is going to be costly both financially and to Nick's work. Nick is asking her to ""let it go"" this time, and to see the other perspective even if it is unfair to her, but she is incredibly upset about the time lost together because she was looking forward to coming and because now she won't get to see Nick for another few weeks.

1,"AITA for not wanting to go to Judy son's wedding? | Throwaway.

Judy son has been dating 'Vanessa' for nearly 3 years now, last weekend they annouced they were enagaged. Judy has never been fond of Vanessa, mainly because Vanessa has never gelled with the family due to her general aloof attitude and lack of effort to engage socially. Vanessa will often refuse to join in conversations or activities. Judy son insists it's because Vanessa is shy but Judy thinks its very clear that Vanessa believes herself 'above us'.

Judy also strongly susspects Vanessa is using Judy son for his money, Vanessa has almost no income, Vanessa works as a nanny 2 days a week and spends the rest of the time selling hand made crafts on etsy or at markets. Judy son is in a well paid tech job and Judy thinks Vanessa is taking adavantage of the fact he's well off. Vanessa jumped at the opportunity to move into his nice aparetment very early in their relationship because Vanessa had been living in a unplesant house share. There have been other similar instances.

Judy son was at Judy house a few days after the annoucment and the conversation turned to the wedding. They were discussing venues and Judy mentioned their local church, he told Judy that Vanessa didn't like the idea of having it at church as Vanessa wasn't religious, Vanessa wanted an outside wedding. Judy told him that was just impractical, he has several older family members who would not only find the idea of a non religous, outdoor wedding distasteful but would struggle with the limitations that come with it, poor seating, lack of proper toilet facilities, bad weather etc. He said they would figure it out and it was their wedding so it shouldn't matter what the rest of the family thought. This is very unlike Judy son as Judy has always taught him to be considerate of others opinions and the value of family.

At this point Judy was upset and hurt and told him that Judy didn't agree with the ideas they had come up with and Judy didn't want to put any money towards the wedding like this. Judy son got angry and told Judy that they didn't need any financial help, they had savings and Vanessa was planning to cut costs by making decorations. Judy said he was going to end up blowing all his savings and there was no way Vanessa would be able to make all the decorsations with all the other things Vanessa would be focusing on during planning so he would end up paying for those too and they would start married life with a huge dent in his savings which is just a terrible idea.

He then accused Judy of never supporting his relationship and told Judy if Judy wouldn't support his wedding then Judy might as well not come. Judy told him Judy might take him up on that as Judy doesn't support his attitude and maybe his own mother not wanting to come to his wedding will help him realise how ridiclous he's being about it.

1,"AITA for planning a two week long trip out of state to visit family without discussing it with his wife? | Hey guys, so Nick is going to give both sides because they both usually use this and want to get the full story told so they know who is really in the wrong here.  

Nick just recently found out his grandpa is dying. He hasn't seen him in 17 years. He has always wanted to visit, but never could, and now that he's dying he wants to see him one last time. When he heard the news, he didn't even think about it, he just bought the plane ticket. He's in Maine, they're in Texas. Nick is going for two weeks.  

When Nick told his wife, she was pissed. She said she couldn't believe he didn't at least discuss it with her first, rather than just telling her he is leaving. But that was because it was a split second decision, plus they have a 5 month old that they can't exactly bring with them and she just started a new job, so she can't really just leave for two weeks.  

She suggested they wait and go together later on, and just go for a couple days, but they still would have to find something to do with the baby, and she'd have to find time off work, and they'd have to afford a 2nd plane ticket, and he really wanted to stay at least 2 weeks to spend time with family and have time to himself to recover from the plane trip before he meets up with them. She's now demanding he cancel it until it's discussed further, he thinks that's totally unreasonable considering he already bought it and he doesn't exactly know how long he's going to live. It might be too late if they wait. AITA?  

Wife's side  

So, Judy's husband has been talking about visiting his family for the past 6 years. Judy has always encouraged him to, way before the baby. He always used the fact that he hates planes as an excuse, as well as not being sure how to face his family after going so long without seeing them. He does however facetime them fairly often and seems to do fine with that. His parents also offered to let them ride with them when they visit, which he also turned down.  

Now, years later, when they have a baby and Judy just started working again after a complicated pregnancy and even more complicated emergency c section recovery, he drops on Judy, hey, he is leaving the 25th to go see his family for 2 weeks in Maine. Judy is sorry but WTF?? Where was the discussion for this huge decision? Judy has to find last minute childcare (her only close relatives are her elderly grandparents so they can't help), rides to work (legally blind, can't drive even with glasses), and balance work and baby with no support for two weeks. Judy did freak out when he told her, and told him he needs to cancel the trip right away until they properly discuss it and figure something out, but that something will most definitely not include leaving for two damn weeks, but rather maybe 3 days with them BOTH.

1,"AITA for Nick choosing to go with his girlfriend of one month as her plus one to a wedding over attending his best friend of 10 years’ birthday dinner? | TLDR: Nick’s girlfriend’s friend is getting married next weekend and Nick agreed to go with her as her plus one. Nick has to skip his best friend’s 30th birthday dinner for that so now she’s angry at Nick.

A few months back Nick’s best friend asked over group chat if Nick and their other friends had anything scheduled on the weekend of her birthday because she wanted to have a dinner party. Everyone said they were free so far, but other details were never finalized and she never said anything else about it after that so Nick didn’t think much of it.

Nick’s girlfriend asked Nick last week if Nick wanted to go as her plus one to her friend’s wedding and Nick said yes. The next day Nick’s best friend messaged Nick reminding Nick of her birthday dinner this weekend. Nick said he didn’t know she was going through with the dinner and Nick already said yes to going with his girlfriend to her friend’s wedding, so Nick couldn’t go to his best friend’s dinner.

Nick’s best friend said she never said it was postponed so why did Nick assume that she wasn’t going through with it. She said it’s hard to coordinate everyone’s schedule and everyone else was free this weekend so she hoped Nick would go. Nick said he was sorry Nick assumed wrong but again Nick already said yes to his girlfriend.

Nick’s best friend said she gets it and to have fun at the wedding. Nick said thanks and promised to make it up to her and their other friends. But later that night she messaged Nick and said she’s been thinking about it the whole night and she tried to understand but she can’t get over the fact that Nick chose a girl Nick had been dating for a month over people Nick had been friends with for years.

Nick told her Nick wasn’t choosing his girlfriend over them, it was just that his girlfriend invited Nick to a finalized event first. Nick’s best friend said the wedding is full of people who don’t know Nick and won’t care if Nick is there or not, while it is her birthday and the dinner is with people who’ve been friends with Nick for 10 years and will miss something if Nick isn’t there. She said she’s always been there for Nick and the one time she asks Nick to be there for her Nick puts a person Nick barely knew first and she doesn’t know if she can get past that.

Nick tried calling and messaging her but she blocked Nick. They used to talk every day but she hasn’t said a word to Nick in three days. Their other friends don’t seem to know what’s going on and will go to her dinner as far as Nick can tell from their group chat.

She’s Nick’s best friend and Nick doesn’t want her to be hurt but on the other hand Nick feels like she's overreacting. She knows Nick’s girlfriend is very important to Nick too, and even though they’ve known each other for just two months, Nick has very strong feelings for her and can see a future with her.

1,"AITA for refusing to go to his sister's wedding? | Is Nick (28M) the asshole for not wanting to go to his sister's (24F) wedding and ending a friendship with his best friend (29M)? 

So here's some backstory: Nick and his best friend had been friends since middle school. They were like brothers and they used to hang out every day. His best friend is a good guy but Nick recently found out his best friend had been dating Nick's younger sister behind Nick's back. Nick hadn't known until then. It was only when Nick's sister announced they were going to get married Nick knew what was going on. Apparently, they had been dating for many years and engaged for 14 months without telling anyone.

Fast forward to today, and Nick's sister announces she's going to get married and the wedding is next week. She invited her whole family to the wedding. Nick thought maybe she had been secretly dating someone maybe that's why she suddenly is going to get married. And maybe she hid it from Nick as she knew Nick would disapprove as Nick is overprotective? Nick's sister is the type of girl every guy wants (blonde hair, blue eyes and she's very pretty and has big boobs). A lot of guys hit on her and Nick is afraid someone will use her or hurt her so that's why Nick is overprotective. But Nick guessed she's going to get married anyway so there's nothing he could do other than to congratulate her. However, the next thing she said shocked Nick: Her fiance is Nick's best friend. Apparently, they started dating in 2014 and got engaged around Christmas 2018. After hearing this, Nick felt betrayed and angry. Nick is disappointed in both his sister and his best friend, especially his best friend. No one fucks their best friend's little sister. Nobody does shit like that. To make matters even worse, they hid their relationship from Nick and Nick's family for 6 years. Nick is going to end the friendship with his best friend (a.k.a. future brother-in-law) for being a backstabbing piece of shit. Nick is done with him.  

Anyway, Nick told his sister that Nick won't go to her wedding or want to have anything to do with her soon-to-be husband and she freaked out. She wants Nick to walk her down the aisle and give her away (their father died three years ago and Nick is her only sibling). But there is no way Nick will go to her wedding. Nick means his best friend is going to be his brother-in-law? It just feels too weird. So Nick told her to either walk down the aisle alone or find someone else to do the honor. Well, Nick's sister started crying and begging Nick to come to her wedding. She says she wants Nick's blessing. But she will never get it because Nick will never approve of her marriage.

Then Nick and his sister talked with their mother and she said Nick is being selfish. She also said that Nick should go to his sister's wedding. But Nick said it's Nick's choice whether he is going or not and no one can force him. However, Nick's sister says Nick is a horrible brother and that Nick hurt her feelings. Nick knows it's her special day but Nick really doesn't want to see her fiance again.

1,"Judy asked if she was the asshole for telling her sister she couldn't date Judy's ex-husband. Judy and her twin sister (both 24F) had been friends with one of their neighbors (23M) since birth. Growing up, they did everything together. He and Judy's sister had feelings for each other throughout their teenage years, and dated for almost a year when they were 16. After they broke up, they all kept on being best friends. They never had hard feelings about their break-up. However, Judy's sister did admit to Judy about two years later that she was still in love with him.

For his 21st birthday, the three of them went out to celebrate. About half-way through the night, Judy's sister decided to go home with this random guy, leaving Judy and him alone. They danced and drank and hung out for a few more hours, and all night there was this weird tension in the air. They ended up spending the night together. It was totally unexpected but amazing. Like, suddenly Judy saw her friend in a totally new light.

They felt kinda bad about it since he and Judy's sister used to date, but they figured it had been a while since their break-up so it shouldn't matter. That said, they decided to put off telling her about their new relationship until there was something to tell. They had a lust-crazed, wild month together before deciding they were totally in love. Then, he asked Judy to marry him. It was impromptu but also felt really right in the moment. They got married three days later, without telling anyone, including Judy's sister.

They revealed that they'd gotten married a week later, which came as a shock to most people who knew them, since they didn't know they were together. Judy talked to her sister about it, and her sister said congrats, though honestly she didn't seem that happy.

Unfortunately, the marriage didn't last long. The ""crazy in love"" feeling faded quickly, and they were separated within two months. They both realized that they'd made a mistake, and that they weren't right for each other. Ultimately, Judy considers their brief relationship a funny blip in the story of Judy's life, a moment of ""what was Judy thinking?"" However, the three of them have all maintained their friendship since then, with their short marriage something of a joke between them.

Last week, however, Judy's sister called Judy. She said that she and he had been flirting for a few months now, and that they'd like to give a real relationship another shot. She said that she'd really always been at least a little in love with him, and that she hoped Judy would give her Judy's blessing to pursue this.

Judy said no. Judy thinks it's entirely inappropriate for her sister to even ask, honestly. That's Judy's ex-husband! What kind of sister wants to date her sister's ex-husband?

Judy's sister said that Judy was being cruel, and prioritizing a three-month relationship over her sister's feelings (feelings which her sister claims she's held her whole life, though Judy thinks that's BS, or she would have said something when they got married). Judy's sister says she'd have liked Judy's blessing, but is going to date him with or without Judy's support.

1,"AITA for holding a grudge over Nick being passed over for the bridal party of a longtime friend? | Throwaway account just in case, though god only knows if this situation is common enough for that to matter or not. Buckle up, this is gonna get long.

So, Nick's best friend. Let’s call her Mary. Nick and Mary had been friends for over a decade and they got along great. Like any friends, they had disagreements but they could tell each other anything. They’d always been there for each other through painful breakups, bad grades on tests, big accomplishments, everything.

Mary recently got married and obviously Nick was thrilled for her. Now since high school at least, they’d always talk about getting married, being in each other’s bridal parties, etc. Obviously this is not a legally binding contract but things like that mean a lot to people, at least they did to Nick.

So several months before the wedding they were hanging out and she broke the news to Nick that they’d decided to keep the bridal party family-only. Was Nick upset? Yeah, obviously, but hey, Nick could understand keeping things small. Then Nick found out that this family-only party included her fiancé’s brother’s girlfriend. Yeah, girlfriend. Not wife or even fiancée, girlfriend. Nick was blindsided and hurt, because to Nick, that’s NOT family. Nick and Mary might not share blood but in every other way they are sisters. Nick couldn’t believe she would do this to him. Nick knows that being a bridesmaid might not be a big deal to everyone, but to Nick this felt like a complete betrayal of their friendship.

Nick told Mary he needed space and she said she understood. They didn’t talk for a few months, the longest ever, but eventually Nick decided he didn’t want to lose their friendship over this. She knows more about Nick than probably anyone else in the world and he loves her. So they made up and Nick went to the wedding. Honestly it was pretty painful for Nick to be there because he felt like an outsider rather than a best friend. But Nick made it through the night without bashing her husband’s brother’s girlfriend’s head in so hey, he’d call that a win.

All was well, or not. Nick had noticed lately he’d been rather petty in his stupid revenge. He would cancel plans last minute for no real reason, let the phone ring through to voicemail, leave texts on read, etc. They live quite far apart (as in several hours) so this could be a pretty big inconvenience as it’s no day trip. And yeah, like Nick said, he knows this is all totally stupid, totally juvenile revenge. But it turns out Nick was still hurt and angry and he didn’t know what else to do. He tried talking to her about this before but he’d always known she was someone who had “brothers before sisters” priorities. Nick suspects it was his choice to do this for the bridal party for reasons Nick won’t get into, which is why Nick knows if he talks to her about it she’ll just get defensive.

Nick is an 18 year old guy and he has a twin sister. Nick has been best friends with his best friend (we'll call him G) since kindergarten, so G and his sister have always been pretty close too. They've kind of had a ""thing"" going on their whole lives. For the longest time, they never officially dated for a bunch of different reasons Nick won't get into, but they were always really close and really into each other.

A little over a year ago, when they were all 17, they finally started dating. Everything went really well for like 13 months, but then long story short, G cheated on Nick's sister and Nick was the one who figured it out. He swore it wouldn't happen again and begged Nick not to tell his sister but Nick told her anyway. Nick was mad at him and he was mad at Nick so they didn't talk for a month and a half, which was honestly the weirdest month and a half of Nick's whole life. G's practically like Nick's brother, they've been inseparable since kindergarten, so not having him around was kinda....unbearable honestly lol

After their streak of not talking to each other, G invited Nick on his family ski trip as a way to make amends (Nick has been on lots of his family's ski trips through the years). Nick accepted and ended up forgiving him and letting him back into his life because it was way too weird without him in it. Nick can tell he's genuinely sorry about what happened. He literally cried cause he felt so bad and Nick has only seen him cry like once before in his whole life

Anyway, G and Nick's sister broke up as soon as she found out he cheated and they're still not on speaking terms, so Nick's sister obviously isn't happy about the whole situation. She's making Nick feel like shit for still being friends with G, and she doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it would be for them to lose their 13 year friendship over her. Nick knows G made a huge mistake, he hates him for it and he'll never 100% get over it, but he's not gonna let it ruin his best and longest friendship. Nick thinks about it like this: if your best friend cheated on their SO and then felt like shit, would you end your friendship with them? No. So why is this any different just because his SO happened to be Nick's sister? G and Nick are going to the same college in the fall (a different college in a different state than the one his sister's going to), so none of this is gonna be something that they even think about when they're living in different places

On a previous visit when the three of them were going to eat at the cafeteria throwawaygrandson had asked Grammie and Nick if they were inviting his Mom to eat with them. Your Mom said they would not and said something neutral that didn’t bash his Mom.

Nick feels the same with throwaways-other-ex-daughter even though what she did to throwaways-other-son and their family disgusts Nick as much as what throwaways-ex-daughter did to you and her family. Nick did not wish her Merry any holiday nor happy birthday nor do they share any chit chat communications. While you and Nick cannot see this from each other’s perspective they can agree to disagree without exposing throwawaysgrandson to the depth of the issues between his parents. Regardless of how badly you decide to punish Nick please do not put any of this on throwawaysgrandson. Today was just a normal fun day with Grandpa that happened to include his Mom.

Problem is, he is scheduled for one of his business trips and he is due to go to the other side of the country. He has tried everything in his power - he has literally done everything you could think of other than quitting. He has sat down with his people manager over this, they spent many many hours figuring out logistics and potential replacements, only to get overruled by those above him and his boss. He has filed complaints. He has rocked the boat as much as he can but he can't get out of this. And he is not quitting for a variety of reasons, but chief amongst them is:  

1) This is the best and highest-paying job he has ever had and he does not want to give it up.  

2) They only just escaped a tough financial situation and while they do have around 4 months of savings built up, he really does not want to risk it.

C knows that Nick likes M and Nick is just waiting for the right time to ask her out again.

Nick asked M out before but she turned Nick down. Nick was overweight and had confidence issues then, and that led to Nick getting angry at her. Nick and M didn’t talk for a time. Nick missed their friendship and regretted reacting the way Nick did. C helped Nick by becoming the bridge between Nick and M. M and Nick eventually started talking again.

Since then Nick has gone to the gym, lost weight and gained confidence. Nick also got closer to M. Nick and M talk almost every day about almost everything. She gets Nick special gifts on Nick's birthdays and always encourages Nick to continue being healthier (Nick still has a bit to lose to get to Nick's target weight). Nick wanted to ask her out again, but Nick was waiting for the right time. Nick just needed a sign to assure Nick that she’s ready to be more than friends.

Since last year Nick has noticed that she and C have been talking a lot. They have inside jokes in Nick's group chat with Nick's other friends, tell each other things that they don’t tell the rest of Nick and Nick's friends, they don’t cancel lunch or dinner plans if Nick and Nick's other friends can’t make it, they just go by themselves. Nick figured their newfound closeness is because they bonded over a new game that they both play. M and Nick still talked every day, and C and Nick still talked and C never said anything whenever Nick mentioned wanting to ask M out again.

So Nick was shocked and felt very betrayed when C suddenly asked if he could date M. Turns out the week before, they met up for midnight fast food and when C drove her home they looked at each other and ended up kissing. M told C that they shouldn’t have done that but she wasn’t angry; she just said they're friends, it’s fine, let’s not talk about it again. C has been thinking of her ever since and he thinks he has feelings for her and wants to tell her. Nick told C that C is a backstabber and that from now on Nick and C are no longer friends.

Nick told Nick's friend R what happened and asked how best to let the rest of Nick's friends know. R consoled Nick but said it was not right to get angry at C because M is not an object that Nick can ‘reserve’. But that’s not the point. C knew how Nick felt about M and C still did what C did, behind Nick's back. C broke Nick's trust.

With the money from Judy's job, Judy gave him $30K a few years later that he could use as the down payment for his own commercial truck.

Other than that, they'd kept their finances separate and paid for things 50/50.

Like an absolute freaking idiot and terrible person, Judy had an affair with a supervisor. It's one of Judy's biggest regrets. Judy is not gonna blame it on anything, it was Judy's fault and it breaks Judy's heart to know Judy broke such a good man. Robert was devastated when he found out and to this day, it's been two years since their divorce, he's still a different person than he was before.

Judy has stayed close with his parents and siblings because they have known each other for 15+ years and have always gotten along. Robert is still friendly with Judy's brother and parents as well but they don't talk to each other.

Robert's brother, Chris, and Judy have always been really friendly. He lived outside of their hometown for the past few years but moved back recently and has always been great to Judy. Judy thinks because he didn't live here when the divorce went down, he doesn't hold it against Judy at all. He's told Judy that he somewhat understands where Judy was coming from because Robert can be emotionally distant but overall he's been honest to say that Judy shouldn't have done what Judy did. Judy agrees with him.

Chris & Judy have a lot in common and have been hanging out a lot recently. He said to Judy point blank: ""listen, my family will be mad if you and I get involved but I'm willing to take the heat if you're willing to take this thing serious"" and Judy honestly is. He's a really great guy, but the problem is Judy doesn't want to hurt Robert anymore than Judy has. He's dating again and seems happier, but Judy is still not sure. Would Judy be the asshole if Judy dated Chris? He and Robert aren't that close btw due to age & personality difference.",False,False,4,3,5,2,2,3,Loyalty,488
1,"AITA for asking the husband's sister to consider being a surrogate for them? | The husband and Judy had been trying for pregnancy for years, and to cut a long story short it seemed as though it would never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but the couple had gradually gotten there. Their entire family was aware of the journey the couple had been on and how much it meant to them. With that in mind, the husband and Judy came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.

Sarah was in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this the couple thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on their behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. The husband was extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, the couple did not feel it was out of order to ask that sort of question.

They invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out their request. They told her they had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus they had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. They told her why it was important to them and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.

Sarah exploded at them. She said they were both out of their minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that they had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right then she was refusing to take calls from them and even went as far as to ask the husband's parents to tell them both not to contact her until she decided to initiate it herself. The husband's parents were sympathetic to them but said that they should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. Judy's parents thought she was behaving awfully. Most of Judy's friends were on Judy's side but a few had said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knew how much Sarah hated kids.

It was really weighing on Judy's mind and Judy honestly never expected that kind of outcome. She literally blocked them on every platform she could. Were they really the ones behaving like an asshole?",False,False,3,4,5,1,2,3,Loyalty,452
1,"Is Nick the Asshole for getting angry at his friend who needs a ""break"" from the friendship? | Nick (28M) has an old friend (29F) whose friendship has become relatively low maintenance over the years, where at times months pass without them seeing each other. They still have infrequent communications by text/phone call, and whenever they do meet, it’s as though no time has passed – they catch each other up on life, commiserate about shitty things going on, and reminisce about old times (a healthy, functioning adult friendship, in Nick's opinion). 

The past 12 months at work had been intense, Nick was travelling interstate for weeks and months at a time and was hardly ever in his home city. Nick saw his friend twice during that period (once for her birthday where Nick dropped in for dinner and had to leave early to attend another event, and again for Nick's birthday where they had a one-on-one catch up). Nick is now back in his home city, and life has returned to its normal pace.

About a month ago (June) Nick realised his friend hadn’t responded to his calls and text messages for about two months (April/May). Nick put it down to life being busy, but just to be sure Nick sent a text message and left a voice message along the lines of: “Not sure if you’re getting Nick's calls/texts, but Nick hasn’t heard from you in a while. Nick doesn’t want to seem neurotic, but are we cool?”. 

Nick expected a tongue in check response, but Nick was served a proper essay about being an absent friend, being generally selfish, and not making the time, and, because of that, she “needed a break” from him. She cited Nick's leaving early from her last birthday as a major issue. It took the wind out of Nick's sails. This was one of Nick's oldest friends. Nick tried to call back as soon as Nick read the message, but the phone rang out. 

Nick sent back a pretty defensive text message asking her why she left it so long without saying anything, and apologising. It was angry in tone, Nick guessed. Nick got nothing back. Today, Nick sent another text message, but this was a lot angrier in tone. Nick feels like Nick is being cut out, and Nick can’t see how Nick is in the wrong. Is Nick missing something? 

Nick reached out to a mutual friend for an objective opinion, and he said Nick is the asshole for not respecting that she “needs space”. Nick thinks this is a cop-out. They hardly see each other as it is, yet she needs more space. Is Nick being unreasonable?

She's trying to blackmail Nick, tithe to her mega church or pay nieces ER bill! | Since pretty much everyone thought Nick was the asshole there (Nick accepted his judgement but didn't agree) Nick thought Nick would update with the latest shots fired in this war. It started when Nick and his sister were kids but became nuclear when Nick tried to wear a thong bathing suit on the beach.

This is the original from Saturday: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7blaf/aita_for_hosting_a_family_dinner_but_making_a/

So late last night Nick's sister called. Nick honestly didn't want to answer but Nick took what people said to Nick to heart and figured at some point Nick and his sister needed to bury the hatchet and at least Nick's sister was reaching out. So Nick answered and Nick ALMOST fell for it. Nick's sister started in by saying Nick and his sister were sisters and Nick's sister would always love Nick and Nick and his sister were the two oldest and Nick and his sister needed to set an example for all of Nick's mother and daddy's grandkids. Nick told his sister Nick agreed. Nick's sister said she would try harder to. Nick said Nick was sorry for not understanding the dangers of the peanut allergy.

Then since Nick's sister is literally the most evil person on the planet, she took Nick's apology and said ""about that, we aren't sure insurance is going to cover the ER visit and Nick and David do think Nick should be responsible."" Nick told his sister that she knew what Nick was making a week in advance. Nick's sister ignored Nick and told Nick ""David and Nick know Nick has strayed from the church in recent years which is why Nick and David think Nick and his sister have so many problems. Nick and David would gladly accept Nick giving an equal amount to Nick and David's church and Nick and David will call it even. Nick and David want Nick back with Jesus.""

So Nick's sister belongs to a Joel Osteen Mega church rip off (if anyone lives anywhere near NW Florida they know exactly who Nick is talking about). There is no way in hell Nick is going to be out of work and pay his sister's BS church a cent. Nick told his sister Nick wasn't going to be shaken down like that. Nick's sister said it was for the good of the family. Nick told his sister she was the one at fault for all of that by treating Nick like shit for Nick's entire life and Nick hung up on his sister.

1,"AITA for Judy wanting to let Judy's family know Judy's daughter is getting married and post one or two pictures of the cake Judy's baking on social media? | Judy's daughter is getting married to her boyfriend of 2 years at the courthouse next week, while he's on leave from the army. This is not a shotgun wedding. They do not plan to have kids for the foreseeable future (if ever.)  

They intend to have a proper wedding in the future, when finances allow. However, in the meantime, she's forbidden Judy from mentioning it to anyone in Judy's family or even friends of Judy's who know her, but do not know the family.  

These are kids who never had an apartment and want Judy and her husband (the parents) to give them what they need to get started. It's a financial imposition to ask Judy and her husband to furnish their house, and Judy knows that both Judy's family and the groom's family would be delighted to help if they could.  

In addition, the groom's family all knows this is going to happen and Judy feels Judy's family will be terribly hurt if they are shut out completely. Judy and her husband are not inviting people to the courthouse, obviously, but they can call and offer their Congratulations anyway. Judy's worried that, when they finally do have their wedding, nobody will want to come because they weren't even given the dignity of a notice.  

Further, Judy makes lots of crafts and baked goods. Judy likes to post the projects on social media for critiques and she's forbidden Judy from posting the wedding cake picture. Her real wedding will have a professional cake, but Judy wanted the practice, and only a few people will be there. Frankly, Judy's enthusiasm for helping her is dwindling and Judy is contemplating *not* baking the cake, as literally this exposure was all Judy wanted.  

Judy's also thinking of offering her less for setting up house. Judy's original thinking was, they could save up faster if they don't have to buy furniture and dishes. But she won't let Judy and her husband enlist the help of others. Judy and her husband have to replace what they give her and do without in the meantime, because they don't have money to buy these things right now. They're willing to do this for their comfort. It sure would be nice to see if anyone else is planning on getting rid of some old furniture or dishes so they can get started.

Throughout that entire time, she has never been comfortable with his relationship with his female best friend who Nick has known since high school.

His friend is someone very special, and very close to him. She is smart, caring, beautiful, and an extremely loving and funny person. She honestly does mean the world to him and since freshman year in highschool she has been the one who has been with him through so many events in his life, including his moms passing.

His fiancé has been in his life for eight months, and can't understand the bond that Nick has with his best friend. She has openly told him that it makes her uncomfortable how Nick spends time with her. Nick usually tries to change the subject but now that they're engaged shes become a lot more hostile to both him and his best friend.

What really pissed him off is that she almost drove his best friend to tears recently over dinner, basically indirectly criticizing her for always hanging around someone elses man instead of finding her own.

Nick confronted his fiancé in private and she just asked him to not invite her to the wedding. Nick put his foot down and said that he loves her, and that the type of relationship he has with her comes once in a lifetime. Nick may have also crossed the line in the heat of the moment by calling his best friend his soul mate, as he was just trying to articulate how much he loves her as it does goes beyond just being a best friend.

His fiancé basically breaks down crying, (she does this a lot to get her way) and says that Nick must hate her. Nick says Nick hates the way she's acting. She then asks what his friend has that she doesn't, and Nick decides not to engage any further.

Later Nick tells her the truth of the matter is that he loves them both, and he just wants everyone to get a long. She says im being emotionally abusive for telling her that he loves another woman.

Given that she's meeting clients all the time she needs to dress to impress. She's heavily into fashion and likes the best stuff. She earns a high salary and chooses to get tailored suits crafted from scratch. They're truly beautiful pieces which give her a very professional and serious look.

Nick's brother, his brother's wife and their 18 year old daughter Chloe popped in today for lunch. She has a job interview tomorrow for an IT apprenticeship. Apparently she was one of very few who made it to the interview stage, and the company's interviews are notoriously harsh. Unfortunately she doesn't think she has anything she could wear to the interview. She does have some ''formal'' clothing but according to her its more the stuff you wear at a wedding rather than something professional for a job interview.

In spite of the age difference Rachel and Chloe are quite close in both height and build. Although Rachel's suits are tailored to her, Nick thought they would still look nice on Chloe.

Nick took some stuff out of Rachel's room and suggested Chloe try them on. She ended up really liking one of Rachel's dark suits. She looked amazing in it and Nick imagines she'll look very professional in the interview room. Nick let her take the suit and give it back after her interview.

Rachel was out with her friends today, and when she got home Nick told her about the day. When Nick told her Chloe took one of her suits she went mad, saying how dare Nick touch her things, calling him a ''fucking idiot'' and storming off and slamming the door like a teenager.

Nick had a chat with his husband, and with some thought Nick agrees that Nick should have asked Rachel before he gave Chloe her stuff, but even so Nick did it to help out a family member which is hardly a bad thing. Rachel's reaction was also extremely over the top. She had a tantrum like a teenager and sulked in her room all day. She's acting like a spoiled brat.

Nick is very close to his 3 brothers and 2 sisters as well as his mother. Judy said that her family wants to see her and him together for New Year's Eve but Nick would prefer to spend it with his own family instead because that's where Nick feels more comfortable and that's where Nick can be himself but when Nick is around her family, Nick is basically on his best behaviour. That's why Nick rarely visits them or even talks to them on the phone. Whenever one of Judy's family calls her on her FaceTime, Nick quickly removes himself and goes to another room. Usually Nick's basement/gaming room and Judy always calls Nick out saying it's rude to walk out of the room when her family calls her despite that Nick keeps telling Judy that Nick is trying to give her the space she needs just in case Judy is talking about personal stuff that Nick doesn't need to hear but Judy calls bullshit at that because Judy says that when Nick talks to his family on the phone, Judy always makes the effort to talk to them but Nick never asks Judy to do that and his family doesn't care that much about Judy.

Nick has been hanging out with this group of friends for about 11 years. Some Nick met during college and others got into it as the years went by. Last year the group lost one of their friends, Michael, because of a cardiac arrest. Michael was married, had been for 4 years and knew his wife for even longer than that. In the same group there is Adam, who was friends with Michael since high school and got into the group at the same time Michael did.

Now the issue that is the reason behind this post is that Adam has told the group a couple days ago that he's dating Michael's widow. They were all surprised by this because they never saw it coming. After Michael died they all did their best to provide comfort and support for her, Adam included, but as far as they knew and as far as Adam told them at the time they were just hanging out/having talks when she needed. Now they get to find out Adam and the widow have been getting to know each other better for at least 6 months. When Michael has been dead for 1 year and 4 months.

This has split the group in three. The ones that believe that Adam and the widow should be allowed to do whatever they want and don't see a problem with it. Then the ones that believe Adam is taking advantage of Michael's widow. And the ones that think they're both wrong and also don't want to be around Adam and her anymore.

Nick is with the last group. Yes, everyone deals with grief in different ways but this doesn't sit right with Nick and Nick also thinks it's just a tasteless thing to do.

1,"AITA for hosting a family dinner but making a Thai peanut dish specifically so Judy's sister and her kids couldn't attend (too spicy and allergic to peanuts)? | Hello again AITA, you guys have previously weighed in on the long running battle between Judy and her sister so Judy figured she'd turn to you again to see if she really messed up. Judy is always on her family's bad side so Judy appreciated the neutral input last time.

Somehow it's become a tradition in Judy's family that one family member host a Friday night dinner once a month. Last night was Judy's night. Judy's oldest sister and Judy have not been speaking since their vacation (click on user name to see why if you're curious) and Judy was able to avoid her at the January and February dinner at other's houses. Judy really, really didn't want her in her apartment. So Judy decided since she hates spicy food and her kids are allegedly allergic to peanuts, Judy could side step the  issue and make this Thai peanut noodle dish that Judy loves. Judy announced it well in advance in the group email what Judy was planning. 

Well since Judy's sister is much more diabolical than Judy gives her credit for, she had her husband drive the 2 hours to Judy's place, feign that she didn't know Judy was making something that allowed her to say ""you know my family can't eat! Isn't the point of a family dinner so all the family can enjoy!"" While clutching her pearls (literally). Then Judy's niece claimed she could feel the ""peanut residue in the air"" and it was affecting her ability to breathe. So Judy's sister dramatically took her to the emergency room where all turned out to be fine.

But again, Judy lost. Judy's sister played her like a fiddle and the entire family took her side. Dinner was ruined and Judy is the bad guy. Again.

They met through a student organization they were all involved with their freshman year of college and had been very close ever since. Let's call the other girls Ariel, Brianna, Carmen and Dana.

Judy was the first to get married five years ago and she made all four of the girls her bridesmaids. Ariel, Brianna and Carmen all got married within the past two years and Judy was a bridesmaid in all three of their weddings. Judy was also a bridesmaid for her sister and two cousins around this time period, and between all of the dresses, hotel costs, flights, bachelorette parties, bridal showers and gifts, it ended up becoming a massive financial strain that ultimately cost Judy thousands and thousands of dollars, not to mention tons of vacation days. After Carmen's wedding, Judy decided she was done being a bridesmaid, it was just too much.

Dana didn't have a lot of luck with relationships and was single for pretty much the entire time they were friends, but she finally announced she and her boyfriend are engaged. They were all thrilled for her, of course, and she asked all of them to be her bridesmaids. Judy gently told Dana that her days of being in a wedding party were over, but she would be happy to support Dana in other ways, such as helping with centerpieces and general wedding planning, and Judy would be there for sure on the big day.

Dana blew up at Judy and said it wasn't fair that Judy had been a bridesmaid for the other three girls but wouldn't do it for her. Dana said it had been really hard for her to always be the single friend at all of their weddings and now that it was finally her time to get married Judy owed it to her to be a bridesmaid.

So around 5 years ago in Nick's class there was a girl in Nick's class that would go to meetings of some terrorist groups because she supported their cause.
Well Nick would get mad at this but since this did not affect Nick that much Nick never cared too much to say anything about it since she never confronted Nick about Nick's ideals.

Her last words Nick heard was that she was going to a meeting with her family to support their cause.
Well the next days on the news Nick saw that there was an attack on the meeting site and that some people had died. Well those days that kind of stuff would happen very often in turkey so it was not surprising that it would have happened in a meeting.
After the weekend the whole class was aware of that she died and stood silent in a means to grief for her.
Well Nick wasn't having none of that and spoke out during the lunch break that she was supporting an illegal party that would use every means possible to get what they want. So Nick told that she knew what was coming her way and that she deserved it since she supported them.

Nick really saw her as his rock.

A few days ago, Nick sent Mary a document with the whole book. It’s about 250 pages, not particularly long. A week later, Nick messaged her to ask how she was liking it. She said she finished and loved it. As Nick was talking to her about it he realized it sounded like she didn’t read anything more than the first 25-50 pages or so. Nick asked her some questions; her knowledge was incomplete and some things she just got plain wrong. When Nick asked her if she had even read it, she said no. Nick asked why she lied, and she said, “It’s not really my thing. I didn’t know how to tell you.” She apologized and said she’d read it. Nick said, “no need, Nick knows where they stand now” and he blocked her.

The book feels almost ruined for Nick now. Every time he looks at it, Nick thinks about how Mary lied to him about enjoying it. Everything nice she said is cruel in retrospect. One thing Nick can’t fathom is that she couldn’t even slog her way through the whole thing. She just read a few pages and called it quits. Nick doesn’t see that as being a friend. He knows it takes time to read a book, but he’s not asking her to read Moby Dick or anything. Friends do that for friends.

Nick's mutual friends are telling him that he’s being unreasonable. They say that Mary feels really awful and has read Nick's book and wants to talk to him about it. Nick doesn’t want to hear more lies and he thinks that her actions and lies totally speak for themselves in this case.

Nick's father had health problems for the last few years and he recently succumbed to them.. During this time Nick's brother had gotten married and was on his honeymoon.

Nick made the choice to be the one to inform his brother of the news. Their mother died years ago, so Nick is the only one left in their family that's closest to his brother. Nick told any other distant family members to refrain from letting his brother know until Nick said it was okay.

Nick decided in all fairness, that his brother should get to enjoy his honeymoon with his new wife, and Nick decided not to tell him until he got back.

Nick expected he would be surprised, but he sounded flabbergasted as if their father had no health problems prior to his death. Nick told him that this was going to happen eventually.

She has taken snapchat videos of him sitting in his crate growling at her, and has taken multiple pictures of the bite marks he has left on her.

Nick and Judy tried many behavioral changes, and some days were better than others. Two weeks ago after an incident they decided to take Max to the vet where he was checked out, given blood work, and ultimately put on a low dosage of Prozac. Things were going very well. For example Thursday Judy stayed home while Nick was at work and gave Max a bath and they had a great time cuddling and watching Netflix.

His jokes can be a bit off colour though and sometimes border on insensitive. But he means well, and usually just gets excused because he’s old.

Nick’s sister in law is 30, and she married Nick’s older brother last year. She happens to be half black and American (they are British, it’s a real Meghan Markle situation).

Yesterday, they had a barbecue for Nick’s cousin’s birthday. Nick was manning the grill with his grandpa. People were lining up and they were putting pieces of meat on their plates. It was his SIL’s turn, and Nick’s grandpa said, “You’ll love this fried chicken, we made it just for you,” and gives her a piece. Nick laughs a bit.

Nick’s SIL goes, “that’s very stupid and not funny at all” and rolls her eyes. Nick said, “It’s a joke, lighten up a bit.” She says, “It’s not funny, it’s offensive.” Then she leaves and Nick’s grandpa says something about how he didn’t mean to hurt her feelings.

Later Nick’s brother says to Nick that Nick shouldn’t have defended their grandpa and Nick shouldn’t have laughed at his joke. Nick said she shouldn’t have been rude, and she’s much too sensitive. Nick reminded his brother that Nick’s grandpa jokes around about Nick’s girlfriend too (she’s Russian), and she laughs along. So it’s rather hypocritical of her to laugh at jokes about Nick’s GF’s background when she herself can’t take a joke just because it pertains to her. Plus, Nick said, he’s 97 years old, he’s from a different generation and they just have to cut him some slack.

Nick’s brother did not share Nick’s sentiments. He is very protective of his wife and already there has been some tension in the family due to it. She is a nice enough person but Nick does think she acted rather disproportionately.

1,"AITA for flirting with a girl while in a relationship | Nick didn't think he had done anything particularly bad until he mentioned this story to a friend who told him what he did was pretty shitty, so he thought he would post it here to get a group consensus. Also, this is a throwaway account as a couple of people know his real username. So, for a bit of background info, Nick has been with his girlfriend for just over 2 years and he is very happy with her. A few weeks ago Nick was in Waterloo tube station in London and made eye contact with an attractive girl while on an escalator, this happened a few more times with her smile growing bigger each time their eyes met. When they got off the escalator (she was a little ahead of him) she approached him and they began talking.

Nick considered telling her that he was already with someone, but he found it kind of fun to relive his days as a single man for a brief period, also, something like this has never happened to him before so it was quite exhilarating. After a couple of minutes she asked to exchange numbers which he did to keep up the illusion. They said goodbye and later that day she texted him, so he replied saying that he was already with someone and that he was sorry for misleading her. He also said she was very pretty, and if he was single he would have asked her out in an attempt not to hurt her feelings. She seemed to find it quite funny and texted back saying he had nothing to worry about, they haven't spoken since. Nick considered the whole thing to be no more than window-shopping, as he had absolutely no intention of cheating on his girlfriend. However, his friend said this was much worse than window shopping and a form of emotional cheating. So, AITA?",False,False,3,4,5,2,2,3,Loyalty,326
1,"AITA for making conversation with a girl Nick's girlfriend hates? | Nick's friends and he (10 people, just to give an idea of the size) got all together every once in a while to just hang out and have a good time. One of Nick's closer friends in the group had a girlfriend that his girlfriend hated to the bone. They called her Lisa.

Lisa had done some pretty questionable shit to Nick's girlfriend. Lisa was a nice person overall but had stuck her nose in some of his girlfriend's relationships too deep and had done some damage. Nick would spare the details, but he was fully on his girlfriend's side in this. They couldn't totally cut Lisa off though since she was the girlfriend of one of the guys.

Anyway, while they were all hanging out, Lisa started talking to Nick and they just had a normal conversation. Nick was a pretty easy going guy so he asked the usual ""how is everything"", made a few jokes, they showed each other some funny memes on their phone, then the rest of the party continued. It lasted like 10 minutes Nick would say.

Nick's girlfriend the next day started telling him how upset she was that Nick ""fed Lisa the attention she craves so much"", and how Nick shouldn't crack jokes with her and make conversation with her. She said Nick should just be blunt with her and give the shortest replies possible whenever it was his turn to talk.

Nick was there to have fun. He also didn't want to disrespect his friend's girlfriend by being a dick to her. To top it off, Nick didn't wanna start any bad vibes in that party just to please his girlfriend. He could probably find a way to do it subtly if they were in a club or something, but they were literally just 10, in a house.

1,"AITA for saying that Nick's kid won't treat Nick's step ""family"" like family? | Nick's parents got divorced when he was 10. By the time he was 14 both of them had found new partners. Nick's mother found a single dude and got married to him, while Nick's father found a single mother with 2 kids. Both Nick's parents pushed the fact that everyone should treat their partners and in Nick's father's case his partner's kids as family members. Nick was very much against that but he rolled with it as best as he could until he was able to live away from them.

Now, Nick has been living on his own with a long term girlfriend of his. They don't want to get married but they wanted to have a kid together and she's now pregnant. While delivering the news to Nick's parents he told them that he would prefer that this was something shared by the family only and by that he meant his mother, father and his 2 sisters.

This piece of information was not well received, even by Nick's two sisters who were very vocal about him excluding their other ""siblings"" who would all be very happy with the news. Nick explained that his kid would not grow up treating the others like family because they were not his family. They were his parent's family and that had nothing to do with him.

Nick's parents have been trying to change his mind about this because they feel like going along with it would be a slap on everyone's faces and it was unfair of him to put them in such position. While speaking with Nick's girlfriend she says he's free to deal with his family in any way he sees fit but he should probably back down on this and give it more thought.",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,307
1,"Nick is upset at his friend Chris who is bailing on a weekend away with friends to go to Chris's unexpected Job Orientation. | Two friends (Chris and Tom) and Nick bought tickets to go to a convention this weekend around six months ago as soon as tickets went live. They were all excited to go during the summer months and it was talked about quite a bit. Chris offered his car so they could drive to the convention and save money by not having to rent a car or pay for tickets.

After the start of the semester, Nick's friend Chris started hunting for jobs. Chris got a position as a part-time EMT and Nick's other friend Tom, and Nick were obviously very excited for Chris. The job however, has an orientation that is the same weekend as their convention. Chris decided to bail on the commitment they made 6 months ago to go to Chris's job orientation. Now they have no way to get to their convention unless they spend money to rent a car, which is a big unexpected expense. Chris offered to pay half of their rental car fee but as their friend they want Chris there with them too.

The reason Nick is upset is because there is another job orientation in a month that Chris could attend, but Chris is afraid of the possibility that the company will revoke the job offer if Chris decides to postpone the orientation by a month. To this Nick said to contact the company and former employees to see if it was something they might do but Chris has yet to do so.

AITA for Nick being upset that Chris backed out on a commitment they made half a year ago? The commitment is more important to Nick than the money.",False,False,2,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,302
1,"Is Judy the asshole for confronting her for trying to cause problems with her bf??????? | What happened is following:

Judy's future mother in law invited the ex gf of her bf to stay with her during this time because she had no family here and apparently her apartment is shitty. Now Judy hates that girl. Judy feels like she intrudes into every fucking thing in this fucking family. Like.... Judy gets it. You guys were together for like 10 years. But you don't have kids!! You don't have to stay in each other's life. Just fuck off. Judy and her bf have been together for 1 year now and it is getting serious they have talked about marriage and family and Judy just wants to be fucking respected! Yes Judy doesn't have a fucking PhD like she does but what the fuck??????

Well when Judy's boyfriend told her what happened Judy was livid. Judy asked why he didn't demand his family respect her by treating her like their future daughter in law and not her!!! They have been broker up for almost 2 years. What the fuck?! If she didn't move away Judy is sure she would be pushed into every fucking family gathering. It is hard enough because Judy doesn't fit in that family. But tough luck! Their son chose Judy.

So whatever where Judy might be the asshole is when Judy confronted that girl. Judy asked her why she was intruding in the family so much and that it seems like she is desperate to get back together with Judy's boyfriend.
She just blocked Judy on Instagram and of corse snitched on Judy and Judy's bf told Judy to just stop and let it go. His mother and her a friend's and yadeyade yade. Is Judy really an asshole for wanting some basic respect???????",False,False,2,4,5,3,1,2,Loyalty,301
1,"AITA for not telling Nick’s (Possibly Ex) Fiancé about Nick’s son? | Throwaway, obvious reasons.

It’s kind of weird to post this to reddit, but here is Nick’s conundrum.

Nick was going to get married soonish to a lovely woman, or rather was. Nick had had lots of issues in life, just about certain lifestyles Nick had had in the past, a real party type kid and in that time Nick had had many relationships and one-night stands.

This was a really long time ago and Nick had changed since then into a more mature man, and had committed himself to this woman Nick loved, but recently, Nick bumped into an Ex while on a work trip and she had a 10 year old with her, and Nick was very sure it was his. Nick’s co-worker eventually pieced it together and he knows too.

Nick’s Ex had changed a lot too and became a mature woman herself, so they caught up and she told Nick that he was the father of her child and Nick felt like his world had turned upside down. She opted to not tell Nick, because of the lifestyle he had lived.

This is big, and Nick wanted to tell his fiancé but his Ex told him if he wanted to have a relationship with his son, that nobody could know he was the father, she guessed out of embarrassment or something, and that included his fiancé.

Nick was devasted, but of course he wanted a relationship with him so he decided not to tell his fiancé.

And, well, she found out when she got pretty suspicious of Nick’s co-workers behaviour, and found out that he hadn’t planned on telling her despite his Ex’s conditions and now she might leave him.

1,"Is Nick the asshole for warning his neighbor about his wife? | Nick lives in a condo. The building has 12 units, so the residents know their neighbors very well. Nick is very friendly with the couple that lives across the hall. Nick is single, and they often invite him to dinner with them. Nick hangs out with the husband pretty often. Nick and the husband have game nights, and hang out at bars together. A few days before Christmas Nick saw another male come and pick up the wife while the husband was at work. They went out for a couple of hours and came back. Nick saw them hugging. Nick told him to come by Nick's house when he got off of work for a beer so that Nick could tell him what Nick saw. Later that evening Nick told him and he didn’t believe Nick. He was devastated, and went to confront his wife. They got into a big fight, but in the end it turned out just to be a cousin that came in from out of town to visit her. They went out for lunch. He and this cousin know each other, he was a groomsmen in his wedding. Nick apologized profusely to the wife and him. Nick tried to explain that he was just looking out for a friend. She was not having it and cursed Nick out. Nick told her that she was being extremely rude and hurtful. She doesn’t want Nick to hang out with her husband anymore, effectively ruining their friendship. Is Nick the asshole here or is she? Nick tried to apologize to her, and explain his reasoning.

Nick and his girlfriend have been together for about a year and a half now, and they have already been on one week long trip together to France earlier this year. It was amazing. Nick leaves for his trip in a few weeks time, and Nick told his girlfriend a few weeks ago too. However, ever since Nick told her, she has been extremely upset with Nick that Nick isn't taking her on such an amazing trip. There are 2 Nick has in his defence, firstly, although Nick wouldn't say this to her, but Nick doesn't think they're ready to spend a month together alone. Secondly, Nick thinks it's a dick move to cancel such a trip only a few weeks in advance because Nick knows how much his friend is excited for it. Now, Nick only speaks to his friend about once a week via text now because they live very far away now and so can't see each other (another reason why Nick is excited), however, they were best friends for 16 years before this. Nick doesn't think Nick is being unreasonable but some of Nick's friends and Nick's girlfriend say Nick is the asshole. So?",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty,284

K's girlfriends mom posted something on FB saying some stupid corny shit about how she's going to be a grandmother. So Nick called K and just straight up asked him, he said yes but not to tell anyone.

Their friend group have known each other for about 11 years so they are all very close. Yesterday friend M and his girlfriend B and Nick went to the beach. B was asking Nick if he knew anything about if K's gf was pregnant because she also saw the FB post and had noticed that K's gf didnt drink at any of the past events. All Nick said is ""he can't answer that."" Nick has lied before about much smaller things but apart of Nick really wanted to tell them. They assumed because Nick can't answer that it is true; Nick never confirmed it and switched the subject.

M and B told K's gf that if she needed any help or just needed someone that they would be there for her.

K msged Nick telling him how he can't trust Nick with any of his secrets, which Nick rebuttaled by saying that K didnt tell Nick it and that T and Nick had to figure the shit out on their own.

So the next time Nick saw his friend, Nick immediately told her about her boyfriend's plan and she was happy about it as she wanted to marry him. Nick told her not to tell the boyfriend and pretend to be surprised and she agreed.

However it didn't go according to plan as Nick's friend couldn't hold it in anymore and let it slip that she knows he is going to propose. The boyfriend confronted Nick and they had a huge argument.

A month later, Judy's sister Ashley and her boyfriend announced they were also engaged and had set their wedding date, which unfortunately falls on the same day as Kelly’s wedding next September. Kelly is getting married on the other side of the country, where her family lives, so it would be impossible to attend both weddings.

Ashley wants Judy to be her maid of honor, but Judy told her Judy was sorry and that Judy had already made a commitment to Kelly and it wouldn’t be right to back out. Judy asked if she would be willing to move her wedding date to a different weekend, and she said she can’t because she and her fiance already put down a nonrefundable deposit on the venue.

Ashley is really upset with Judy because Judy has only known Kelly for a year and she thinks her wedding should take priority because she’s family. Judy's parents agree with her and keep pressuring Judy to drop out of Kelly’s wedding.

Nick's wife just recently got put on bed rest and is 8 months pregnant. She said that Nick can’t go to the wedding. Nick can’t just skip his brother’s wedding. Especially when he is the best man. The original plan was to fly over two days early, stay three days, and fly back.

Nick moved the flight to night of the day before and afternoon of the day after.

Nick's wife is still saying he can’t go. Her friends are willing to come over and help, and worst come to worst her parents can drive up and stay a day or two. It’s not like she’ll be all alone.

There was an issue and Nick was late getting to the hospital, not by a ton though. There was still 3+ hours of labor until the baby came.
