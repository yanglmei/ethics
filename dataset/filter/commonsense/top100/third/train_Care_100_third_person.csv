0,"AITA for not giving into Nick's older roommate's demands about his girlfriend? For context, Nick is a 23 year old living in a subletted room of an apartment of a 43 year old professor. No contract, Nick just gives her money each month. When Nick moved in, he told her that his girlfriend stays overnight twice a week. She said no problem to this. His girlfriend and Nick are both very quiet and friendly, and they mostly keep to themselves by watching TV in Nick's room. His girlfriend has been spending more time during the day on Saturdays (like she'll be in Nick's room Saturday afternoon - Sunday afternoon), but she's actually only stayed overnight once a week since Nick has lived there. They try to invite Nick's roommate to go places whenever they go out, but she always says no. When Nick first met his roommate his girlfriend did nOT spend this much time at Nick's old apartment, but since Nick moved closer to her they now can spend more time together. So Nick's life has just slightly changed since moving to this apartment; Nick promises he didn't intentionally omit how much she spends in the apartment. Total, she's probably IN Nick's ROOM with the door closed for 20 hours a week including sleeping.

Nick's roommate also didn't tell him that there's a chore list of about 50 things that needs to get done every week. No problem, Nick is happy to do it if it'll make her happy and make the apartment look nice. Nick has also driven dinner over to her office when she's been stressed about work. Nick has tried to be nice.

They're both super busy so his girlfriend comes over once during the weekday from 8:30 - 10:30, and then she comes over to Nick's room on Saturday afternoon around 2; they'll go get some food for a few hours because it stresses Nick's roommate that his girlfriend is in Nick's room. Then they'll come back and watch TV for the rest of the night in Nick's room. GF's then there until Sunday around 3 PM. For context, they are now in Nick's room the ENTIRE time with the door closed and the TV on low, but they used to occasionally do homework in the living room or eat in the kitchen. At first, she didn't like them eating in the kitchen or being in the living room (common spaces) when she got home which Nick totally understood, so she asked them to eat in Nick's room and not cook in the kitchen so no big deal; they now order out and eat in Nick's room. Also, his girlfriend has never showered there; she showers before at her home so she doesn't have to use their water/shower while she's there.

Roommate has confessed that she often can't tell if they are in Nick's room or not unless his gf's car is out on the street because they are quiet. Fast forward, Nick's roommate's work has gotten really stressful and she now tells him that it bothers her that his girlfriend is in Nick's room on Saturday because she ""can't focus with more than one person in the apartment"" and she asked that his girlfriend leaves by 12 PM. She also asked that Nick tell her his schedule of when she is and isn't in the apartment. Nick now gives her 24 hours notice and tries to tell her their schedule. Nick is a little annoyed at this point because he is trying to be accommodating, but whatever. They normally leave at like 2 PM now to go to the library on Sundays because Nick is not gonna have a curfew imposed on him at 23, but he is doing his best.

Now the kicker. What really hurt was that one of Nick's students (Nick teaches 2nd grade in a bad neighborhood) was shot and killed instantly on a Friday. Nick texted his roommate that his gf and he would be in his room all day Saturday because Nick was mourning and crying and grieving because you know, Nick's kid was a victim of gun violence. She says she's sorry and blah blah blah, she's nice. THEN Sunday at around 2 PM, Nick managed to leave the apartment and an hour later (3 PM) while they were out, Nick got this text message.

""if possible I’d prefer that you and gf not spend more time here together today. I’m not feeling well and it stresses me out when you guys are here on the weekends, especially since lately it seems to be the whole weekend and not just overnight. I understand you wanted more time yesterday but you did not ask for today and I’ve already asked before that you and Koryne not stay past noon on Sundays. This is my home and I need to have a space in which I feel comfortable.""

When Nick saw that text, he just broke down crying. It definitely was not the whole weekend? Nick was heartbroken that someone could be so unforgiving when she knew Nick was upset about his kid dying.

It's not just her home; Nick also pays rent there. Nick doesn't know. AMTA? Nick was tearing up while re-reading that text. Nick is moving out at the end of December which he is very thankful for; he is just nervous for these next few weeks. Nick's job is really hard sometimes ( re: Nick's student died) and his girlfriend is Nick's rock through it all. Nick can't do this without her. Also Nick keeps saying in his room because whether or not his girlfriend is there, Nick is in his room with the door closed. So it doesn't really affect the roommate in anyway.

TL;DR Roomate was ok with gf staying over twice a week, she's actually not. She gave Nick a list of 50 things to clean every week and Nick does them. She didn't like them in common spaces so they don't hang out there anymore. She told Nick to give her his schedule so she knows when they'll be in the apartment and Nick has done that. Nick has tried to be accommodating to his roommate about his girlfriend, and roommate was ok with his girlfriend until her work got stressful. She sent a really cold heartless text to Nick about his girlfriend being in his room 2 days after one of Nick's 7-year-old students was shot. AITA?",False,False,5,4,2,3,1,2,Care,1054
0,"AITA for not wanting to deal with Nick's best friend’s chaotic life anymore? Nick [F26] has been friends with this person [F25] since they were 13. She is a great friend in terms of being there to listen. Her family and her have always been poor. Her mother has never been a good role model - keeping publicly abusive relationships, drinking constantly and not being there for her daughter. Her family life over all has always been hard. She has dealt with depression and anxiety her whole life.

Nick's friend has never been able to keep a job more than a couple months since high school. She just quits randomly. Nick had paid thousands of dollars for her over the years in the form of rent, food and entertainment so that she can enjoy nights out with their friend group.

She has two children who she sees every other week because her and the dad are separated. When she doesn’t have the kids, she goes on drinking benders. During these, she will start shit with her family members and boyfriends causing huge fights. She just got a DUI a couple months ago and is now on probation but is refusing to stop drinking or doing drugs.

She has wanted to kill herself for years, and has acted on it tens of times. She will blow up everyone’s phones saying she is taking a bottle of pills and then not answer anyone’s calls. This causes her loved ones to leave responsibilities like work, racing around town while in tears trying to find her and getting the cops involved. Last episode she had called Nick for the first time saying she was going to kill herself which sent Nick into a panic and Nick had to go track her down thinking Nick's friend would be dead by the time Nick got there. Every time is has turned out she didn’t actually take pills and she was saying/doing crazy shit cause she had been drinking. Nick has stopped inviting her out with new people because she will show up wasted and embarrass Nick.

Nick was already distancing herself a bit because Nick couldn’t emotionally deal with the chaos, but the last straw was when Nick foolishly let her borrow a few hundred dollars. She had a new job and seemed to be doing well, so Nick told her yes but Nick needed it back in two weeks. She promised Nick she’d have the money back to Nick “100%”. She said she needed help because her kids’ dad fucked her over on daycare. Turns out she quit that job the day prior (after 1 week of being there) and that she actually needed that money for rent. She told Nick all of this a week later and genuinely didn’t seem to realize that her story was much different than what she told Nick before. That deadline is now three months ago. She has brought up paying Nick back once. She got another job a couple weeks ago and Nick heard from a friend she already quit it.

She’s had a history of dating physically and mentally abusive men. Yesterday Nick got a call from her mom asking if Nick’d seen her because she hadn’t come home. Nick said no and automatically knew what this was about. The night prior she had texted Nick bragging how she cheated on her boyfriend. This boyfriend has blatantly said to their group of friends that he’s not afraid to beat a woman. Nick knew he was evil. Turns out her sister told him that she had cheated on him, he drove to her house, broke in, smashed her phone and beat her. She now has bruises all over her and is (hopefully) getting a restraining order. Nick was not surprised at all, Nick had told Nick's friend he’d beat her one day and Nick's friend (who is also one of her bfs) didn’t believe Nick. He is an overly-obvious abusive person. Yelling at her constantly in front of strangers, acting crazy all of the time.

In summary, Nick is caught up because Nick has suffered from crippling anxiety and depression but it’s never brought this type of destruction onto everyone around Nick or Nick. It seems at this point she’s choosing all of these awful things to happen to her at this point. (Besides being beat obviously). Blatantly self-sabotaging. Which Nick knows can be from mental illness. Where do you draw the line blaming it on mental illness? Nick doesn’t want to be dragged into this anymore. Nick cares about her and her wellbeing but it’s been 10 years of this chaos.

Something happens every week. And every week either she or her mom will call Nick to talk about it, thinking that Nick needs to be informed of what happened. The same shit that always happens. Nothing ever changes, and in fact gets worse every year. It brings a lot of stress onto to Nick and has ruined a lot of days for Nick, crying, leaving social setting to go make sure she’s okay or sitting around in anxiety over how she’s doing.

0,"AITA for telling Nick's boyfriend off? | Nick (20f) is a stay at home parent to Nick and her boyfriend's (24m) 4 mo old baby. Her boyfriend works over night & sleeps up until an hour before he has to go work again, so of course Nick is responsible for their daughter 90% of the time.

He just got back to work as he spent the entire year that Nick was pregnant unemployed just because. He is qualified and can easily get a job but he chose not to. He was able to do this because a few years ago Nick was in a bad car wreck and received a decent amount of settlement money for Nick's injuries. The whole time up until now, Nick and her boyfriend have been paying the rent with Nick's savings. Even now that he works he hasn’t contributed to rent, the only thing he pays for is when Nick and her boyfriend go out to eat.

For the past week, Nick has had extreme migraines & dizziness so Nick scheduled a doctors appt. Nick spent the night at Nick's grandma’s because the appt was much closer & Nick figured it would be easier to wake up there since Nick had been feeling bad & would have to drive less in the morning.

Coincidentally, his mom & Nick's grandma live in the same complex. After he got off of work, his plan was to go to his moms to sleep. They also agreed the night before that he would watch the baby while Nick went to Nick's appt.

He gets out of work at 6 AM. Nick woke up at 10 AM, appt was at 11:30 AM. It took Nick a while to get out of bed because of the migraines & dizziness, & Nick also got up several times in the night to feed/change the baby. Nick figured by that time he was already asleep but Nick would call him to wake him up to let him know Nick was going to be leaving for Nick's appt soon.

Remember that his mom & Nick's grandma live in the same complex, meaning it would have taken him less than 2 minutes to stop by & pick up the baby. Nick asked if he could do this because Nick was very dizzy, Nick still had to eat, get Nick ready, & get the baby ready. Nick would’ve been able to save a little bit of time & effort if he would have just stopped by to pick up the baby. If Nick had to drop the baby off, Nick would’ve spent more time also because his mom talks Nick's ear off even if Nick says Nick is in a rush.

He said he was not going to come pick her up because he was “trying to sleep” that he would send his mother instead. His mother has spinal issues and cannot walk down the stairs, especially not with a heavy car seat and diaper bag. Aside from that, Nick would’ve had to remove the car base from Nick's car & install it in his mother's, which was going to take Nick even more time & was going to be hard for Nick to do with Nick's symptoms.

Nick gets he works over night, & he was “trying to sleep” but he had been home for the past 4 hrs but when Nick asked for a favor that Nick never asks for, he’s trying to sleep. They ended up getting into a bad argument & said some ugly things to each other.

Is Nick the asshole for telling him off? Nick has built up over time which Nick has previously communicated to him but he brushes all of it off.

0,"AITA for using his wheelchair despite his parents' telling him not to? | Nick is 21 and Nick is starting uni. Nick has moved back in with his parents. Nick uses a chair in public. Nick does have the ability to walk, and tends to walk around the house because it is carpeted and has stairs (it's a struggle for Nick).  

What happened with his legs- Nick is weak. Nick's legs collapse frequently and even if they don't, Nick is in constant pain 24/7 if he walks. To the point of crying. Nick has been to his GP and has been instructed to STAY IN THE CHAIR, until they figure out what the fuck is up with him. Nick is not stated as disabled on any of his docs because he has no diagnosis yet, but has docs from his GP for chair use.  

Now the real meat of this is his parents. When they (S/O and Nick) were moving back in with them, they said to take one of the wheelchairs in the airport to skip ahead of the line. Nick then had to drop the bombshell that he actually has his own chair and has to use it because his legs are crap. Nick's parents did not like this.  

Some info, they see him as an abusive person because he refused to bend over and let them continously treat him like shit (making decisions for him, cutting him off from his family). Saying that he took advantage of them. Anyway, since he has moved back in, they are insistent about him not using his chair. On outings with them and his siblings, they'd force him to walk to look 'normal' and would make comments like ""see? you're fine!"" When then ten minutes later he has to sit down over and over and then pop a few painkillers to just not cry. He has tried to stand his ground but they refuse to listen.  

Last night, Nick was talking about his classmates to them, he was attending everyday, using public transport to get to his campus. His mom then asks him to never use his chair again, saying he shouldn't take advantage of people and he should stop pretending and just be ""normal"". His dad goes into this rant about how he just wants to take advantage of people's kindness, stating he is a cruel person for using the chair. Nick tried telling his dad that being disabled is difficult and he then said ""then stop pretending and just work through it!"" Nick insisted that it's too painful to ever do that and he has to listen to his doctor until they figure out what's up. He went on about how karma will bite him in the ass and that he will be unloved, jobless in the world cause of the chair. He then instructed him to ditch the chair in the next week, and to lie to all his mates that he is on medication and can walk. Nick refused. Until he stayed up at night thinking about it and letting it get to him, because he CAN walk and people do help him.  

What if they're right? Should he suck it up and just pop 4K mg a day and limp until his muscles get better? His S/O stands by the fact he needs his chair and will stand up for him the next time but he doesn't know if he wants them to do that?

0,"AITA for telling Nick's GF's sister not to touch Nick's newborn son because she insulted him, Nick, and Nick's GF | A bit of backstory; Nick and his GF have been together for 3 years and a year ago they found out she was pregnant. Nick will admit at the beginning Nick was not supportive, its his biggest regret. Nick did a 180 when she was about 4 months along and since he was born he is the best thing in Nick's world. Nick's GF and her sister have always been close, they tell each other everything. Her sister has always been a bit off, thinks she's never in the wrong EVER and the entire world is against her. 

About a month ago, when Nick's son was 4 weeks old, she was angry that her Mom was not giving her enough attention (she bought herself a puppy a few weeks before Nick's son came along. The puppy is a nightmare, and she doesn't discipline it or even take care of it). Since she was not getting attention from her mom she got her puppy and started saying ""Look at the baby. Who's a good baby?"" To the dog and brought him over to Nick's son. The puppy is feisty and squirmed almost scratching Nick's son in his grandmothers arms. Nick got mad and took Nick's son into Nick's GF's room (they've been staying with her mom since they live far away). When Nick walked out of the room she called Nick's son a dumb baby and said he was ugly. She came into the room later and told Nick to give her the baby, Nick told her no. Nick's GF agreed Nick did the right thing, but her sister decided Nick hates her and is taking it out on her mom. She screams at her mom constantly about nothing and told her mom that no one can drive her mom's car (they have been borrowing it while they are here to get around) not even her mom can drive it only her and she will drop her mom at work and keep the keys during the day. 

After a month of her screaming and saying everyone is ruining her life she decided that her dog is more important than her nephew. Her brother was playing with her dog, which she didnt like, he was rubbing its belly while she screamed ""STOP RAPPING MY DOG!!! IM CALLING THE POLICE IF YOU DON'T STOP NOW!!! WHY DONT YOU GO AND TOUCH (GF'S NAME)'S SON'S DICK INSTEAD!!!"". Nick's GF had to stop Nick because Nick was livid. Nick decided then that she would not see his son until she got right. 

Last night they were at their friends house, they are a few days from flying back home. She texts Nick's GF angry because her brother told her Nick doesnt like her. She started saying some really fucked up things to Nick's GF about her, Nick's son, and Nick. Nick's GF told Nick what she was saying and showed Nick the texts. She told Nick's GF that Nick doesnt love Nick's son because when they first found out Nick wanted to abort. Nick regrets thinking it everyday, he is the best thing and Nick doesnt know what Nick would do without him anymore. Nick snapped and called her some really bad things to Nick's GF and Nick almost cried because it hurt that bad. Nick has now refused to let her come visit them and told his GF she should stop talking to her.

0,"AITA for blocking Nick's mother out of Nick's life and refusing to give her a second chance? | So, this was about a couple years ago, but as of recently, Nick has been feeling guilty because of it.

&#x200B;

Nick should give some backstory first. Nick's mother wasn't the best person; she acted like she loved Nick sometimes, but a lot of the time she would be quite abusive in the emotional sense. For example, when Nick was learning how to drive she would constantly make comments about how Nick was purposely trying to harm and kill both her and Nick's sister by purposely trying to crash the car. Not only that, but she would constantly tell Nick how terrible of a person Nick is, how Nick was compliant with the ""people"" trying to ""get"" her, and she would use that as an excuse to punish Nick severely for weeks at a time. There's more, but Nick has trouble addressing this stuff.

&#x200B;

Eventually, Nick broke down and couldn't take it anymore. Nick wanted away from her as much as possible. Nick called Nick's dad, told him Nick wanted to move in with him and then proceeded to tell Nick's mother the same. Instead of becoming angry, she tried everything she could to keep Nick from leaving (preparing Nick's favorite meals every day, tried to enroll Nick in a new high school, begged Nick to not pack Nick's things, etc. Everything but apologize for how she treated Nick). Nick ended up agreeing to call every day while Nick lived with Nick's dad, but this didn't last long. While texting with Nick's sister, Nick ended up learning that it was Nick's mother pretending to be Nick's sister. After this Nick was done. Nick called Nick's mother, told her off and then ended by telling her Nick wanted nothing to do with her anymore. Nick blocked her number and Nick thought that was that.

&#x200B;

But as of recently, Nick's mother has been going to therapy and receiving medication for bipolar disorder. Nick keeps being told that she's doing better and that Nick should reach out and try to reconnect, if not for her sake, for Nick's sister's and Nick's grandfather's sake (Nick can't see them as much because of Nick's mother and Nick's grandfather is quite old and likely doesn't have many years left.) But Nick wants nothing to do with her anymore; she betrayed Nick's trust on several occasions as well as gave Nick longstanding problems with depression. But Nick feels a little conflicted. Nick feels as if Nick is the asshole for not giving her a second chance, or at least not having some relationship with her so Nick could spend more time with Nick's sister and grandfather, but yet Nick is still firm on Nick's decision to not want to have anything to do with her.

&#x200B;

So, Nick guesses Nick should ask you all, is Nick the asshole for not giving her the second chance or is Nick justified in not wanting to see her ever again. Most of Nick's family feel as if Nick should reach out, but Nick does mostly feel justified. Though, no one in Nick's family knows the full extent of the story, so that's why Nick is posting this here.

Nick has been working as a restaurant manager for over 10 years but in September this year started at a new place as a deputy manager to take a step back from the stress of being the general manager. Nick's last general manager job caused her to end up in a deep depression & so Nick thought Nick would be better off as a deputy.

Turns out Nick was wrong. Nick's job started off great with a promise of having at least 2 evenings a week free, one night so Nick could play Nick's sport (which helps keep Nick's mental health in check) & Nick helped the GM with all the rotas & was given lots of praise for the job Nick has been doing. Recently Nick hasn't been getting any evenings off in the week, Nick's shift patterns are usually 3-close, 12-10 or 12-close, meaning Nick is only free to do anything else on Nick's days off (i.e. see friends, see Nick's boyfriend, see Nick's family, Christmas shopping, tidy the house etc) & worst of all Nick has been put to work on the days Nick plays Nick's sport, Nick's team aren’t particularly happy with her!

On top of that Nick's general manager is an AH. He never says hello as Nick comes in, he never thanks anyone for their hard work even though all their reviews have been amazing, he constantly is moaning or telling people off for things that most of the time aren’t even wrong, they’re just not his way (his way changes every week Nick will never get it right) & people are now fearful of coming to work as they know they will be shouted at as soon as they walk through the door.

Only recently has Nick managed to end up in his bad books (reasons unknown Nick has been doing Nick's job the same way since the start). He has undermined Nick on the rotas, twice now after Nick spent hours of Nick's time doing them he has then scribbled them out in front of Nick's face & said Nick has been too nice to staff so he will re-do them. Nick accepted Nick would be working all over Christmas because Nick knows the industry but asked if Nick could maybe not do the whole day Christmas Eve or start a little later on Christmas Day to spend a small amount of time with Nick's family, instead he actually extended Nick's shifts from what Nick had suggested they could be. He also extended some of Nick's other shifts that week meaning Nick was working all day on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day & the 2 days after that as well, no time to see Nick's family or Nick's heavily pregnant sister who would be visiting.

Nick could go on forever about the things he has done to Nick lately but long story short, Nick is now having daily panic attacks about going to work & has had to return to Nick's GP for help with Nick's depression. Both the GP & Nick's parents think the job is not worth Nick's happiness but Nick knows the staff (who Nick thinks are all great btw it’s just the manager who isn’t) will be short over Christmas without Nick & the GM may have to cancel his holiday he has booked from Boxing Day.

It was a shotgun wedding on account of Nick's older sister. When Nick was a kid they'd argue constantly and dad pretty much would live with them for a year, move out for a year, move back in for a year, move back out for a year, and every time they'd say it was over, they were getting divorced, they couldn't make it work, and then dad would move back in and things would resume. They'd also try and bring Nick and her sister into arguments and get them to say whose side they were on. Nick moved out as soon as she reached 18 because she was just so tired of hearing them fight all the time. They made it clear they were only together for Nick and her sister, and Nick and her sister told them at one point that they could split up with no hard feelings from them, but they didn't believe them and thought they were ""putting on a brave face"" for their sake so they stayed together. They refused to see a marriage counselor or any sort of therapist, separate or together, as they felt it was a waste of time, money, and energy.

Nick's son was 7 years old. Nick lived within 90 minutes of her parents' house, and after her son's father left they offered to help her out with childcare. Nick refused initially as he was in preschool so he had someone to go to, but when the school holidays rolled around Nick had to ask them for some help. One of the first times he was with them for the day (he was 3 or 4 at this point) he came home and told Nick they'd spent the day fighting, tried to make him pick a side, and he didn't want to go back. Nick told both of them that spending the day yelling at each other in front of him and dragging him into their fight was unacceptable. They tried to pull Nick's sister into the argument and she offered to watch Nick's son rather than send him back there.

On Saturday around 10 Nick got a call asking her to come into work for a meeting at 12. Nick asked her sister if she could watch her son but it was too short notice. Nick called her parents and asked if they could meet her at Nick's town center, and just watch him for a couple hours and take him to the beach or round the shops. They agreed. Nick was gone for approx 1hr30 and in that time they had an argument. Nick's son said there was no yelling but they'd tried to make him pick sides again.

Nick gave it a lot of thought and rang them today and told them that they could only see her son from here on out if they were apart, and if they ever tried to pull him into an argument again they wouldn't be allowed to see either of them.

Nick felt justified because at the end of the day she was talking about Nick's relationship with her parents and her son, however in the conversation they did make some valid points, including that Nick's son loved them and wanted to see them, they'd been together 3 decades, and Nick's dad had a sight issue that meant it wasn't safe for him to drive after dark so he couldn't come alone until summer.

0,"AITA If Nick Chooses A Random Couple For Adoption Than Stepsister? | 
So Nick (21F) is in her junior year of college. Nick’s been extremely careful on not getting pregnant and has tried all avanues. Her IUD moved and she almost died so she had to get it removed, the implant in her arm left a rash and started to burn so she had it removed, so Nick and her FWB started using the calendar and condom method which is basically when she isn’t ovulating they would use the pull out method and when she was they would use a condom and a Plan B just for backup.

Well, Nick’s pregnant. She found out in the beginning of December that she is four weeks along. She knew immediately she didn’t want to keep the baby. Nick considered going through with an abortion via the pill. She got them but couldn’t do it. Nick knows that it was selfish, but until you’re in those shoes you never know how it truly feels.

So Nick decided adoption. She told her friend that she was planning on delivering the baby and she told Nick about her brother and her sister in law back in her home state that have been struggling with infertility and have been desperately trying to conceive a baby for years without fail. They FaceTimed a few times and Nick thinks they would be perfect parents for her baby. They’re both well educated with well paying jobs and an amazing home they could raise a baby in. It actually made Nick excited to be able to know that the baby will go to a family that so desperately wants them. Nick decided they would be a great fit and since they’re so far away, it’s like it never happened kinda thing.

Nick finally brought it up to her mom yesterday that she’s pregnant and everything else. Her mom’s first words were “What about Sylvia? Her and Jon would love a baby”. Nick’s older stepsister is 28 and infertile. She’s known this for years and they aren’t that close so Nick didn’t know if she ever planned on having a baby through other means.

Nick said no. Sylvia lives in the same city as Nick and Nick sees her during holidays and any other family gatherings. Nick doesn’t want to adopt the baby into her own family circle and still have to be in some form of its life. She would basically become the step aunt? Nick just prefers the idea of having a closed adoption in a far away state with a picture every once in a while. Her mom started gushing and called Sylvia immediately despite Nick’s protests who seemed really happy.

Nick told Sylvia that she doesn’t want to give the baby to her for the reasons she listed above and kind of already “promised” another couple that they could adopt the baby. Now Nick hasn’t gone through any legal channels via the other couple so it’s not like she HAS to do it, but she really wants to. Sylvia got upset and asked why Nick would choose a random couple that she knows nothing about versus her own “flesh and blood” (Their parents have only been married for 3 years and they never lived under the same roof as she was 25 then).

0,"AITA for hoping siblings will help care for Nick's dying mom | This is a throwaway account.

Nick's mom is 80 and Nick has been caring for her mom for 20 yrs. Nick's mom does not get enough social security to afford living on her own and Nick made the decision to be with her mom. Nick accepts responsibility for that. Nick's mom has begged Nick not to put her mom in a facility and Nick has honored that.

Nick is the youngest of 5 and Nick's siblings are a lot older than Nick. There is a lot of history here, but Nick has to keep it short. Nick will gladly answer any requests for more info.

3 of Nick's siblings do very well financially and the other one gets by OK. 2 of them live close by and the other 2 live in another state. None of them have helped out with Nick's mom over the years and Nick accepted that. Nick has been a single mom for 24 yrs and things have been tough at times.

Nick's mom has been very ill in the past. Nick has worked 2 jobs and Nick's adult son moved back home to help. Nick's siblings who live close by did not help with getting Nick's mom to dr appts, caring for her mom at home, or any financials. Despite this, they want to remain in contact, be kept informed of Nick's mom's status, and have a say in Nick's mom's affairs.

Nick's son, who was working and going to college full time, quit school to help. Nick did not ask him to do this and it kills Nick that he did. When Nick's mom got better, Nick's son landed a better job, saved up money, and prepared to move out again.

Nick's mom then became severely ill with diabetes and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Nick's son stayed home, Nick left Nick's job and withdrew Nick's retirement money so Nick could stay home to provide the 24 hr care Nick's mom needs. Nick's retirement money has since run out and now the burden is falling completely on Nick's son.

Nick's siblings think Nick should be home caring for their mom and they said they would help, but since having this discussion they claim they do not have extra money or time. Nick’s been happy that they are successful and can afford many luxuries. Nick told them that Nick doesn't think anyone is obligated to provide assistance, but Nick would like for them to make their intentions clear so there are no false expectations or angry reactions to decisions Nick may have to make (e.g. one of Nick's siblings was unhappy with potential funeral plans due to Nick's financial constraints). Nick has to get a job and cannot leave Nick's mom alone. Nick's mom probably does not have long to live so they’re not talking about a situation that will drag on for years. Nick can try to work overnights while Nick's son is home, but Nick doesn't know when Nick will get any sleep due to so many dr appts. Nick's siblings have the resources to help, but they are not doing so. Yet they cry on the phone when discussing Nick's mom's impending death.

AITA for Nick thinking her siblings should sacrifice a few luxuries in order to help keep their mom happy in her final days and/or the ones who live close by at least help with getting her mom to appts and taking turns caring for her mom while Nick works since they claim to care and want to be involved in decision making?",False,False,5,4,3,2,1,4,Care,591
0,"AITA For Cutting Nick’s “Tough Love” Mom Out Of Nick’s Life? | Nick is a 43F single mom of a 13M. Nick has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past 12 years. About two months ago, Nick was having a terrible period in her life, and made some changes all at once. Nick quit her job, moved back to her hometown, ended her relationship, and went off all her meds. It was a very hard couple of months for both Nick and her son. They are both starting to feel better and things are getting back to a good place. Nick is on different meds and has started a new job. Nick's son is doing pretty good at school and is happy to be back in Nick's hometown.

The issue is that Nick's ex-fiancé got ahold of Nick's mother when they first moved out to let Nick's mother know what was happening and that Nick was not in a good place. Nick's son also reached out to Nick's mother when he was feeling particularly down and wanted someone to talk to. Nick's mother basically blew Nick's son off and never bothered to check back on Nick's son again. Nick's mother never contacted Nick to check in either.

Some backstory: Nick's mother believes in “tough love” and “codependency” and believes this means that it’s ok to just basically ignore her children (all 3 of Nick's mother's children are adults) if they are struggling, or unhappy, or even need to just talk. By ignore, Nick means Nick's mother has already cut Nick's youngest brother (39 yrs) out of Nick's mother's life because he struggles with PTSD and alcoholism and will not check himself into a hospital which is what Nick's mother thinks he should do. So Nick's mother refuses to have anything to do with Nick's brother and basically pretends he doesn’t exist.

In regards to Nick, Nick's mother abandoned Nick at age 1 to be with the man Nick's mother cheated on Nick's father with and Nick's mother's two babies Nick's mother had with him. Nick's mother did eventually get visitation rights and Nick saw Nick's mother on the weekends for years. Nick's mother was physically and verbally abusive for most of Nick's childhood towards Nick and Nick's (half-) brothers as well. Nick's mother smoked pot constantly and drank a lot too.

Over the years Nick has done a lot of therapy and pretty much got over most of Nick's issues with Nick's mother, and has had what Nick thought was a pretty good relationship with Nick's mother for about 15 years. It was always up and down, but Nick just went with the flow and up to now, Nick's mother has been a decent grandmother.

Fast forward to now. Nick's mother hasn’t spoken one word to Nick since Nick told Nick's mother Nick quit her job two months ago, and as Nick mentioned, Nick's mother blew Nick's son off when he tried contacting Nick's mother when he was upset and worried about Nick. Nick honestly never expected Nick's mother to help Nick in any way, but a check-in to see if they were ok would have been nice. Now that Nick knows Nick's mother blew off Nick's son, Nick is furious and hurt.

Nick wants to cut Nick's mother out of her life completely but Nick's best friend thinks Nick should give Nick's mother another chance. Nick thinks it’s bad enough that Nick's mother deserts her own children but now that Nick's mother has deserted Nick's son, Nick is done. AITA for Nick wanting to just cut the cord and be done with Nick's mother for good?

Background: Nick has dogs & cats. All of them have been rescued from being strays/abandoned, etc. Nick has also been fostering for 2 years. Obviously, Nick loves animals. Nick is 24 & moved out of his mom’s house 3 years ago when Nick's boyfriend and Nick got a house together because Nick didn’t feel Nick's pets and Nick were safe. Without going into detail, Nick's mother has never been easy to live with but Nick's last 7 years in her house were hell.  
About 7 years ago (Nick was 17), Nick rescued a starving, sick kitten that Nick found in a parking lot across the street from a burning building. He was screaming, and alone, & starved. Nick took him home, fed & took him to the vet. Nick named him Scout. Because Nick had pets already, Nick's younger brother decided Scout would be ""his"" cat. Nick didn’t mind because Nick was still living in the same house.  
A few months before moving out, Nick had worked a 17 hr shift and Nick got home asking about Scout because Nick had not seen him. NOBODY else noticed him missing. Nick's boyfriend and Nick put up posters, walked the neighborhood for hours and put his litter box out. Nick's brother did not help them look. The next night, boyfriend and Nick again searched all day. Around 11pm, they went out to check the litter box again and he had returned!! When Nick moved out, Nick took all the pets except Scout because Nick's brother and mom wouldn’t let Nick. Nick begged them to be careful.  
Well... not even a month after Nick moved out, Nick was told Scout was missing again. ONLY boyfriend and Nick again searched. They did everything they could to find Scout. They kept it up for months but Scout never came home or was found. Over the last few years, Nick has continued to look for him and get email alerts for lost/found pets on Nick's city. Nick checks every one in case it’s him. Nick was devastated and has felt guilty about not bringing him with Nick.  
Yesterday, while checking the animal shelter page, Nick saw a freshly posted cat Nick KNEW was him. By then, the shelter was closed. Nick showed Nick's boyfriend, and he agrees it’s him. Nick texted Nick's brother right away and sent him the picture. He said it looks like Scout. When Nick asked if he wanted to go see him at the shelter, he asked if today. Nick explained it was closed but he could go tomorrow AM since Nick can’t go till after work, around 5PM. All he replied with was ""yea maybe"".  
Nick's boyfriend and Nick decided they will go after work, adopt Scout, bring him home, & not to tell anyone. Would Nick be the asshole if Nick does this?  
  
TL;DR: Cat that Nick rescued as a kitten 7 years ago was deemed Nick's brother’s cat when they all lived together. He was let out to escape from mom & brother’s house a month after Nick moved out(3 years ago). Brother and mom wouldn’t let Nick take him with Nick when Nick moved. They never helped in extensive search for him. Nick has still been on the lookout and found the cat in Nick's local animal shelter page, posted for adoption yesterday.

0,"AITA for Nick cutting ties with her father 10y ago and refusing to resume communication? | (Scroll for tldr)
Nick's entire family (mum, bro, Nick herself) was hostage to her father's moods. He spent his time isolating them, bullying them, gaslighting them, screaming at them for hours until they cried (or threw up in the case of Nick's brother), throwing landline phones or chairs at Nick's mother (but never actually hitting her, which used to make Nick think this wasn't *really* bad), and more, until the divorce.

When Nick hit puberty it became even nastier so Nick refused to see him and he'd call Nick a 100 times a day until hearing the phone ring would make Nick retch, stand in front of Nick's mum's building for hours, scaring the neighbours and occasionally breaking the glass door.
As an adult Nick went to see him twice a year which led to tons of guilt tripping (5 min after getting to his place for xmas: ""so what do you want to eat next year xmas when you come again?""). Nick told him Nick wouldn't take any insult directed at Nick's mother, he'd say ""you know it's not your mum's fault if she is stupid"", which he was really adamant did not qualify as insulting her.

Because Nick is petty as hell, what truly prompted Nick to cut ties was that whenever Nick opposed him, he'd act as if he was proud of Nick for ""standing up for Nick herself"".
Nick realised he was trying to turn this into a ""I made you tough"" narrative and Nick was not having it. Nick ghosted him. He sent Nick 4 letters that all start with ""Well I dont know what I did to you but I'm sorry"". They were promptly binned.

*The twist*: Nick's father has a severe undiagnosed mental illness which contributed to making him this way, notably by ""making him"" an alcoholic, leading to him being unemployed for almost his entire life. Nick has this same mental illness but much less severe, so Nick knows what it's about. Regardless, he still made the choice to torture them, and not by accident: he brought Nick's mum into his country only to forbid her to learn the language. He then was obsessed with only having daughters (because women are weak and easily controllable, amirite), when Nick's brother was born he was so mad he didn't hold him for the first 6months of his existence. Nick's brother took his 1st steps because Nick's father was screaming and he was trying to get away from him.

Whether or not they know this, people who seem to think Nick is in the wrong here insist Nick should forgive her father and resume communication, for... closure?
What Nick's thinking is Nick doesnt need to forgive anyone! Nick moved on and this is not part of Nick's life anymore. Speaking to him means teaching him about how much of an ass he is and trying to make him see the light. Nick feels the efforts would be at 90% coming from Nick and Nick's over this, not a project Nick is interested in. Besides, would it not be better for him to die alone not knowing - he isnt even really alone because Nick's brother is a selfless angel and takes care of him.

TLDR; Nick's father made Nick's childhood a nightmare but partly due to an undiagnosed mental illness.
Also Nick's super petty and Nick knows her decision is somewhat linked to that.

0,"AITA for declining Nick's best friend's wedding invitation? |  

Hi AITA.

tldr; Nick's best friend(28M) and Nick (25F) have been online friends for roughly 5years. Nick would say he's one of her bestest guy friends. Nick has seen him struggle with his relationships, seen him go from job to job and saw him thrive in his current relationship now. Recently he had asked Nick if she would attend his wedding and Nick of course said she was going to decline out of respect for his fiance.

Here's some backstory:

He and Nick met on an online server. They've never actually met in person but they kicked it super well and have continuously stayed friends for 5 years now. When he first met his now fiance, Nick helped him plan his first date and even now every little detail of how he had custom made her wedding ring to where he had asked for her hand in marriage. Nick absolutely adores her, at one point they all were in a group chat together, Nick talked to her privately via text. Nick thought they were all pretty good friends until about a year ago when her bff told her that his fiance was actually pretty uncomfortable with Nick. He said every time he brought Nick up, she would get pretty moody. He would also say that she didn't like that they had so much inside jokes, also how he had a crush on Nick, just the whole idea of them being friends really made her uncomfortable. Nick eventually distanced herself so that they could cool off and he made the effort to tell his fiance that there was nothing more than a solid friendship.

They would text nonchalantly but never to the extent of how their friendship normally was. Recently this year they started talking normally again. Nick misses her best friend but she also told him that she understood boundaries and she never wants to make his fiance feel like she is less than or feel like Nick is competing for his attention, or whatever she may feel. Nick has always tried to accommodate her feelings to make it known that Nick was only his friend and even waved her relationship around saying they should go on double dates if Nick ever decided to meet her bff and her in person to make sure that she knew Nick had her own relationship and never wanted to step in hers.

So a couple days ago, he had told Nick that they had a date for their wedding and asked if she would come. Nick had asked him about how his fiance felt and he stayed silent. Nick took the silence as she didn't really feel comfortable about Nick still, so Nick softly declined out of respect for his fiance because she never wants to make her day be less special because of Nick's presence. It sucks because he is her best friend and Nick would love to be there for him but she knows the circumstances wouldn't be favorable.

Personally, Nick feels like an asshole whether she showed up or not. She knows her best friend doesn't want to have to choose between his life partner and his best woman friend. She wants to be there for him but she also doesn't want to make her uncomfortable on one of her biggest days of her life. If Nick showed up, she is an asshole to her and if she doesn't, she's an asshole to her best friend.",False,False,5,4,4,2,2,4,Care,584
0,"AITA for socially ostracizing his manager and getting her fired? | This one happened ~6 years ago but Nick still thinks about it from time to time.

Nick was hired for his first job (a contract position) at a convention for his hobby. Nick was thrilled to work at a huge-name company with great benefits making cool things, and grateful to this manager for having taken a chance on him. After 6 months Nick was upgraded from contractor to full-time employee and moved from the large team he started at to an intimate team of 6 people, working directly under his manager as the only non-remote employee in their dept.

Their team worked crazy hours, got little sleep, and were threatened with being disbanded for months. They became very close under those adverse circumstances. Eventually they got out of the danger zone and were able to bring more members to the team, which was nice. The dynamic remained close and they continued to put in long hours. One night Nick was there at 2am with his manager, and they were drinking since it was after hours in a very alcohol-friendly company, and she confessed that she really liked him. She asked him to break up with his girlfriend and date her instead, semi-jokingly. Nick laughed it off and said he couldn't do that, but felt disquieted. 

The next day Nick was wary since he had no idea she felt that way up until then, and started to question if maybe he'd been hired for his appearance and not his work (the person he was hired to replace was his boss's ex (he later found out), and VERY similar in looks to him). His manager asked if he was okay and he said yes but decided to be distant, which changed the vibe. She crossed the line in his opinion when she scheduled a 1:1 during work hours to ask if ""they were cool"" and to talk about interpersonal things. After that Nick felt her watching him constantly, she'd leave work the same time to talk to him in the parking lot, and would try to corner him to check in on things when he was by himself... eventually Nick asked a male friend to warn him when she was around because he was so stressed. Their coworkers noticed and Nick didn't want to tell them about everything so he brushed their questions off, but it was obvious he was avoiding her. The exec of the 10 person team also pulled Nick aside and asked if he was being harassed but he said no... this situation was made more complicated by the fact that she was trans, and Nick identified as such as well at the time but did not present. Nick didn't want to seem transphobic OR have to out himself if that came up. Their big boss was a very Baby Boomer kind of guy who made fun of minorities casually and Nick didn't want to disclose info to him in particular, although Nick was sure he would have done something fair about it. Eventually the team began eating and spending time together without her and after 3 months of being shunned, she quit.

0,"AITA for being frustrated that Nick's husband’s father is sick and dying? | A little background, Nick's husband has 5 siblings and grew up in Brazil and Nick grew up in USA. He lived there his whole life and when they got married (5 years ago) Nick moved there to be with him while they applied for his residency in the USA. Their ultimate goal was to move to the USA and find work, start a family, save money. 

About 3 years ago, his 80 year old father started to feel tired. It began with him not moving around as much and asking his family to bring him everything to his room. During this time, Nick also got pregnant and had a baby boy. They raised their son in Brazil for about 2 years until Nick's husband got his green card. Once he got it, they planned to move to the USA within six months. Well, his father’s health kept declining and for the past year they put off their move to take care of him. Nick mentioned her husband's siblings because Nick always felt they didn’t put in as much work as Nick's husband did to take care of their father. Nick's husband was basically his primary care taker. As you can imagine, this is very hard and constant work. His siblings would help out, but most of the responsibility landed on Nick's husband. They found out a few months ago, his father has stage 4 cancer. 

Although this news was heartbreaking, they couldn’t put off their move any longer this year. They had to move to the USA or risk losing the green card and all the money they invested. They made arrangements and Nick's husband's siblings took over the care-taking responsibilities for his father. 

They’ve been in the US for about a month now. Their move was very emotional for Nick's husband's family because they grew accustomed to having them around. Nick's husband is also feeling very guilty about leaving when his father is on his death bed. 

As expected, it’s taken a lot to adjust to life here for all of them. Nick is currently 7 months pregnant and working. Nick's husband is looking for work but hasn’t been successful yet. On top of that, his family sends him messages saying how much they want him to come back and how much they need him. 

He wants to go back for a couple months and Nick can’t help but feel exasperated. Nick loves her husband's family and Nick can understand the absolute stress everyone is under, but Nick feels like their children and Nick are being pushed to the side lines. Also, this complicates his residency application.

Nick has been completely supportive of whatever her husband decides. Nick always tells him Nick totally understands what he’s going through and this is his decision to make. But Nick keeps thinking if he goes back, it will only cause more work and stress for Nick. Nick basically has to work, raise her son and prepare for birth on her own. On top of that, Nick would truly just miss her husband so much if he wasn’t here with her. Thinking about him leaving makes Nick feel so sad and lonely.

0,"WIBTA if Nick reported her friend for animal negligence? | Basically, around 2 years ago Nick's friend moved out of home and bought two kittens. Due to health issues Nick's friend ended up quitting her job and staying at home full time living on welfare (Nick is only mentioning this because Nick believes it is relevant to the problem). This meant Nick's friend spent 24/7 in her 1 bedroom flat with her cats. As they grew out of the tiny kitten stage, she said she wanted more. So she bought 3. Nick was a little worried at first, Nick didn't know whether her friend had considered the commitment of having 5 cats but her friend seemed set on getting them. As Nick's friend doesn't have work to focus on anymore, her cats have become her entire life.

Fast forward by about 9 months on and the same pattern just kept happening again and again, the cats started getting bigger and then she said she wanted more kittens. Nick suggested fostering kittens but her friend said it wouldn't be the same. Now, Nick's friend has 10 cats, all under 3 years old. Ultimately, they were being cared for so Nick stopped getting involved.

That is, until a month ago. Nick hadn't seen her friend in a while as Nick's started a teaching job. Nick thought it'd be a nice surprise to visit her friend but when Nick got to her friend's flat, her friend didn't seem happy to see Nick at all. Her friend's place was a tip. Nick knows her friend suffers from depression so Nick tried to reassure her friend that there was no need to be embarrassed and helped her friend clean. As Nick reached for a box in the corner of the room her friend shouted at Nick not to touch it. Nick looked inside it and saw a bunch of newborn kittens curled up with one of her friend's cats.

Nick's friend explained she hadn't realised she had male cats and assumed they were all female. She'd never taken any of her cats to the vets, so none had been spayed or neutered or received any vaccinations because she ""didn't see the point in wasting money and putting them through invasive surgery"". While Nick was there Nick noticed 3 other cats with protruding stomachs, Nick asked if they're all pregnant and her friend said yes. When Nick asked whether her friend would consider taking them to be spayed (basically, aborting the kittens) her friend said absolutely not and that she'd be keeping any kittens she can't find homes for. Nick can't even do the math on how many cats that would leave her friend with.

So here's Nick's dilemma. Talking to her friend is completely useless at this point. Nick offered to adopt a few of her friend's cats but her friend refused. One of the pregnant cats is only 9 months old, and the others are not much older. Though all of the cats seem happy Nick just feels so bad for them. Nick is meant to be her friend's friend and Nick feels awful for considering this.

Nick would warn her friend first but Nick doesn't think it would achieve anything, Nick thinks if Nick told her friend she'd just freak out and threaten to harm herself, as she has done that kind of thing in the past. But Nick also thinks reporting her friend could mean all of the cats will be taken from her friend and Nick genuinely does not know if her friend would mentally recover from that.

0,"AITA for making his mother cry | So recently for context, Nick had trouble finding work due to his condition (Epilepsy); Nick was unable to do EXTREMELY fast paced work (Fast food, warehouse work, etc). So it was a trying time for him. Nick's mother allowed him to stay with her and her boyfriend just until Nick could get on his feet.

So 3 months into the stay, Nick had 2 jobs, none Nick could keep and had been holding down minimal work doing video editing for people. Nick had been paying her (although not huge amounts).

So 3 days ago, she came home late and drunk with her boyfriend and Nick's 2 other younger siblings in the car. Nick asked how everything went and she told him Nick had until tomorrow afternoon to leave. Nick at first said ""Are you sure, let's talk about it more tomorrow."" And the annoying bf loud mouth got in Nick's face and said ""SHE'S SURE!! WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH YOUR SHIT ANYMORE!""

Next day came and Nick's stuff was outside. Nick tried to talk to her but Nick couldn't say anything without her asking her bf. She had become so dependent on this guy she couldn't even make a decision on a meal, what pill she should take, and how much (and Nick wasn't exaggerating this Nick swore to GOD, Nick swore) how many breaths of air to breathe in a minute.

Nick asked her if she could let him sleep in her car for the night in exchange for $10. She told him ""NO! YOU ARE 19, YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU CAN FIGURE YOUR OWN SHIT OUT!""

So Nick had spent the last day or two looking for homeless shelters in his city, and any resources for homeless people, none for Men. All for women. Nick slept on a park bench last night in the pouring rain. So morning came, Nick knocked on her door and asked to take a shower. She asked her bf On speakerphone if Nick could, and he said ""if it's over 10 minutes, call the police"" So Nick quickly showered and Nick started the dreaded argument with his mother.

So Nick told her this during the argument ""You would really let your own son, freeze out in the cold rather than let me wait just until Nick gets his tax return (already filed) and gets out""

Then she said the words that sent Nick into a rampage ""If you die, that's your fault, I am not going to help you with your problems"" Nick spent the next 20 minutes cussing her out until she broke down crying.

She attempted to call the police on Nick for cussing her out, in her words ""Abusive behavior"" After they found Nick, they brought him back and assessed the situation and told Nick to go so everything could calm down. Nick asked if there were any resources for homeless people and they told him ""No.""

Nick's mother had gone on to lambast him to other family members over social media and had essentially ruined most of Nick's relationships with family under the guided lies and puppetry of her bf. Ever since she had been with this deadbeat loser, she hadn't been much of a mother to Nick or Nick's little brother; she just did what her manipulating, drunk bf said. She listened to his drunk friends who lied about literally everything and had become nothing but a puppet.

0,"Nick wondered if he was the asshole for cutting off an old friend over a cat. Nick posted yesterday about a big blowout he had with this friend, Thyme, over declawing her cat. Nick was mad about her doing that and Thyme was mad about him judging her in front of other friends. Big fight. Thyme ended the friendship. The post here got deleted since the powers that be decided it was a debate post about declawing.

You'd think that makes this moot, but Nick's other friends who have been talking to Thyme suggest that in time she'll cool off and want to be friends again, and that Nick shouldn't make rash decisions like ""well fuck you then if you're going to overreact so much to criticism.""

Here's the thing.

When Thyme was angry, she texted their other friend Avocado saying she couldn't talk to Nick as he is a brick wall and a bully, and she doesn't want to go down the rabbit hole again, so could Avocado let Nick know how she feels?

...They're almost 30.

So Avocado let Nick know, per Thyme's request. Nick texted Thyme to say that if she's really done being friends they should arrange a custody agreement of their other friends so they don't get caught in the middle.

Thyme got pissed and sent them all: ""Custody agreement decided. I'm 100% out."" As in, not being friends with any of them (Nick, Avocado, and their other friend Books).

Avocado was stunned because she'd been letting Thyme vent to her and Thyme just cut her off because she lives with Nick and he has bitch cooties or something.

Hurt, Avocado told Nick, ""Well, if we're going scorched earth, you should know that she had Whiskers put down.""

Whiskers was a 2/yo cat that Thyme adopted. He was healthy but incontinent. Thyme decided she would euthanize. Nick had objected - told her it was shitty of her to put him down when he was otherwise healthy, and that she could rehome him. (Thyme has a barn but Whiskers couldn't be an outside cat because she declawed him, just as she has done to the other >10 cats she has.)

Thyme got sick of it and told Nick she rehomed Whiskers at an apartment complex. Except she didn't. She confided to Avocado last week that she put him down because she ""had no way of knowing if someone else would do something to him"" (hmm, like kill him?)

If it was just that she lied, Nick would let this all blow over provided she stfu about declawing her pets. But Nick didn't feel he could overlook this. Thyme has a history of doing things with pets he doesn't approve of - she once flushed her pet rat down a toilet because it looked sickly. The rat *swam back up.* Turned out it was mostly just dirty.

But to kill a cat because she didn't feel like rehoming it, knowing that it could be alive if she hadn't declawed it, and then go on to declaw more cats? Nick didn't think he could overlook that. It's just cruel.

Thyme, Avocado, Books and Nick have been a very close quartet of friends for about 12 years now. If Thyme decides Nick is forgivable (fucking spare him), and he refuses to be her friend anymore over this, it could cause turbulence with the others and make them feel they have to take sides.

0,"AITA for leaving a dental appointment and leaving a ""mean"" review on every site humanly possible after the way Nick was treated? | This is really hard for Nick to share. Nick has purging disorder. It's like bulimia but no binge. Nick is 25 and started getting help which was hard because everyone associates throwing up with bulimia (or worse ""bulemia"" and ""bullemia"") and gets dismissive. 

Nick has been purge free for the first time since she was 10. Nick hadn't been to a dentist since she was 12. Well obviously, Nick's teeth are fucked. Now when Nick made the appointment Nick was clear that it's been a long time since she'd been to a dentist and Nick has an eating disorder, and asked if she could schedule with a kind dentist because it was already scary for her. They said of course, they understand.

When Nick had the appointment...that's not what happened. The person who started the cleaning and exam was very rough and as soon as she got into it she made this long deep sigh and said ""Let me guess, you're bulimic?""

Nick started to say ""No, I have purging disorder"" and she cut Nick off as soon as Nick said no and said something like ""Please don't lie to me. It's not going to help you or me. We're going to have to (bunch of stuff Nick doesn't remember/understand.""

Nick said ""No, you don't understand. I don't have bulimia, I have--"" she cut Nick off and said ""It doesn't matter. You have severe enamel erosion, several of your teeth have X and Y.""

Nick said ""IT'S PURGING DISORDER"" because Nick thought if Nick said ""no"" again she would catapult Nick. 

She said ""Okay, sure, ""purging disorder"""" with air quotes and rolled her eyes.

Nick isn't proud of it but Nick started to cry because it was already so anxiety-inducing for her. She got annoyed and took off her gloves, threw them away, and said she would be back when Nick calmed down. Instead of calming down, Nick just got her things and left without paying anything. Nick cried in her car but shook it off and ended up going home. 

When Nick got home Nick was still really upset and so Nick started writing reviews left and right about the situation. Nick thinks Nick left one on like 7 sites. About two weeks later, Nick got a call. It was someone from that dental practice who had matched Nick's name with Nick's appointment and wanted to discuss Nick's reviews and how Nick was obviously very upset, but was leaving those reviews really necessary.

Nick said yes, it was, to prevent anyone else from having the same humiliating experience. She argued with Nick that it wasn't going to change anything or fix Nick's teeth. Nick lied and said that Nick had already seen another dentist who had managed to treat Nick with dignity and respect and hung up. On the sites you can reply to reviews, someone responded to Nick and tried to pretend they worked with Nick to figure it out.

Nick has talked about this in her therapy group and with friends. A bunch of people are telling Nick Nick is wrong because 1-star reviews can really hurt small businesses and how it's not their fault they aren't trained better, but Nick shouldn't take it out on them.

0,"WIBTA if Nick (24f) reported her (ex) Therapist for unethical behavior? | Over the past few years, Nick was really struggling with her mental health. Nick was unmotivated, depressed, extremely anxious, and having bursts of anger. 
So a few months ago, Nick decided it was finally time to seek outside help. Which brings Nick to the therapist.

(Nick has since been diagnosed with ADHD and a mood disorder- not by the therapist)

At the end of Nick’s first session with the therapist, Nick was bothered when they forced her to hug them at the end and said “you’ll get used to it”. Nick is not comfortable with physical touch.

Nick kept going to the sessions because 1. Nick wanted to give them a chance and 2. Nick was finally getting help and did not want to deny herself an opportunity to feel better.

So 2 months go by and Nick consistently goes to her weekly session. Eventually Nick’s sessions were only doing the biofeedback, even though Nick wanted and needed talk therapy. 
They also arrived 15 minutes late to a session (without any notification) AND during Nick’s last few sessions, they spent 10-15 minutes of Nick’s time complaining about their own problems.
Nick’s copay was $45 per session, so Nick did not appreciate that. (2months cost Nick $360)

Here’s the present problem:
Nick recently started school, and due to requirements, had to change her session time/day.
The last time Nick saw them (~3 weeks ago) Nick told them Nick would like to change days and they responded along the lines of “ I am sure I have another availability, I’ll get back to you on that”. 
A few days later, Nick texted them to see if they looked at the schedule—- no response

The next week Nick got the confirmation text for the appointment on Tuesday, Nick immediately texted them to remind them Nick couldn’t make it and that Nick would still like to find another session time that works. —— no response.

The same thing happened last week, automated call and Nick’s text response, asking for their available times—- NO RESPONSE

This week Nick got no text reminder, which seems like they removed Nick from their schedule. Nick texted them 1 final time saying Nick wanted to keep seeing them and to please let Nick know what availability they have. —— no freaking response

Nick has still yet to hear from them. 
No discharge summary or reason.
Luckily, Nick has been on some medicine that has really helped her (thanks to an NP, not the therapist). But Nick has to be honest, this hurts. Guess you could say Nick was ghosted by her therapist. 

Nick really doesn’t like the idea of putting someone’s job or livelihood in jeopardy. But Nick also doesn’t want anyone else to experience this, especially if they are emotionally or mentally vulnerable.

Nick also feels like Nick spent almost $400 for mental health services, that did nothing for her. Again, Nick is 24 and in school, so budgeting that money for therapy was difficult, but at the time Nick thought it was a necessary expense. Now Nick needs to find a new provider, which can take months. 

Important notes: 
- Nick works in providing healthcare services (all Nick is comfortable saying), so Nick is familiar with ethic guidelines and appropriate provider-to-client relationships.

0,"AITA for suggesting that Nick's nephew's bad behaviour is mostly due to parenting to Nick's brother? Nick's nephew has always been a bit of a problem child. He has been smoking since he was 9 years old, has been expelled from 3 schools. He pretty much stays home and plays on his phone all day and doesn't go to school anymore. He has also had several run ins with law enforcement for underage driving, drinking, unruly behaviour and so on. He's sixteen years old now and his only friends are other 30 year olds sitting at home and wasting their lives.

Nick and his family recently shifted to their native country, where Nick's nephew lives. His parents, i.e Nick's brother and his wife cannot combat his behaviour at all. Nick's brother left him in Nick's place so that he has no access from his devices and his friends (who are most likely drug users).

It was incredibly difficult to live with this child the first few days. He's obnoxious, rude and destructive. Nick put some rules into place, like do your chores(doing his dishes, making bed and doing laundry once a week). The same rules everyone in the family follows. He didn't like it at all. He bullied Nick's kid, tried to burn a blanket, stole Nick's car keys, broke some stuff. He did all this expecting that Nick would kick him out. But Nick didn't. Whenever he broke a rule, Nick and his family would remove all forms of entertainment and he would get bored and eventually he would do as told. Nick and his family would sit him down and explain that actions have consequences. He also earned an allowance by helping Nick clear the attic(old house) and do some repair work, and compensation would be taken out of that if he broke something. Nick and his family also prohibited smoking, instead Nick gave him nicotine gum at regular intervals to prevent withdrawal.

While he was extremely resistant for a while, he eventually gave in and started doing things without being told. He stayed with Nick and his family for 3 months and there has been a massive change in his attitude. While he is still very rude and obnoxious, he stopped smoking, is not destructive, does his chores and has expressed an interest in going back to school. He also opened up that his father was always busy, and didn't care if he lived or was dead. He told Nick that his mother would cart him around therapist to therapist, and whenever they would express that he has a particular disorder she would change doctors. From what Nick learned, Nick's brother is a workaholic and his mother is heavily into alternative treatments, MLM's, and other things so she's away from home a lot.

When Nick took him back, Nick sat them both down and told them that Nick felt that they both should stay home more and look after their kid. He was very starved for attention and love, and he needed them both. They were extremely offended, and basically banned the kid from talking to Nick. It's been a few weeks and Nick has tried to contact him several times but Nick can't reach him.

Boomer was their dog. They got him as a pup 4 years ago. In the last 3 years, Nick’s mom got lots of phone calls of S calling, screaming that M is horribly abusing Boomer. Pushing him down stairs, throwing his shit at him, and other unspeakable things. He abused the dog horribly because that’s how he thought dogs should be trained. Nick knows, disgusting.

So about a year ago, Nick visited and saw Boomer was obese. So Nick started taking him on hikes. He loved it and bonded to Nick, then started to hate home. S would say things like Nick should have him but M is super attached to him. After a vet visit they said he had Hypothyroidism, causing him to gain weight and needs to be on a pill for the rest of his life. M thought Boomer would never be the same, so he thought about giving him up. It was super hard, as this was his best friend. S was trying hard to get M to give Boomer up, because that’s what would have been best for him. Eventually, after lots of emotions and tears, M decided to give him up. In all the emotion, it was said that there would be no problems letting them take Boomer for a weekend or something. It wasn’t discussed any further then that. Nick had no issues with that at the time, as Boomer wasn’t Nick’s yet.

The first day Nick got him Nick took him to the vet and got the medication he needs. Nick knocked 60lbs off and In that time he grew a super strong bond to Nick and Nick’s boyfriend. They put a lot of work into making him theirs. He’s a different dog.

Yesterday, S texted Nick asking if they could have Boomer for the weekend after all this stuff going on because their boy is really missing him. Nick totally doesn’t feel comfortable with that. Neither does Nick’s bf. Nick doesn’t trust that he’ll be taken care of properly. Nick fears he’ll be mistreated. Also when they visit their house, Boomer gets visually anxious when they leave because he thinks they’re gonna leave him there. Nick totally wouldn’t feel right leaving him. It’s not fair to Boomer. So Nick decided to say “when this is all over Nick’ll come spend the day and they’ll do fun things” she said “that’s fine but I was thinking the weekend so the kids could spend more then a few hours with him” Nick said “Nick means Nick can stick around for a while, it would be fair to Boomer because he’s really attached to Nick. Maybe the kids could sleep over here” she responded with “Was that not what they discussed when S first agreed to give him to Nick that they could still have him for a weekend here and there?”.

TL;DR - Friend smokes in her car all the time, even with her 2 kids (4 & 7) in the vehicle. Cops gives her a ticket for it. Nick backs up the cop. She de-friends Nick on all social media and refuses to talk to Nick and now 2 friends tell Nick she should have just agreed with her to make her happy.

LONG VERSION - She's a smoker and she smokes with her 2 children in her car, in the back seats. She got pulled over by a police officer and got a ticket for smoking while her children were in the vehicle. She was complaining to Nick about it saying she had all her windows down and how she is going to fight it or not even pay it. as well Saying the cop called her all these nasty names and shes also going to file a complaint. Her argument was they have no right to tell her how to raise her children and she's been doing it for years & sees others do it and feels singled out cause she is black & had it been Nick she wouldn't have been given a ticket. (Nick is white)

Nick: Nick couldn't defend her actions and told her that Nick is all for what a person can and can not do with their own body but if it ever endangers another person (of any age) that's a TOTALLY different story. Nick feels she is endangering the life of her children by doing this. Second hand smoke has been proven to be deadly. As far as filing the complaint about the officer, Nick told her if she feels what he said was inappropriate, then to of course file a complaint at the department HQ ask them to review his bodycam, (By her demeanor and the way she's playing herself out to be the victim, Nick honestly doesn't believe the cop called her nasty names BUT Nick never said this because that wouldn't have been productive in the slightest). She called Nick a bad friend for not being there for her and she thought Nick hated cops as much as she did... Nick told her Nick has NEVER said she hates cops. Nick hates BAD cops, and has no problem with the majority of Police Officers. After 45 minutes of Nick trying to explain to her that even though they ARE her children, when she is putting their health in danger by smoking with them in the car, Nick can't back her whole ""Fuck the police"" rant because Nick believes what the officer did was right because by her own volition she admitted to doing it ""ALL THE TIME"".

She is forced to use a wheelchair every day... lets call her Lacy. Nick is a family friend, and not an official caregiver, but he had been taking her out for walks and ice cream on Saturdays while her siblings were at camp on the west coast and her parents worked their business.

She did great, and he rarely needed to help her along the pathways or off the curbs when they were out and about. However, often they would walk through public parks and she was scared of dogs... but was completely fine if they were on a lead and the owners were present to restrain them.

On this Saturday they were lined up outside of a very popular ice cream shop. It was extremely busy and had an outdoor service window so people could order outside instead of going in. They were lined up with a bunch of people who had dogs and Lacy was fine. However, a few minutes later someone lined up behind them, the girl that ended up behind them had a very aggressive terrier. Nick was not at all bothered by dogs, well behaved or not... but he could tell Lacy was getting anxious and her hands were getting sweaty. For some reason the dog was taking a special interest in the wheelchair, and not a pleasant one. He kept barking incessantly at Lacy and grabbed a hold of Nick's jeans with his teeth when he stepped between him and Lacy as a barrier. He was gnawing away at the wheels and Nick would gently brush him off. Lacy was actively trying to move away from the dog, but as she moved up, the girl behind them moved up too, while still paying absolutely zero attention to the dogs behaviour and chatting to her friend.

Eventually Nick tried to get the girls attention, as she was deep in conversation and clearly used to tuning out the barking and growling. Instead of looking at him when he said ""excuse me..."", she just held up a finger, as if to say ""one second"", and then proceeded to keep on talking. It was such a rude gesture that Nick's ears actually burned with fury. He pushed Lacy up a bit further and then the guys in front of them asked them ""is that dog bothering her?"" and just as he was about to answer the terrier jumped up and nipped at Lacys fingers and she screamed. Reflexively Nick swung around and grabbed the dog by its abdomen as it was just about to jump and pushed it away, probably a little more aggressively than he should have (it fell over).... while nearly spluttering

They’re kind of at the age they don’t really party as hard anymore, so they just planned on having a nice dinner and maybe walking past the area they do the fireworks when they are done. There wasn’t a particular restaurant either of them were dying to go to, so Nick left it to him to make reservations somewhere. He asked Nick to dress for fine dining.

Now, through out the holidays Nick’s sister has been very sick in the hospital. She has been battling cancer and it’s metastasized into her brain. It entered into her brain fluid and essentially became something “incurable but treatable.” It has been absolutely **devastating** for Nick’s entire family. Nick has been not going to work as frequently and barely has it in herself to be social with anyone.

Nick spent Christmas Eve, Christmas, and basically almost every day in between in the hospital with her sister. Nick has started to feel bad and apologetic because Nick knows her boyfriend wants to spend this time with her, but to Nick she needs to prioritize her sister.

Yesterday Nick found out Nick’s sister supposedly has “a few days to less than a few weeks to live.” Nick has never been more heartbroken in her entire life. Nick wants to spend all her time with her sister, but Nick also doesn’t want to make her boyfriend feel unimportant or leave him in a situation where he has to be alone on holidays. You may ask why he can’t come to the hospital with Nick, but Nick’s sister specifically requested not to see any non-family members.

The hospital has asked that Nick’s sister always has someone with her, so they arrange their schedules something like this: Nick’s parents stay with her for a long majority of the morning, some relatives/Nick’s other sister and Nick will come in through out the afternoon or when they are off work, and her husband comes at night to stay the night with her.

Today, on New Year’s Eve, Nick’s family would like Nick to go around 5-6. Nick’s boyfriend made a reservation for them at 8:30. Nick wanted to try to do both, but the hospital is an almost an hour away from where they are supposed to be going. Nick doesn’t see how she can make it for the dinner.

Nick feels like she is abandoning her boyfriend on New Year’s Eve. He has no other plans and it’s too late for him to do something else with someone else.

He has never made Nick feel bad about it. He understands that this is Nick’s family and it’s important. But just because he says that, doesn’t mean he isn’t disappointed, and Nick knows *Nick* feels bad.

The pregnancy was unplanned, and very very stressful. Nick had an eating disorder in the past, so getting so much bigger was a huge stress for her. Nick is also only 4'11, and weighed around 95lbs for half of her pregnancy, so it was also very hard on her body. Pregnancy was not really an enjoyable experience for Nick for a bunch of reasons, so she was determined to try and make the birth as smooth as possible. Nick started her birth plan at around 7 months, and was adamant she wanted an epidural.

Nick moved back in with her mom when she was 6 months gone because of the health issues around her pregnancy, as her boyfriend works 8-5 and Nick was on bed rest for a long time. Nick's mom helped with Nick's birth plan, and continuously said that Nick shouldn't have an epidural, that Nick should experience birth, if Nick doesn't have a natural birth with anything but gas and air that Nick isn't a 'real' mother, that young girls always cop out, etc. Nick's mom was also judging Nick for Nick's parenting choices (such as wanting cloth diapers and wanting to try EC). Nick was sick of hearing it and told her mom that Nick would be doing what Nick wanted, and that if her mom was so insistent Nick couldn't have an epidural then her mom couldn't be in the room when Nick gave birth. This conversation happened almost every day, until Nick went into labour at 35 weeks.

Nick had to have an emergency c-section. It was traumatic and painful, and Nick doesn't remember much of her daughter's birth. Nick is having a really hard time coming to terms with this, and Nick really does feel like the universe is telling her she shouldn't be a mother because of the pregnancy issues and the birth.

Nick stuck to her word and Nick's mother wasn't allowed in the room with Nick until the day after the birth. Nick's mom came in upset, and when she held Nick's daughter the first thing she said was 'ah, she's gorgeous. Nick's mom is so glad Nick gets to feel the birth now because Nick didn't get to do it naturally'. Nick's mom gestured to Nick's c-section wound. Nick was furious, demanded her boyfriend take the baby from Nick's mother, and asked her mom to leave. Nick's mom cried and said she was joking, Nick said her mom needs to go and Nick needs time to consider whether Nick wants her mom in her life at the moment considering her mom obviously has no respect for Nick.

Roughly 2 years ago Nick was diagnosed with brain cancer. They also found metastasis from the tumor all the way down his spine. He went through chemotherapy and radiation as a result. One possible side effect of the treatment was that he would become infertile. So he had his sperm frozen before the treatment just to be on the safe side and he really did become infertile.

The problem is that Nick doesn't want to have biological children. He also suffers from major depression and his early 20s were absolutely awful as a result. It took him several years just to become a functioning member of society and he still goes to therapy and takes antidepressants to this day. There's also a history of depression in his family. His mom and his uncle have also been diagnosed with depression and they think that his grandmother also suffered from it.

Because of that Nick decided that he doesn't want to have biological children. He just doesn't want to see his children go through the same problem as he did. He knows that wouldn't necessarily happen, but he doesn't want to take any chances. A large part of his life has been absolutely awful because of depression to the point where he was seriously thinking about taking his own life for many years.

Recently Nick's girlfriend and he have been talking a lot about having children. Nick absolutely loves her and definitely wants to marry her and start a family with her, but he doesn't want to have biological children. He would be okay with either a sperm donor or adoption. She doesn't want either of these options though and definitely wants him to be the biological father of her children.

She says that just because depression has been a problem in his family that that doesn't mean his children will suffer from it, too. And while that is true Nick still doesn't want to take a chance. The thing is she never knew him when his depression was really bad. They've known each other for three years and have been together for two years now.

A few days ago Nick mentioned that he's thinking about getting rid of his frozen sperm. She immediately started crying and begged him to keep it. He 100% made up his mind on this topic though. He's not going to have biological children with anyone. He thinks it's irresponsible and he couldn't live with himself if his children had to go through the same struggles as he did. He just doesn't see any reason why he should keep his sperm. It costs him ~300€ a year to keep it frozen. (It's frozen at - 196° C.)

Nick is 30 years old and has some pretty serious health conditions.
Until April Nick was going to Nick's grandparents house every day from 9am until 7pm to care for them both. In April we moved in with Nick's in laws whilst we waited to find a new home, as they lived further away and Nick doesn’t drive Nick then went 3-4 times a week for at least 3 hours at a time. Nick has been caring for them for years now.

In June Nick's grandfather was diagnosed with cancer and on Thursday we were told it was time for him to go into the hospice, however they had no space.
Nick went on Thursday until 9pm when Nick had to leave to sort Nick's dogs out, Nick then went back Friday afternoon and has been there ever since. Helping care for grandad, cleaning the house ect.
Nick's grandad passed away on Sunday afternoon and Nick's grandmas back pain was suddenly worse so she’s now bed ridden and can’t sit up at all.

Nick's uncle has gone on holiday he left the morning after Nick's grandad passed and Nick's father won’t do any actual care for grandma (cleaning her up, helping her use the bedpan as she can’t get up to the toilet).

Since Sunday Nick has done everything alone, grandma has you up stairs every 5 minutes, she won’t let you stay upstairs but then demands you back to feed her, give her drinks, help her use the bedpan, keep her company, change the sheets ect. Nick has also been doing all the housework and Nick is exhausted.

Nick's uncles wife has arrived and taken over but she lives 5 hours away and can’t stay indefinitely because she has children.

We are currently waiting for the X-ray to verify but the doctor said he thinks it’s a crushed vertebrae and it’s likely to be months before she can sit up.

Nick has been asked to return and stay. But Nick is honestly at Nick's breaking point. Nick is already a carer for Nick's husband who has Aspergers Nick has 5 dogs and is due to move in 2 weeks. As well as Nick's own serious health issues and mental health issues.

Nick and his girlfriend (then fiancée) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago.

Now, Nick's biological mother is a useless drug addict that Nick has never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. She left Nick with his grandma and Nick was raised by her since birth. Nick has always and will always consider his grandma his real “mother” because she raised him and cared for him all his life.

About a year ago, Nick and his uncles had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but they simply didn’t have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer’s help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia.

Fast forward to Nick's wedding, a few days beforehand they got a call from the care home saying grandma’s condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. Nick's uncles and Nick immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side.

She didn’t pass as soon as expected and it extended up until the day of Nick's wedding. Nick called his fiancée multiple times and explained they had to postpone the wedding. Not only was Nick not in the best state of mind (again, she’s Nick's mother to him) but Nick needed to be by her side when she passed. Nick felt sick at the idea of not being there when he could.

Nick's fiancée was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted Nick get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and Nick understands that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in Nick being there since she wouldn’t even know Nick was there due to her dementia.

She ended up passing the night of Nick's wedding. Nick's fiancée didn’t talk to Nick for roughly two weeks before they finally began patching things up. She said Nick was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as Nick's fiancée she should take top priority no matter what. Nick's opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with his grandma when she passed was more important.

0,"WIBTA if Nick called his sister out for being a terrible mom/person? | Some backstory: Nick's sister (31F) had a baby at 19 to try and save a failing relationship. Big shocker, it didn’t work. Baby comes, dad sticks it out for a while then moves back home to Ohio (they're in PA). Sister does the whole single mom thing for a bit, but meets a guy and decides she’d rather go out and party every night with him then spend time home with a kid so she gives full custody of Nick's nephew to his dad around his second birthday. (Luckily dad stepped up and Nick's nephew is a happy healthy adorable 10 year old).

Cut to 2 years ago and Nick's sister announces she’s pregnant. She tells everyone how happy she is and how she can’t wait to be “a real mom” and that this is going to be her “second chance” baby.

The baby is born and for a while she seems to be doing well, she was working hard and focused on raising her son. Now he’s 2, and a bit of a handful (as all toddlers are) and her temper with him has been getting shorter and shorter. She constantly snaps at him or will come home from work and put him right to bed so that she doesn’t have to deal with him. She also has started seeing someone. This guy lives in Pittsburgh (nowhere near where they live) and she has been driving out to see him more and more often. When she goes out there she leaves Nick's nephew at his babysitters for days at a time without telling anyone where he is until after the fact.

Nick thinks it’s incredibly dangerous for her to be leaving him with someone who doesn’t have any of their contact information and no one in Nick's family even knows her name let alone how to get ahold of her in case of an emergency. They’ve all said something to her but of course she just rolls her eyes and ignores everyone.

She just got back from a 4 day trip to Pittsburgh where Nick's nephew spent the whole time at his babysitters (unbeknownst to them- she swore he was with her until she got home an hour ago and admitted he was at the sitters) and then texted Nick and his sister about plans for her birthday next weekend where she intends to send the baby to the sitter for another 3 days.

Nick is not comfortable going out for her bday knowing his nephew is being shipped off so that she can party, and is planning to offer to babysit instead of going out with her, but Nick knows it’ll cause a huge thing because that’s just how she is. But after everything that happened with her first son and now watching all these things unfold with nephew number 2 Nick finds it hard to constantly bite his tongue.

0,"Nick lives in an apartment building with his girlfriend and has a neighbor across the hall that he's friendly with. Nick doesn't really know her that well but they do say hi when they see each other. One thing Nick does know about her is that she has a son (late 40's?) and a granddaughter (14?) who seems very intelligent just based off having small conversations with her when she sees Nick with his dog. The son, however, has given him and his girlfriend weird vibes. Nick has never spoken to the son but did hear him tell his mom to shut the fuck up one time.

Anyways, here's what happened last night. It was around 11 pm and Nick heard a bunch of loud bangs. Like heavy enough that it woke his girlfriend up. No sound came after so Nick chalked it up to someone falling in their apartment. 5 minutes later Nick heard another big bang and a quick scream. Nick went outside in the hallway to listen and heard nothing so Nick walked up to the level above and listened and nothing. All of a sudden some arguing started up from somewhere on Nick's floor so Nick went down to his floor and listened and heard another loud bang and heard his neighbor telling someone to please calm down.
Nick didn't even think and knocked on her door. She answered hiding behind the door and Nick asked if she was ok and she said yes but it seemed odd. All of a sudden the son came running to the door laughing saying everything is ok blah blah but Nick didn't buy it and cut him off without even looking at him and asked her again "" are you sure you're ok?"" And she said yes once again. Now Nick was in just his boxers, he's a big guy (6'3, 240 lbs) and has a lot of tattoos on his arms and torso so he was TRYING to be as intimidating as possible when he looked her in the eyes and said "" if you have any problems, I'm here"" and then Nick went back to his apartment.

So at this point, Nick pretty much assumes this guy has/is abusing his mom or granddaughter.
Fast forward to today and Nick's neighbor knocked on his door to explain that her son and granddaughter were playing fighting etc and the story makes complete sense. Nick apologized for being nosey and she said thank you for being a good neighbor.

So, Nick is a classic worry wart so he's now stressing out because he feels like the biggest piece of shit in the world for just assuming and labeling this guy as an abuser but his neighbor and girlfriend think Nick did the right thing.

Oftentimes when Nick gets home Nick's boyfriend is playing video games. And Nick's boyfriend spends a good portion of the night playing, with a break to eat with Nick, sometimes do the dishes, and maybe some studying. Nick doesn't care that Nick's boyfriend plays video games. And Nick doesn't care how much Nick's boyfriend plays video games.

Nick's problem is that Nick's boyfriend plays multi-player team games with internet friends of Nick's boyfriend. And it gets LOUD.

Nick's boyfriend has noise-cancelling headphones and probably doesn't realize how loud Nick's boyfriend is being, but also doesn't believe Nick when Nick tells Nick's boyfriend Nick's boyfriend is being loud. Nick's boyfriend shouts orders. Nick's boyfriend does voices and characters. Nick's boyfriend gets frustrated and curses and slams Nick's boyfriend's fists down in frustration.

Even worse is bedtime. Nick would need to be asleep by 9:30 to get enough sleep, and it takes Nick an hour to fall asleep. That's not gonna happen. But some nights it would be nice for Nick to go to bed at 9:30. For the first few weeks of Nick's job Nick went to bed at 10:30 and Nick is realizing that's not sustainable for Nick in the long run (since Nick is not really asleep until 11:30 and then Nick only gets max 6 hours of sleep).

So here's the setup, Nick lives out in the sticks. Everyone has a few acres, tons of woods, wildlife galore, the works. Nick's neighbors and Nick all share one long road as a driveway with houses jutting off every quarter mile or so.

One of Nick's neighbors Nick suspects is a poacher. He has deer feeders set up in his woods, salt licks and artificial water holes, all overseen by deer blinds and hunting positions in the trees. And every now and then you hear a gunshot and sometime later a car goes by with a fresh deer or some other animal mounted. And this happens at all times of the year, not just hunting season. And he's really adamant people stay out of his woods.

Now this happened a few days ago. It was a roasting hot 99, with a heat index in the triple digits. Nick's two dogs start barking and are crowded around his front door, looking through the window. So Nick thinks maybe mailman or something. Nick opens the door and Boom! A white rabbit hops in. His dogs immediately start to sniff it, but it completely ignores them, hops right past Nick to a water bowl a few feet away and starts to drink. After its had its fill it plops on the ground, panting, obviously close to overheating. Nick's dogs just lay down right next to it as if he's a long lost litter mate. Nick goes over and Nick notices the rabbit has a tag on his ear that just says ""17"".

Nick suspects this little guy was either bred to be hunted for sport, or is bait for a fox/owl/something that people pay to release and then hunt the predator. And the suspected poacher lives a good 2 miles down the road. Nick suspects this little guy escaped, survived the trek to Nick's house in the scorching heat and chose Nick's house as a safe place.

Nick's neighbor has not put up any missing signs, or called or anything. Nick called his two nearest neighbors(poacher is about 4 houses down) and neither had a missing rabbit, and both agree likely its animal bait.

Nick's dogs love the rabbit, its very friendly and Nick is seriously considering just adopting it. Nick's aunt is a vet, so Nick can have the tag removed and get information on rabbits and just pretend Nick bought him legally. Nick would feel terrible going to check if he is in fact the suspected poacher and returning the poor thing, knowing he'd likely die.

And even before that, he was nice only when he wanted to be. None of his children asides those living with him take anything to do with him. He is an alcoholic, addicted to drugs and was violent towards Nick's mother when they were together.

There were also some other allegations Nick can't say as they weren't proven, and neither Nick or Nick's sisters were old enough to remember anyway.

After Nick's parents split, Nick's father stayed in the house forcing Nick's mother into emergency housing with Nick and Nick's sisters. Nick's mother would pay him to be in their lives be it taking care of them for a weekend or taking them out somewhere. And when he took care of himself he would leave Nick as a 5-7 year old in charge of Nick's 2 younger sisters. Sometimes he would leave them with a babysitter while he went to the pub, and they were frequently left around family for a few hours here and there or just left in the house with a friend they wouldn't know to watch over them.

He would make empty promises and never follow through, he would yell at Nick for things he was told off for when taking care of them and it was overall not a nice environment. He has never paid a penny towards them unless made to by his partner for Christmas gifts.

When Nick was 8 Nick's mother blocked contact with him due to a court ruling he cannot be left alone with them while they are under 16 until he has gone through family therapy with them.

Since Nick was 8 he has made little effort to be in their lives and the only times have been when encouraged to by his partner, which he never went the legal route.

Two weeks before graduating from grad school, Nick found out she was pregnant even though they took every precaution. Nick told her boyfriend. He told Nick he was fine with it. He is about four years older and felt he was ready to have a baby. For about two months, he treated Nick like crap. Despite telling Nick that he wanted to keep the baby, he pressured Nick multiple times to terminate the pregnancy by questioning her parenting skills. He was also growing distant. Nick cried herself to sleep most nights. He eventually gave Nick an ultimatum - either keep the baby and leave him or stay with him but end the pregnancy. Nick decided to go with the former and moved out. After grad school, Nick started working as a Systems engineer so she was able to financially provide for herself. Nick never asked him for a penny.

During the four months they were apart, his brother and best friend would email, text and call Nick to tell her to terminate the pregnancy.

Nick [23M] has something of a hefty backstory. Nick's bio father left his mum while she was pregnant and Nick idek who he is. She remarried when Nick was 3 to his stepfather and had Nick's first sister a year later. Stepfather had always been cold towards Nick, but when his own kid was born, he basically decided he didn't want to raise someone else's child too and Nick got put into care. Nick was in and out of the care system (mostly in it) until he was 15, when he was graciously allowed back into his family home because he was grown up enough now that his stepfather wouldn't have to deal with him.

Now, Nick's time in care was awful. He's sure others have heard the horror stories about what happens to kids in the system sometimes, and that he doesn't need to go into too much detail. Any time Nick saw his mum he would beg her to come home but his stepfather just simply wouldn't allow it. Nick grew a really intense feeling of resentment towards his stepfather, and he still has it because honestly, fuck him for making Nick go through that.

Now the man is sick. It could be terminal, but he's receiving treatment so potentially not. Mum wants Nick to make amends with him, just in case, but Nick has no interest in that.

Mum keeps talking about how difficult it was for him to have a child with a disability, which he does as Nick's second sister has Down's syndrome, but that's also a bs justification because: 1.

Nick wasn’t coping well.

She showed up yesterday coughing, sneezing, and with watery, runny eyes. She was well aware that Nick had been extremely paranoid about germs and transmitting illnesses to the NICU, or, getting sick herself and not being able to see Nick's baby. She didn’t give Nick and Nick's husband any warning she was sick. She said that she started feeling sick a few days before her flight.

The NICU team said that it might be okay if she wore a mask and was extremely careful about sanitizing, but it was still a risk.

When Nick goes back to work after her maternity leave they wouldn’t be able to afford daycare, but Nick makes too much to qualify for any government aid. Because of this situation MIL had offered to watch the baby in their apartment for a small amount of money so they could work and not be in an even worse financial situation. Nick had even turned down a spot on a list at a daycare because they had agreed to have MIL watch their baby in their own apartment.

Now that it’s getting closer for Nick to go back, MIL came back to them and told them she would not watch the baby in their apartment. Instead she wanted to watch the baby in her apartment instead. MIL gave valid reasons as to why she didn’t want to come to theirs anymore to watch her (the distance driving, being away from home all the time, etc) and Nick understands her feelings about it because MIL was doing them a giant favor. It was a lot to ask of someone especially since they would’ve been paying MIL very little.

The issue with this arrangement comes from the fact that MIL lives in a very bad neighborhood. They have had packages stolen from MIL's house, people have broken into their cars and stolen electronics, etc. There have also been complaints about people coming up to MIL's apartment constantly asking them for things as well as when someone has broken in before. It’s a horrible environment. Nick's boyfriend and Nick both pray that MIL would be able to live somewhere safer, but it doesn’t seem like it will happen any time soon.

After some talking, they decided that Nick's boyfriend would be a SAHD instead of having MIL watch the baby in that neighborhood.

Then Tina was born around the time Nick was 10 years old, from then on Nick was basically a live in babysitter for Tina.

Over the years Tina grow to treat Nick like Tina's mother because Nick took care of Tina, made sure Tina was fed, did the grocery shopping and tired to keep the house clean. Rarely Nick would go out with friends, Nick's mom would tell at Nick about: not going out with friends, about going out too much with friends( after yelling at Nick for not going out), that Nick was lazy, that she should send Nick to a girl's home ( this happened whenever Nick disagreed with her or did something like not do the dishes which Nick did almost everyday after cooking dinner), slapping Nick if she didn't like Nick's answer to her question (example: where is the remote? Nick answering: Nick doesn't know), etc.

Now Nick lives with Nick's loving husband and daughter, and has a tentative relationship with Nick's mom because of Tina and Nick's dad.

His girlfriend is getting really upset about this because she says Nick is ‘taking up a lot of time’ on him and that she wants them to eat dinner together at 7pm. Nick told her that was ok and he would push back his FaceTime calls to 4pm when he knows his son is home from school, but his ex wife said that’s not a good idea because his son has online classes (religious school) at that time.

Nick said ok, he will FaceTime him at 8pm everyday instead then. His son said that’s not a good time for him because he likes to go out with his stepdad and view the sunset from the garden. Basically what Nick is saying is, 7pm works best for him and since he’s the child, Nick wants to help him out as much as he can.

Nick asked his girlfriend if it would be ok if they ate dinner at 8 instead. She said no. She didn’t give him a reason. Nick told her she was being unfair to him because he needs to juggle his sons happiness at a vital time and he is trying to make her happy too, and since both of them are working from home at the moment their schedules are all messed up anyway and eating at 8pm isn’t too out of the ordinary for them.

Needless to say his girlfriend said Nick was being selfish and dramatic and that it wouldn’t hurt to tell his son ‘no, 8pm is better for me’ because ‘standing in the garden looking at the sky is a weak excuse’ to not want that time utilised.",False,False,5,4,3,2,1,3,Care,424
0,"AITA for getting Nick's friend suspended? | Background: Nick (14F) is a paraplegic. Nick's 'friend' (16M) was very supportive through the initial injury. They knew each other in middle school and were friends before Nick was injured.

After Nick's injury, the first thing he asked Nick was if Nick wished Nick were dead. Nick honestly doesn't really remember what Nick said, and then after that, he asked a lot of very personal questions about things. About what still works and what doesn't. It felt really weird as Nick was 13 at the time and Nick didn't really want to think about those things with him. He's been a bit odd about everything for the past year and gets really defensive when Nick asks him if he could stop asking such personal questions.

Last week in English Class, they were having a class discussion about euthanasia. He not so subtly implied that people like Nick should be euthanized to save taxpayers money (basically said how disabled people are a waste of resources, it was quite rude) and Nick started getting a bit emotional and had to leave the room to collect herself. Nick's English teacher is actually really nice and asked to speak to Nick after class and asked if Nick was alright and then spoke some words of encouragement. At that point, Nick completely broke down and told her about how Nick's friend had repeatedly made Nick uncomfortable and Nick explained everything.

Yesterday Nick got a text from him saying that what Nick did was 'super not cool' and a few of his friends confronted Nick and asked why Nick got so mad about a joke. Nick never officially reported him or anything but Nick's guessing Nick's English teacher probably talked to administration about everything. He was suspended for two days and he and his friends are all really pissed, and he keeps insisting it's all just a joke.

Honestly, Nick's a bit glad that he got in trouble. It felt like there wasn't much that Nick could really say or do when he asked Nick really weird questions even after Nick asked him to stop, and Nick hopes that this will make him stop doing that sort of stuff. But a bunch of his friends are really mad at Nick.

Nick does get frustrated with them sometimes, because they’re very careless and often leave crumbs everywhere or use her pots and pans (Nick has separate ones to avoid cross contamination). Nick has never asked them to stop eating gluten though. The only thing Nick asks is that they don’t use wheat flour, since it gets EVERYWHERE and can stay in the air for hours and hours after using it, which she can get sick from if she breathes it in (it has happened multiple times before). Of course they don’t really listen though.

Anyway, her dad's birthday was the other day. He asked if Nick could make him a cake, so she did. But, of course, it was gluten free. Nick loves her dad but she isn’t going to make herself sick by baking with wheat flour, it’s not worth it. They can be kind of weird about gluten free stuff, acting like it’s poison or something. Sometimes if they know something is gluten free, they’ll instantly act like they don’t like it, or try it and say that it’s gross. Which is why Nick doesn’t really cook/bake for them anymore. Her dad is the only one who doesn’t act like that, so that’s the only reason Nick even tried making a cake. 

Because of this, Nick didn’t tell her family the cake was gluten free. They all ate it and loved it, didn’t say anything about it being gross. Later that night her mom found the package for the gluten free flour in the garbage. She asked if Nick had used it for the cake and Nick said yes. She immediately told the rest of the family, and they’re all really mad at Nick for “forcing” her diet on them. They said they thought Nick had grown up by now, and wasn’t doing that anymore. Nick finds this very irritating, especially since only her parents ate the cake! Obviously we can’t have a party right now, so this was just something for the three of us.

The mother abandoned him and left him with their other sister whom she was living with at the time. The other sister eventually got fed up with the situation and basically told Nick's wife that either they could take him or she would call CPS and let them handle it. This took place in Arizona which has a notoriously bad foster care system which usually ends up in abuse, so Nick and his wife couldn’t let that happen. They decided to take him for the time being.

Fast forward to now, Nick and his wife are at their wits end. They have 3 children of their own that they are struggling to provide for. They are currently co-living with Nick’s Mom and splitting rent/bills because they are not financially secure. Nick's nephew was also born addicted to methadone and they’ve noticed some potential development issues coming to the surface. He can’t speak very well for his age, he doesn’t understand potty training, is very destructive, whiny and just very difficult in general. Nick has seen his wife break down several times and cry because she just isn’t equipped to deal with it. It’s also taking a toll on Nick's kids who have started to resent Nick's nephew, even though they may be picking that up from Nick and their mother. They love him, they want the best for him, but Nick doesn’t think they can provide it for him. They don’t want to be angry with him or take out their frustrations on him because none of this is his fault, but they can’t do this anymore. They decided that they would look into other options, but there is nobody else in the family that can or will take him. The parents are MIA and the other sister said no because she needs to put her family first, which Nick understands. So this leaves them with the option of getting the state involved and letting him go into the system (in Texas). Just the thought of this made Nick sick to his stomach and Nick didn’t know if he could live with the guilt. But Nick also knew that they couldn’t live like that any longer.

Six years ago Nick finally reached a point where he could try to have a relationship with his older sister (18 months age gap) they are both adults now and hadn't seen each other for five years at that point. Nick agreed to go to a restaurant for a meal with extended family members that his sister would be attending.

When Nick accepted the invitation he reminded everyone that he has a severe allergy to [unusual and possibly identifying food item] and that he could not sit next to anyone eating [food item]. Nick's sister takes a bite of her burger, says ""this has [food item] in it"" then leans across the table and breathes on Nick's face.

Nick walked out, took Benadryl and called his boyfriend to pick him up.

Nick's therapist was stunned into silence when Nick told her.

Nick's family backed him up at the time when Nick said he was done with her.

That event undid a lot of work Nick had done in therapy and cemented her in his psyche as the monster she had always been to him.

Nick is now getting a lot of pressure from his family to give her another chance. Nick has a four year old, she has a three year old and the extended family want to be able to see both of them every holiday without having to arrange two different things.

Nick's mom has dementia. She is completely losing it. Can't complete simple tasks, starting to shit herself, is almost a 10-second-Tom. She has no idea how old Nick is (25F, youngest of 4) or where Nick lives, etc.   
  
In addition to the dementia she has severe scoliosis that has been endangering her organs for the past few years, emphysema while she continues to smoke who knows how many cigarettes a day (often having two lit at once b/c she forgets she's smoking one), and some other health issues.  
  
She lives with Nick's dad about an hour away. Nick's dad still works full time, two days a week from home. She is driving him nuts and he is so stressed out. She constantly accuses him of stealing her stuff (like candles or her slippers) - something that is common with people with dementia. She refuses to sleep or eat a lot of the time, magnifying her symptoms. She forgets when family visit or when Nick's dad takes her out (probably 6 days a week) and then gets mad no one takes her anywhere. Nick is aware it is all part of the dementia, but it makes things so hard.  
  
Nick wants to move out of state and Nick won't do it while she is still alive. Nick is also worried Nick is going to lose Nick's dad before Nick's mom because he is under so much stress. He has high blood pressure and diabetes. The pain Nick, and the rest of Nick's family, have from seeing Nick's mom like this is almost unbearable.

Nick mentioned his wife's drinking 10 years ago to BIL and his wife went ballistic. But since then her drinking just keeps getting worse. In fact, in the past few months she's fallen down (gave herself two black eyes in the process), and been so drunk on two occasions she lost control of bodily functions (once pee one diarrhea) walking down the hall (thankfully they have hardwood floors) to the bathroom, not realizing what she had done and Nick eventually accidentally stepped in them.

Nick's wife was black. Nick is white. She passed away 6 years ago after a drunk driver ran a stoplight.

When Nick and his wife were together, her father cut her out of his life because she married Nick. He called Nick names, but the real problem was the names he called her, incredibly hurtful and demeaning and reduced her to nothing in his mind but a slave master loving traitor.

He made it clear she was no longer his child. When Nick's daughter was born, he sent an angry flurry of Facebook messages to Nick's wife and called Nick's daughter names Nick doesn’t want to repeat and only calmed down after he received an extreme backlash from his community when his posts gained notoriety.

1,"AITA for asking Nick's girlfriend to leave a concert early? | Nick's Background : Nick is a police officer and used to work in a very active jail dealing with junkies. Nick is also very much in love with his girlfriend and has talked about marriage. 

Background of the issue : Nick's girlfriend and her friend (two females) went to a concert which Nick has no issue with. Nick works crazy hours and doesn't get to spend as much time with his friends/family,  so Nick is perfectly ok with his girlfriend hanging out with her friends. 


The problem: A few days before the concert Nick's girlfriend told Nick that her friend would be the designated driver. One of the first posts to her Snapchat was them both with large mixed drinks. This is where Nick starts worrying. Nick's girlfriend says that there is hardly any alcohol in the drinks, that they are over priced, and that her and her friend would be leaving soon. This was around 7pm. Around 8:30-9:00pm she is still posting snapchats about the concert so Nick asks about it and she says that another performance came on. Then she tells Nick there is cocaine at the concert. Now Nick is at maximum worry, as the experience from the job tells Nick where this cocaine there normally follows other drugs. Not to mention having fought with junkies, Nick knows Nick personally would not like to be in a situation where people are snorting coke around Nick as it can be very dangerous. Nick is also aware that there is only two of them and worried as Nick's girlfriend told Nick she had been roofied a few years ago. Nick asks her to leave the concert for her safety. She then tells Nick if Nick wants her to hide in the bathroom so she can miss the show. Nick tells her that Nick doesn't want her to separate from her friend and that Nick is very much worried for both of them.  She then calls Nick and says that Nick needs to chill out, and Nick is over reacting. At this point she had been rude with Nick and Nick told her she was being disrespectful.  Nick never called her any names and was trying to tell that Nick trusted her, but it was the other people using drugs/selling drugs that Nick was worried about. She ended up staying the full time, then called Nick. She called Nick a dick for asking her to leave and ruining her night. Nick explained to her that Nick was on duty and needed to focus and would like to talk to her about the issue at a better time but she kept trying to push the issue. Nick just asked her to let Nick know when she got home safely and she has now ignored Nick. The time is now 3:30am where Nick is and Nick has not heard from her since she left.  Nick is still extremely worried about her as Nick has no idea she made it home.  She also stated that she wouldn't tell Nick about it next time and that had she not told Nick about the drugs she would have had a great night. Nick is not sure if her silence is her being vindictive... 


TLDR: Nick's girlfriend went to concert, said she would leave at 7, stayed till 9ish, said there was cocaine, Nick asked her to leave because of the danger, she stayed till the end, then tried to start an argument while Nick was at work, Nick asked to table it till a better time, she didn't want to, Nick asked to let Nick know when she got home, no reply back.

Nick's daughter is 16 and Nick is 31. Nick's big sister has always been helpful with Nick's daughter. They are very close. She doesn’t have or want children of her own.

Nick fell on hard times when Nick's daughter was around 12. Nick was essentially homeless after losing a job and breaking up with Nick's boyfriend. She went to stay with Nick's sister as Nick figured out what Nick was going to do. She stayed with her for a year or so. When she came back to Nick, she began having behavior problems. She felt more comfortable talking things out with Nick's sister so Nick let her.

This Wednesday the hospital called Nick and said that Nick's daughter was in the ER. Some “friends” of Nick's daughters had dropped her off, high, in Nick's sisters front yard. She was unresponsive, so sister called an ambulance. Nick's sister called Nick and filled Nick in. Nick didn’t even know that Nick's daughter was using drugs.

Nick talked with Nick's sister as soon as Nick got to the hospital, and asked her what happened. She told Nick that she knew about Nick's daughter experimenting with drugs, but she didn’t think that it was this serious. Nick is taken aback by this, she knew that Nick's daughter was using drugs but didn’t tell Nick.

When Nick asked her why, she told Nick that she didn’t want to lose Nick's daughters trust, and that she was handling the situation. Obviously not, if shes in the hospital. She apologized and told Nick that she didn’t think it was serious. Nick didn’t care. Nick has the right to know what is going on with Nick's daughter. Nick is her mother, she is not.
They ended up getting into an argument, and Nick told her that she had to leave.

Nick took Nick's daughters cellphone and laptop, upon her returning home so that Nick could go through them. Nick noticed that Nick's sister was trying to contact Nick's daughter. Nick called her from Nick's daughter’s phone and told her that she is no longer allowed to contact them. Nick doesn’t trust her at all. She argued with Nick about it and made the situation worse by calling Nick a bad mother and trying to tell Nick that Nick doesn’t know what is right for Nick's child. Nick told her that she’s the reason Nick's child is using drugs and she’s not allowed to speak to her, and Nick doesn’t want to speak to her either. Nick blocked her number from Nick's daughters phone.

She called Nick's parents, and they are trying to get Nick to allow them to have communication. They think that Nick is being selfish and reactionary.

They are threatening to stop helping Nick with the bills if Nick doesn’t allow them to talk to each other. Nick told them that if they end up homeless it would be their faults.

1,"AITA for telling Nick's SIL that she can't say her stillborn baby matters less than her living children? | As background: Nick's SIL had 3 living children before her stillbirth, and then gave birth to another living child 2 years later. Her 4 Earth-side children have fairly common names, like Emma, Lauren, Sophie, and Andrew. Her stillborn daughter has a more unorthodox name, something like Soulstyce. Nick has one son born sleeping and had several miscarriages. Nick has no living children, but Nick is a mom to a little boy up in Heaven.

Anyways, at Christmas, many of their family members got to meet their new baby for the first time. The subject of how his name was chosen came up, which lead to Nick's grandmother asking why their stillborn daughter had such an ""unusual"" name compared to their living children.

Nick's SIL explained that they gave their daughter a ""guilty pleasure"" name because it mattered less. She said she wouldn't put her living children through the experience of having such an uncommon name, but that it didn't matter when it came to their daughter because she didn't have a life to live with her name. She even joked that she spent a quarter of the time picking out their daughter's name that they did choosing their other children's names because ""it just didn't matter"" and they ""could do whatever.""

It hurt Nick to hear her say that. Nick has spent six years feeling like Nick has no right to call herself a mother and feeling excluded from the ""mom's club"" because Nick's son died from circumstances beyond Nick's control before Nick even got to hold him. To have Nick's SIL, who Nick has supported through each and every one of her pregnancies, who Nick held and comforted through her stillbirth, say that her child *didn't matter* because she wasn't alive - that hurt. It felt very intensely personal to Nick. Nick was right across from her at the table and she said it with no remorse. Nick doesn't care if it took her 5 minutes or 5 days to choose a name for her child, Nick cares that she said it didn't matter.

Nick hasn't said a word about it since then. But Nick lost her job, Nick has had too much time to think, and Nick keeps replaying the whole thing over in Nick's mind. Nick has been stewing about it, Nick keeps drawing away from her and Nick feels guilty. So, Nick called her and told her that Nick had been really hurt by what she said. She was very callous, immediately, telling Nick to get over herself and not tell her how to live her life. Nick got very upset and told her she couldn't talk about her daughter like she mattered less and she just outright said, ""She does matter less."" Nick just started to cry. Nick hung up and Nick's husband consoled Nick for a while, but Nick's brother called Nick to chew Nick out, saying Nick had made his wife upset and she was already busy with their children and she didn't need to babysit Nick as well. Nick has gotten texts and calls from half the family, most of them blaming Nick for not moving past Nick's son's death. Nick's own mother told Nick it was time to start pursuing new family planning options and that Nick was taking Nick's distress at Nick's loss out on Nick's SIL.

Sometimes it's for a couple of days, sometimes it's more than a week, with varying frequency: she might do nothing in two months, and then have 3 gigs in a row.

She loves this job. She has free reign, and it was tailored for her. She even helped designing the kitchen. At first it was only her but now she has an assistant she's become pretty closed to. She has made friends among the organization as well. It also came at a time when they had money issues so they were grateful for it.

There is, however, a series of problems. First of all, her place of work is very far away so she has to stay there for the duration of each job. Which wouldn't be an issue if not for the fact she doesn't have a regular place to stay. Sometimes there's a room available in that place but if not she has to crash somewhere, suitcase in toll. Which could be fixed if not because it's not a well-paid job so they can't afford her own place there.

There are two much bigger issues, though. One, his SO has a physical condition that makes her tired most of the time. She still can work but so much moving around is pushing it. Each time she comes back from a job she stays longer in bed, and she's close to maxxing her meds. And two, this job is straining their relationship. As Nick said they are together because they want to be together, and yet this thing is keeping them apart sometimes for almost full months at a time. Nick not only never wanted a long-distance relationship but also living alone makes him anxious and ultimately affects his health, all of which she knows.

She was in her pre-teens when Nick met her and now she’s 16. Nick loves everything about her and doing everything with her, even when it’s hard and they disagree on certain things.

Nick worried so much about not being able to love her like “her own” despite not having any bio kids (and not wanting any), but whenever Nick goes to her soccer games or dance concerts Nick feels that she feels the same pride that the other parents in the crowd/on the bleachers feel. Nick loves being able to snuggle with her and talk to her about her day on weekends (since her dad/Nick's husband isn’t a morning person at all haha), and Nick loves that she can be there for her when she needs her, especially now that school is out for Nick and her (Nick is a teacher).

Nick honestly hopes she feels the same way about Nick.

However, her biological mom has come back into the picture recently. She got addicted to drugs after extensive surgery for health problems when Nick's daughter was 3 but has told Nick's husband and Nick that she’s getting into rehab to get better and wants to see her kid again whenever it's a better time to do so, given her condition and what they have going on now.

But honestly, Nick has been telling her husband she doesn’t want their kid to see her bio mom, and cited incidents from earlier years where the BM would get sober, reach out, and do 1-2 nice outings with their daughter before spiraling back into drugs again, hurting her in the process.

Granted, it’s been 3-4 years since she did that, and her bio mom does seem like she has changed for the better (has a job again that pays pretty well, is going back to school for a masters, etc.)

However, the real reason, which Nick has told no one, except for her husband, subtly, is that Nick feels concerned that her stepdaughter won’t love Nick as much after she reunites with her bio mom though Nick has said she’d support her regardless of what happens. Even if it hurts.

Everyone says that the biological connection is super unique and powerful and Nick is worried that she’ll lose her when her BM comes back into her life, assuming that her BM has changed and wants to love and care for her. Nick gets that she is not her mom, but Nick has cared for and loved her through the pre-teen and teen years. Nick is going to feel devastated if she loses her.

It started a few months ago when Nick noticed Kylie would eat less at diner, Nick began to get worried when she was completely skipping diner, always making excuses like “I feel sick” or “I don’t like it”, eventually Nick would sit her down so she wasn’t allowed to leave until she finished everything on her plate. Surprisingly she obliged easily and this was the routine for a couple weeks. Nick thought her phase was over as she would eat everything without a hassle.

One day Amber told Nick that Kylie hasn’t been eating at school and throwing up after diner. Nick was VERY worried of course and immediately got a therapist and a doctors appointment to check her health. 

The doctor said that she had lost a bit of weight but it wasn’t threatening at the moment but she would need it managed and check regularly. She had a therapist appointment 2-3 times a week. Not much came of it and after about a month she was thinner and weaker. It was horrible, Nick just wanted to help her. 

She fainted at cheer practice and hurt her hip and this was Nick's breaking point, Nick had to do something.

Every morning she would make a smoothie, like with stuff like berries and vegetables in an attempted to be ‘healthy’ So Nick decided to order 5 kg of weight gain formula that’s used for muscle growth. Every morning Nick would make her these ‘healthy smoothies’, and she never questioned it. 

The doctor was pleased by her weight gain, Nick had told him about the formula he said it was fine as it was helping and keeping her from a risk bmi. Everything was going great. Thankfully she was making process with the therapist and each day she was improving more, during this time she was rarely able to do cheer which motivated her get healthy.

One morning Nick was careless and left the bag on the bench before rushing to work, Nick thought it would be fine as Kylie rarely ever goes in the kitchen and she had to leave to go to school so anyways. Nick was wrong and she found the bag. 

She refused to talk to Nick for two days, and Nick was scared she would get sick again. Her therapist asked to speak to Nick after their session and she practically told Nick Nick was a asshole, not in those words obviously. That Nick had betrayed her trust and set back months of process because of Nick's actions.

1,"AITA for getting upset about someone driving drunk 7 years ago | TL;DR basically the title but Nick will give a brief transcript of the conversation.

**Friend:** *(normal cheerful drunk person tone of voice)* I’ve driven while extremely drunk before! Only once though!

**Nick:** *(serious/angry tone of voice)* That’s really fucked up.

**Friend:** I only did it because [acquaintance who has a reputation for driving while blackout drunk] was going to drive home so I had to drive him instead!

**Nick:** yeah that doesn’t make it okay, you could’ve called a cab.

**Friend:** Man fuck off, it was seven years ago, are you fucking judging me for something I did almost a decade ago?! People change, you asshole!

*(end conversation, he isn’t on speaking terms with Nick now)*

So, AITA? Nick personally feels like he isn’t wrong to be disgusted by that behaviour, because he has done a lot of drinking, and drugs, etc, and he has never even *considered* driving while even *slightly* drunk or high.

Nick doesn’t think “I was young I’m a different person now” or “I was drunk and didn’t make good decisions” are good excuses, because he has been a young alcoholic party animal too and he NEVER would’ve considered driving drunk, even when he was too fucked up to remember his own name he could still remember “don’t drive, someone could die”.

Nick has to be brutally honest and say that, deep down, he is worried that anyone who would choose to drive while hammered just secretly doesn’t give a shit about other people and the fact that they might die. Anyone who would cheerfully bring up, and make excuses for, driving drunk in the past is probably still an asshole too, since they obviously don’t feel ashamed of doing it, right?

On the other hand, Nick’s friends who are still talking to him think he is a completely judgmental asshole. Apparently almost every single one of them was a wild teenager who drove drunk because they’re young and dumb, and it’s something all teenagers on the planet(except Nick) did at one point, and judging someone for a drunken mistake 7 years ago is a total asshole move (even if it was a mistake that could’ve killed someone) because everyone changes so much from age 21-28 that it’s actually an asshole move to assume that they’re still the same person they were back then.

So reddit, you be the judge. Also, necessary background info: though they do live in a small city with cabs and buses, it is a very redneck area where drunk driving is extremely common, so Nick’s friends are probably telling the truth when they say they’ve all driven drunk before... it’s culturally socially acceptable there (unfortunately).

Nick read over the replies to the post and thought really hard about it, although Nick admitted Nick was often argumentative and didn't really want to listen for the most part.

Meanwhile, Nick's fiance's daughter came home shortly after Nick wrote the post. Nick asked her what she thought of her dad and Nick getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with Nick and all.

Nick opened up and became super honest about Nick's anxieties going into the marriage--how Nick didn't know how Nick's role would change in her/their family and how Nick was scared Nick wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.

She reassured Nick that Nick's role wouldn't change much and that ""Nick was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had."" Nick kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.

Since her birthday is coming up soon (Nick always gets her a card and writes her something meaningful), Nick's also started to reflect upon all the memories they've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with Nick, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc.

Now that Nick's more clear on what she wants/expects from Nick after her dad and Nick get married, Nick thinks Nick's come to realize that yes, at first, Nick did sort of have to ""force Nick"" to bond with her, especially when their relationship was on the rocks.

But Nick's really come to love and appreciate Nick's boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors. Without her, Nick wouldn't get nearly as many hugs or as much love, and more importantly, Nick'd have missed out on getting really close with someone as intelligent, talented, and passionate as she is.

When she was away for the past month or so at school/traveling for the summer, Nick actually *really* missed her and knows that Nick's life wouldn't be the same without her. Nick missed her hugs, love and her snarky commentary on their favorite shows. Nick loves all the hugs/appreciation Nick's gotten from her, but she's enriched Nick's life in so many ways.

So no, Reddit, Nick's boyfriend and Nick are not getting divorced or breaking off the engagement anytime soon. But thank you for making Nick really reflect on Nick's thoughts/potential behaviors towards her.

So here’s the thing, Nick and her husband are going on a trip together soon. It’s actually the very first trip they take together. He has a hard, manual labor job and very rarely has time off. And when he does it never matches Nick’s, because Nick has a regular 9-5 job.

Nick and her husband are both very excited about their first vacation together, since they didn’t even get to have a honeymoon. Thing is, Nick’s husband is insisting in contributing equally to the cost of the trip.

He comes from a very poor background and is used to pretty much nothing and having to work his ass off his whole life for what he has.
Nick admires this very very much, but they don’t live in those conditions anymore. Nick has a great job and Nick makes really good money, so Nick is comfortable paying for a large percentage of the trip.

For a bit of context on the trip: they live in Europe and they are planning on going to a small, European capital. The places Nick’s looking to book are not ridiculously expensive, just regular b&b’s somewhere in the city, with little to nothing included. Something simple because they don’t really need much.

On Nick’s husband’s budget, best they could afford would be something like a hostel with shared rooms and bathrooms. Which is not a bad place, but for a first husband and wife vacation Nick thinks Nick’d like a bit of privacy with him...

Nick was thinking in telling him that Nick got a really good “advance purchase” deal and say that the price was much cheaper than what Nick is actually paying for.

Nick doesn’t want her husband to feel bad about himself on something has little as money, Nick understands why he feels like this and that’s why Nick doesn’t want to insist in paying and make him feel like “he is living off of her” (his words). He contributes so much to the household and works so hard, Nick couldn’t care less about who makes more or less money because Nick knows they are both very invested in each other.

Also, it’s not like Nick’s putting them in debt or asking for loans. Nick has more than enough to afford this on Nick’s savings account.

Nick works from home and she owns a business- Nick is completely able to take care of the animals she adopts by herself. Nick's boyfriend and Nick started dating 4 years ago and moved in together 2 years ago. Nick has always been wealthy, but very good with her money. When they started dating Nick made sure to let him know she has no self-control when it comes to animals in need and she would adopt any and all animals that needed Nick.

He lives with Nick rent-free. He's currently in university studying full time. He does have a job but all expenses go towards paying off his university debt. Nick pays a maid to come in and clean once a week. The house is completely clean all the time; the animals inside the main house do not make a mess. They have a granny flat outside that Nick uses to keep the rest of her animals.

Recently they had a massive fight because Nick brought home a new pet. This would be rescue number 23. Nick got her from an online listing. She's an incredibly underweight female rat (about half the weight she should be) as well as a URI. She's been checked out by Nick's vet and Nick's vet is confident she'll be completely fine. Nick's boyfriend got so angry at Nick and said he's sick of all these animals and if Nick didn't stop rescuing them he'd leave Nick.

Nick told him he was being unreasonable since it's her house and he doesn't see the animals all that often. He responded saying he hates rodents and he hates that Nick walks around with them on her shoulder constantly (along with handling other animals). He told Nick it's not fair to him to not tell him Nick got a new pet until after Nick got it and Nick told him it's none of his business what Nick does in her house. Nick told him to get the fuck out of her house until he learned some damn respect. Nick has done nothing but support him, but Nick absolutely will not budge about literally saving the lives of animals in distress.

She's struggled with depression all her life and at this point in time it's gotten near impossible to function. Nick has been helping her out immensely-she moved back in, Nick pays for her living, and she's working on taking care of herself and working to a place where she can handle things like other people and a job again, while getting on medication for her depression. It's going well, she's working hard to get more stable, and it feels like starting over again as a mother-Nick has always loved the baby stage best.

Since this Nick's biological daughter has become bitchy and unpleasant. When Nick asked what was wrong, she told Nick she thought it was ""fucked up"" that Nick opted out of parenting both Nick's children, sort of blaming Nick for their mental health, and then Nick plays mother of the year for a baby that isn't Nick's. Nick let it go because to an extent Nick sees her point. Nick was a young, single, working mother, so Nick didn't spend much time with either of Nick's children. Nick wasn't the most mature or best equipped to handle them like Nick is now. Nick figured she would get over it if Nick let her vent.

She didn't get any happier or nicer, so Nick asked again. And again. And she kept complaining about her *terrible* childhood and how awful Nick was. Eventually Nick got sick of it and told her the reality-she was a problem child and Nick was in over Nick's head trying to do Nick's best. Nick had to handle her underage drinking, drug use, frequent arrests, and an expulsion and she never made it easy. She said that she hoped her sister got her act together before Nick's grandchild gets old enough that Nick loses interest. That was Nick's last straw and Nick told her to stop talking to Nick until she can be respectful and polite.

Nick's husband (her step-father) has refused to take Nick's side, going so far as to say Nick is being disrespectful and Nick has to acknowledge Nick was a bad mom once.

She lives in another state so Nick hasn't seen her in person for a couple years to be sure, but Nick sees her in video chat and pictures at least once a month, and every time she seems heavier. Nick doesn't know her weight or bmi, and Nick doesn't know if she knows either. Nick also wouldn't ask for this information. From looks alone (which can obviously be heavily skewed, especially when you can't see them in person) Nick thinks she's at least obese at this point, and still seems to be gaining.

Nick is starting to really worry about her physical and mental health. A few years ago she complained about (undiagnosed) binge eating disorder, and Nick isn't sure if that's still a concern or what her eating habits are like. To Nick's knowledge she hasn't had any health problems at all, but particularly not any due to her weight. Still, Nick worries there may be undetected health problems or that some may pop up if she continues to gain.

Nick has other reasons why Nick thinks Nick should probably keep Nick's mouth shut, besides there being no known health concerns. 1, to Nick's knowledge her weight is never discussed unless it's insults from her thin sister. Nick doesn't want to create any more insecurities or comparisons there. 2, Nick has had Nick's own history with eating disorders (Anorexia with some binge/purge) and the last she saw Nick in person Nick was very underweight (now Nick is a healthy bmi and in treatment, doing much better) so Nick worries that either she'll see how unhealthy Nick was and think Nick is just a hypocrite or projecting Nick's weight fears on to her or that Nick may ACTUALLY be projecting Nick's weight fears on to her, or at least overly concerned due to Nick's past.

Nick doesn't think Nick is exaggerating her size when Nick sees her, and Nick thinks Nick's concerns may be valid, but Nick isn't sure if it's Nick's place to voice these concerns or if it's ever helpful to discuss someone's weight. Nick has considered talking to her mom instead of going directly to her, but then Nick feels like Nick would just be talking shit behind her back.

She visited on Sunday and when she left, she stayed outside. Her friend let the cat outside and Nick took it. She brought it home and pretended she adopted it from a local shelter. Nick's parents and Nick named it and they have had him until now. They made sure he was healthy, fed him his proper diet and played with him.

Nick would return him if she was voted an a\*\*hole.

Nick is expecting a child with his partner in 7 months.  
He lives literally 1 minute away from his ex and children, he sees them all the time, he has them every other week, walks them to school and they have family meals every Friday.  
Recently he got offered a better job, it pays almost double what he earns currently.  
If he wants this job he would have to move 15 hours away meaning seeing the children will be a tad more complicated than just popping up the street.  
The issue is he has told his ex, he would be willing to drive 15 hours there to pick the children up for half terms, he can go there Friday and stay for Saturday too.  
She thinks he would be an asshole since he makes a comfortable living right now.  
He does not need the money at all, he just wants to have savings there for the children.  
She claims moving away from the children without need would be an asshole move especially with a baby on the way it will look like he is moving away to be away from them with his new family.  
They won't understand why they went from seeing him every day to only seeing him on holidays and Saturdays.

But the morning of his fiancée got a call from work and some stuff had gone wrong and she was going to have a bunch of work when she got back.

Now this ordinarily wouldn’t be that big deal for her but it came with a bunch of other stuff she’s going through and the point is she had a panic attack about half an hour before they had to leave. Full on break down, not just a little worried. She was completely non functional.

After an hour she was a bit better and she told Nick he should go to the wedding because he wouldn’t be too late(probably 10-15 minutes). But she never prioritizes herself and Nick couldn’t just leave her in the hotel alone.

So Nick called his sister, who didn’t answer so he left a message explaining. They caught an early flight home that day.

After they landed there was a very angry voicemail from his sister and mother, and a bunch of angry texts. Over the past week Nick has tried to apologize and explain but they won’t have it.

Kristen decided she was tired of it and went on an extreme diet to take the weight off. Kristen went on a <1000 calorie a day diet, with frequent juice cleanses and fasting days. Kristen lost 60 pounds in 3 months. Kristen has since changed her entire lifestyle to be healthier and so far has not gained back a single pound in the last 2 months.

Naturally, Kristen is getting praised by everyone in her life. Kristen's family, other friends, and even Kristen's doctor are praising Kristen for this weight loss. Kristen didn't eat healthy, or get fit. Kristen starved until Kristen was a socially acceptable size. Kristen honestly had/has an eating disorder, and all anyone can do is praise Kristen and ask Kristen advice on ""willpower"".

About 3 years ago, Nick's mom decided to quit smoking, mostly due to Nick and wanting to live healthy. For the first couple months she really struggled, sometimes sneaking a smoke. She was then reliant on nicotine gum for the first year, then quit completely. Nick was so proud of her and happy.

Today however, Nick caught her smoking a cigarette. Nick was super upset, and confronted her. Nick had a bit of a meltdown and cried. She obviously felt bad, but wasn’t really doing anything or promising not to smoke. So, in order to keep her from smoking, Nick decided to sort of up his game. Nick will not make eye contact with her and is guilting her as much as Nick can. Nick is manipulating her to the point where she almost didn’t go out for the day.

Nick kind of feels like this is some sort of manipulation. Also, just so it’s clear, Nick really is upset and really does want her to stop smoking. She has offered to do things for Nick, and Nick has denied it.

That's where Nick is at right now.

Nick could go on dramatically and bore everyone so Nick will try and keep this simple. Three years ago Nick broke up with a guy who literally checked every box Nick has because he was in the Navy and moving and Nick felt like Nick owed to herself to finish grad school. Nick decided that if Nick kept in touch with him in any way Nick would drop everything and willingly become a happy housewife so Nick changed her number, deleted all social media and got on with the business of getting over him. Call him Charlie.

Fast forward to last week, Nick works in a large office complex and evert single day this very sweet, cute guy walks past Nick's front door and they wave. They've chatted a few times so Nick knows his name. On Wednesday he very nervously asked Nick out and he was just so nice and earnest and sweetly awkard that Nick said yes.

They went out last night and Nick was having a nice time but was like MAYBE there's possibility here but Nick liked him as a person. Nick went to the bathroom and ran smack into Charlie's parents. They always loved Nick and when they said that Charlie had just moved back into town for his next assignment, Nick's knee's literally got weak. Charlie's mom asked for Nick's number and without even thinking Nick gave it to her. Nick said goodbye and rejoined Nick's date.

It wasn't even 15 minutes and Charlie texted Nick ""is this really you?"" Nick texted back ""yes"" and then Charlie asked where Nick was. Nick told Charlie Nick was at a restaurant and Charlie asked if Charlie could come pick Nick up. Again without even thinking Nick said yes. Nick told Nick's date that Nick was having a family emergency and that was the reason for the texts. Nick's date offered to give Nick a ride home. Nick told Nick's date that it was ok and Nick's brother was coming to pick Nick up. Nick said Nick was so sorry and Nick paid for their entire meal but Nick's date insisted on waiting with Nick out front. When Charlie pulled up and it was the first time Nick had seen Charlie in 3 years Nick again got weak in the knees. Nick told Nick's date that Charlie was Nick's brother but Nick could absolutely tell by the look in Nick's date's eyes he knew Nick was lying but he was way too nice of a guy to call Nick out on Nick's bullshit.

Of course it was instant chemistry with Charlie and after playing an hour of catch up they were back at Nick's house doing what they did best. Only Charlie is such an amazing such an amazing guy Charlie said Charlie wanted to slow down a bit and not take it all the way, instead Charlie tucked Nick in and left with a kiss on the forehead. Charlie is on his way over now to take Nick to a champagne brunch. Nick is ready to drive to vegas and get married and never say goodbye to Charlie again.

But enough of the school girl gushing and back to the problem. Nick feels AWFUL for what Nick did to Nick's date last night. Nick doesn't know what to do or say to him and Nick knows Nick is going to see him tomorrow. Nick guesses to help Nick know how to plan for tomorrow, Nick guesses finding out if Nick is a light asshole, a major asshole or even some small chance NTA would be very helpful.

1,"AITA For wanting Nick's boyfriend's 6yo daughter to start sleeping in her own bed? | TLDR at the bottom. Here is some context:

Nick (25f) is in a wonderful relationship with Nick's long time friend & ex coworker (41m) & he has 2 children. 1 boy, age 11 & 1 girl, age 6 (almost 7 in July). Nick loves these kids to death they are both wonderful & well behaved. Nick's boyfriend is a single dad & has full custody of the son, & 50% custody of his daughter. Nick absolutely enjoys spending time with his kids & they had a lot of fun together this weekend. They draw Nick cute pictures & stuff & she gives Nick jewelry to wear so Nick knows that his kids like Nick too.

When they first got together Nick made it clear that sharing a bed with the kids is a boundary of Nick's. It caused his last marriage to have a dead bedroom issue & ultimately ended it, & Nick does not want that same situation for them. So whenever Nick & the daughter are there at the same time, before bed Nick clarifies with boyfriend that ""she will be sleeping in her own bed tonight, right?"" (which is literally right next door to his bedroom) He says yes & puts her to bed. He really is good with his kids & Nick thinks it is sweet. But by 2am she will wake up scared & comes into their room to wake dad up. He gets up & goes to sleep with her in her bed to help her get back to sleep. But when he does that he ends up sleeping in there the entire night! This happens Every. Single. Night.

Nick just wants to sleep next to Nick's big warm man & snuggle. It is so comforting to Nick to reach over & feel him next to Nick. Nick feels that the only reason she can't sleep by herself is because her dad has gotten her accustomed to sleeping with him. She knows that if she wakes him up, he will go lay with her. So Nick suggested that instead of laying with her, to maybe start weaning her off of sleeping with him & instead just go in to her room, kiss her/comfort her & tell her that daddy is right in the next room & that she is safe. It seemed like a reasonable request because he has told Nick before that he wants her to start sleeping by herself & that she is too old to sleep with him now.

But when Nick suggested that, he got so angry at Nick @ 3:30am. He started yelling at Nick telling Nick that Nick doesn't understand because Nick doesn't have kids bla bla bla. What he seems to forget is that Nick was a 6yo girl once, & Nick is a female who was born with a maternal instinct. & it hurt because Nick tries to be a good role model/affectionate mother figure (Nick would not try to replace their mother) to his children. Nick knows he loves his children dearly & Nick wouldn't ever want that to change. But Nick really thinks it is time for her to be weaned off of sleeping in their bed. AITA for feeling this way? Is Nick really being insensitive to her needs?

TLDR Nick's boyfriend's 6yo (almost 7) daughter is so used to sleeping in dads bed that she will refuse to sleep alone in her room right next door to theirs. She wakes boyfriend/dad up & he goes to sleep with her leaving Nick cold & lonely just about every night.

Nick's sister was the typical annoying little sister and Nick was the mean older brother.  Nick teased her a lot growing up, but Nick did his best to make sure that if he did tease her or if they did have a fight that he said sorry or made her feel like he didn't mean any of it.  Nick never wanted her to go to bed thinking they were not on good terms.

She moved out when Nick was 22 and she was 19, Nick went to her farewell party and he really thought they were good, Nick never apologized for what he did but he was proud of her for going to college.   Nick and his sister stayed in contact about once a month just saying how their lives are going, They weren't close but they weren't pushing it and Nick enjoyed seeing her tell him what was going on in her life.    She came back for thanksgiving when Nick was 23 and she was 20, and it went well.  Nick saw her in person like one more time at christmas when he was 25 and she was 22.  Nick didn't go to any family holidays on his side for like 3 years since he got really serious with his SO (they got engaged 2 months ago).  and Nick went to her families place for those holidays since they lived closer.

The whole party was fine and Nick knows his parents were happy that both their kids were together in their house again.  At night when Nick's parents went to bed.  Nick was having a drink with his sister, when his SO was going to the store for breakfast material.  The subject of their past years somehow came up, Nick told her he feels bad and he's sorry for any troubles he gave her during that time. Nick could tell she was kinda miffed and idk if it was the alcohol talking but she basically said that once their parents die, she doesn't want much to do with Nick cause how much of an ass he was when they were kids.  Nick was SHOCKED when she said that, because he thought they both moved on from that and thought they had a loving/caring (yet distant) relationship.  Nick didn't even know what to say, Nick was/am heart broken because he does love her and always wanted them to at least be caring towards each other but she basically said she has no desire to do much with Nick kinda hurt.  Nick finally got it out and said ""what we did as kids was YEARS ago and if your still on about that then you just need to grow up, I'm sorry how I treated you but it shouldn't be the basis of why you hate me now.""

She didn't say anything after that but ""you done?"" and then went to bed. The next day she talked to Nick like nothing happened, Nick was weirded out by that but didn't want to make a scene in front of their parents who still have the view of them being close.

1,"Nick felt conflicted for asking his wife to shower when she smelled like sour breast milk. His wife had their first baby in June. Nick had 2 weeks of leave and his wife gets 4 months. Their baby breastfeeds and his wife is doing a great job. It's an exhausting ordeal and Nick often acknowledges the hard work she is doing that he doesn't have to do.

Since she's getting ready to go back to work, and so Nick can help more with feeding, she has been building up a milk supply. When she is not nursing the baby she is pumping, and because of some mouth issues the baby has half of its milk given via bottle already.

One thing Nick wasn't prepared for was the smell of sour breastmilk. Nick's wife doesn't have OCD, but she's always been the cleaner one of them, and Nick has been impressed that her habits haven't changed despite the baby. She takes care of their pets and still keeps the house clean (Nick helps out inside the house too but it's always been ""her"" area). However, it seem like milk gets on everything. All over baby, all over his wife, all over towels and blankets, and of course there is the endless supply of bottles and parts that have to be sterilized. It's a lot to take care of but Nick's wife has been amazing. She dotes on the baby and changes its clothes after every feeding, so usually the smell isn't strong on the baby. Unfortunately, that doesn't apply to Nick's wife.

When Nick gets home, the first thing he wants to do is greet his wife and baby. It's the best part of Nick's day, but when he goes to hug/kiss his wife, the smell of soured milk literally makes him gag. It's extra bad when he just came in from outside and can smell it very strong. Nick tries to be tactfully honest with her and explains he knows it isn't from lack of hygiene. She'll change her clothes when Nick gets home but it's still on her skin. It's become a real issue and Nick feels terrible because his wife is already upset about having to return to work and be away from baby, and she's exhausted from taking care of baby alone all day. She said Nick makes her feel disgusting. When Nick asks her to take a shower, she cries and says she hasn't been able to because she's been holding the baby. She says when she hasn't had a minute of alone time all day, the first thing she wants to do when Nick takes the baby from her is not always take a shower.

What's the solution here? Even though Nick is trying to convince her she doesn't disgust him, just the smell does, she says Nick is making her feel awful about something she can't help. Nick even suggested that they hire someone to come give her a break for even just a couple days a week so she could take care of herself, but she said that if Nick says that it means he doesn't think she is able to do it (also while crying). That is not true, but the smell does make Nick gag and as much as Nick tries to suck it up, he can't control it. Nick can't believe that of all things in all the years they have been together, this is what's driving a wedge between them.

1,"AITA for putting Nick's 9yo on a diet and 'emotionally damaging' her? | Nick's ex (32f) and Nick (34m) have a 9yo daughter 'M'.
They broke up when M was 5 and Nick moved away. Nick would see M in breaks and speak on the phone so Nick was as involved as Nick could be.

Last year Nick moved back. Nick now has her alternate weeks.

Nick had noticed M starting to put on weight. She's not obese but seeing her in person, Nick noticed she has a belly which hangs over her waistband, and she wears 12-13 clothes despite being only 9.

Nick spoke to his ex and she got defensive, saying that M ate what she eats (his ex is skinny and healthy) and has a sport she goes to twice a week. Nick asked about portion sizes and other exercise (twice a week for 90mins isn't that much). Nick was trying to stay friendly but his ex shut Nick down.

Nick knows weight gets harder to lose the older you get so Nick decided to keep a close eye and do what Nick could on her weeks with Nick.

Nick did not put her on a crash diet but Nick did start using a portion control plate and packing lean lunches instead of letting her buy her food. (Carrot sticks, yogurt, flavoured steamed chicken breast etc.) M complained at first but then seemed fine with this.

Nick also took her to the gym with Nick 4 times a week; Nick's gym has parent and child classes.

The only thing Nick said to M about it is that they were working to set her up for the future being physically fit and mindful of what she eats.

So last week a kid is having a birthday and the parents are taking a small group to the movies and after to sleepover. The parents asked that everyone send their kid with their own snack and then the parents would buy popcorn on top to share.

Nick was trying to show his kid that snacks can be healthy, so Nick sent her with a bag of veggie sticks and hummus. She made a little fuss about not getting candy but seemed fine.

Nick dropped her off and his ex was gonna pick her up. Next day Nick's ex texts. Nick heads over and his ex isn't happy, M is upset and won't look at Nick.
Apparently when they were sat waiting for the movie kids started comparing snacks. M told the other kids that they were gonna get fat and unhealthy bc their parents gave them those snacks. She said she had to eat the veggies so she could lose weight, and she wasn't allowed any popcorn (Nick never said this).
Then at their house after they ordered pizza for the kids M refused to eat saying she was gonna get fat. The parents called Nick's ex and she came and got her.

M was crying saying that she was scared if she ate anything bad she'd put on weight and everyone would hate her. She told Nick's ex about their diet and gym. Nick hadn't because it was Nick's weeks and why should Nick divulge all their plans.

Nick's ex ranted saying M always came home tired and refusing to eat. She blames Nick for giving M a complex when she was healthy and active. Nick said if she was healthy she wouldn't have a belly and be bigger than other girls. Nick said that at least Nick cared about what the girl puts in her mouth and she said M was happier before Nick moved back. Now Nick's ex is telling Nick she won't send her back to Nick if Nick doesn't stop 'emotionally damaging' her.

1,"NTA for getting Nick's grandsons hair cut?? | This obviously isn't from today but it came up and had Nick wondering if Nick really did do something wrong. Nick has a 2 year old grandson with hair that grows insanely fast. His hair was past his shoulders when he got his first haircut at 4 months old. Nick's daughter is super picky about hair. She pretty much refuses to try out new hairstylists unless necessary and once she finds one she likes won't see anyone else.

Well his hair was starting to get pretty long and messy because he hadn't had a haircut in a while, she said she didn't have the money at the moment but would get it cut when she did anytime Nick mentioned it. Nick asked if Nick could take him to get it cut, and she said only if Nick used his stylist. It's at this one kids place and after tip the haircuts are nearly $30. Nick said Nick didn't want to spend that much on a 2 year olds hair and that Nick'd take him to the place Nick usually goes.

She refused to let Nick take him if it wasn't hers, so Nick dropped it. A bit later, they watched him while she was sick, and she had a prescription she asked if they could grab for her. Nick figured to pass the time waiting for the medicine Nick'd go get him a haircut. Nick took him to Nick's stylist, since they only charge like $10 for kids.

Well she wasn't used to cutting childrens hair. She had a hard time cutting it with him moving around so much, and ended up just doing the best she could. It wasn't horrible, but it was fairly choppy and uneven. There was no way she was going to be able to fix it though because he kept pulling away and trying to push the scissors away.

Anyways, when they took him back home she freaked out the second she saw him asking what the hell they did to her child's hair. Nick told her Nick took him to get his hair cut, and she said that this is EXACTLY why she said not to in the first place, now her sons hair is all screwed up and they cut it too short to even be able to take him to get it properly fixed elsewhere without shaving it all off. She was nearly in tears over it. Nick told her Nick was simply trying to help out because his hair was getting too long and messy, but she didn't want to hear it. Every time Nick saw her or talked to her after that, she would make a comment about how awful his poor hair looked and she sure hoped it hurried and grew out so she could get it cut properly.

She did get it cut later on, and even during that haircut she was telling the stylist about how Nick didn't listen to her last time and let someone screw his hair up. Well she just told Nick ""just so you know, when this is over with, you are NOT getting his hair cut. He can wait until I can take him, even if it's a month or so after I have this baby.""

Nick thought it wasn't a big deal, but she's still mad, her husband actually seemed upset about it, and Nick's wife got mad at Nick too, and the hairstylist laughed at Nick and said ""yeah, grandpa lost his privileges to take him for haircuts with that screw up!"" when they were talking about it.

What's suppose to be a celebratory day turns into a fightfest with both of them in separate rooms crying or upset.

Last year, Nick gifted his wife expensive tickets to a show Nick thought she might enjoy. She got upset that Nick spent hundreds of dollars on a concert for an artist that she never once expressed in. She claimed that Nick got the tickets because Nick wanted to see the concert. Nick honestly thought it would be a cool experience for the both of them to see this iconic band.

This year, Nick wanted to surprise his wife for V-day with something nice. Nick rented a nice ass car for the day to take her out, bought her flowers/candy, wrote her 5 nice cards, took her to lunch, movie, store, and had an evening activity planned as well. While she was ok at first, she started to get cranky 5 hours into the day because she didn't have a chance to get coffee because Nick was taking her around from 1 place to another. (Nick will say that his wife is extremely religious about her coffee. She knows what she likes and doesn't like when it comes to coffee and needs ONE cup every day). To be fair, Nick did have a lot of stuff planned today. She was also stressed because she had a job interview (she is currently unemployed) and Nick went with her to the interview in the fancy car so that they could start the planned day of activities right after. Just today, here is what she complained about:

Nick not going to sleep on time (reason for Nick's tiredness)

Nick doesn't get it. Nick tries and she's not happy. Every time Nick surprises her with nice things or notes, she questions it.  

Anyways, they got into an argument and she told Nick she's tired of Nick being depressed on every other day and then being all perky for an occasion. It seems fake to her. Nick told her that she's a sad person too. She took that to heart and called Nick a defensive asshole and left his car to walk the rest of her way home.

1,"AITA for telling Nick's friend to go home to her baby? | A good friend of Nick's was celebrating her birthday this weekend. It was her 30th so she decided on dinner and a night out clubbing. Both Nick and her friend had babies this year. Nick's is 7 months old and hers in 9 weeks old. She isn’t with the father so she had another one of their close friend’s—who was to be in attendance—have her mother watch the baby. She expected to watch the baby overnight and that they’d all sleep at someone’s house at the end of the night as you’re no good to an infant if you’re drunk.  

Nick doesn’t live in the same city as birthday girl so Nick made Nick's way over, baby in tow, to the city where most of Nick's friends live and where the birthday was being celebrated. Nick's sister also lives in the city so she’d be babysitting for Nick that night. Nick could have left baby with dad but Nick didn’t feel comfortable leaving the baby alone with him from Friday-Monday. Nick's 5 hours away so it’s not close enough that Nick thought it appropriate.  

Nick gets to the city the party’s being held and and drops Nick's baby off at Nick's sisters and heads out.  

They get to *decorated house* and start getting ready. Everyone is pre-drinking, doing make up and getting ready. Nick was soooo looking forward to going out with Nick's friends but it just wasn’t in the books for Nick. Nick got ready, did Nick's hair, make up, put on a dress and was ready to head out the door. Collectively, they took so long to get ready that dinner was cancelled and everyone decided to go straight to the club. Nick broke it to all Nick's friends individually that Nick wouldn’t be coming. They understood. Nick didn’t so much as take a shot so Nick drove to Nick's sister and knocked out.  

The next day (Saturday), Nick's friends tell Nick they went out, some of them went back to decorated house and drank until the afternoon when they all passed out. Some of them wok up around 3/4 am and that’s when Birthday Girl got a call from a guy she’s interested in. He invited her over to come have some drinks and she decided to go. Another friend of Nick's who was still over told Nick this when Nick spoke to her around 8am the next morning. Nick told her Nick was disappointed in Birthday Girl and that she shouldn’t be going out on paper tying benders with a small infant. She agreed. Nick told her Nick thought someone should tell her her behavior is inappropriate and that she should go home to her baby. She said Nick should do so because Nick's also a new mom.  

Nick sent her a text:  

""[Redacted]. I love you. [redacted] is an infant, two weeks ago he was a newborn. You can’t leave him for this long. He doesn’t show it but he misses you. One night is ok but he’s so small now. A year from today he’s gonna be a big boy who will sleep through the night. Give him some time, as he gets older you’ll gain more freedom. We both know it’s stressful being a mother but we have to manage our stress levels before it gets to this point.  ❤️""

1,"Was Nick the asshole for speaking to his sister about his wife's financial concerns for an event that his wife said she couldn't afford to attend? | Nick's (31M) wife (34F) was recently invited to his younger sister's (29F) hen do happening this month. She showed Nick the invite, and almost immediately stated to Nick that there was no way she could go as she had no money and wouldn't be able to afford it, and how everyone else will have money to do things and she won't.  

(She's concerned as she only works a few hours each weekend, and the money she gets often goes (but not always) for household/kid's needs. She has access to their ""joint account"", which is where Nick's salary goes in, and which pays for all rent/bills/car payments/everything else.)  

Nick would love for her to go, especially as she's been wanting some time away from the kids and normal routine, so he messaged his older sister (40F) who is planning the hen do and asked how much money his wife would need for the day, so that his wife would know what to expect/budget for. She replied that it's a very low key affair, mostly at her home, but one part will have a small cost and she'd be happy to pay for Nick's wife because she'd love for her to come. Nick replied asking to know any costs and that he would contribute as well if needed. It ends up that the cost would be less than £20.  

Yesterday Nick's wife went through Nick's phone (no issue there: they have nothing to hide) and sees the messages between Nick and his sister. Immediately she goes into a rant saying things like ""I can't believe you've done that, I'm not a charity case, you've made me feel so small, you'd hate it if my family did this to you, I'm so embarrassed"" and stormed off and gave Nick the silent treatment/refused all physical affection all night, and was clearly in a foul mood with Nick this morning.  

Today she mentioned that she had asked her coworkers about it (although she had phrased it in terms of Nick controlling what money she could or couldn't have) and of course they all sided with her. She was still adamant that Nick had ""done wrong"" by ""going behind her back"" to have him or his sister pay for her, and that she wasn't a ""charity case"". She then said that she'd pay for it herself anyway, or that she'd just use the joint account(!). By the end of the argument, she was in a foul mood, and Nick was back in the doghouse again. Nick's argument to her was that his sister's generosity was borne out of no bad intention, and that him getting involved was was also not ill-intentioned.  

Nick's initial feeling was that his wife is being pretty rude and ungrateful, but he understands that there's always some embarrassment when you feel that you can't afford something that someone then pays for you. However, if that thing is paid for out of generosity and love and affection, then why not be grateful and not look a gift horse in the mouth. He would love it if someone paid for a day out for him!

1,"AITA for insulting Nick's cheating ex over the fact her father left her as a child? | Hi, this is a throwaway as Nick doesn’t want this linked to his main account. Apologies for mobile formatting yada yada.  

So Nick will get right into it. Nick (19m) goes to a top university in the UK. He is a second year and lives with his ex girlfriend (19f) and 3 of their mutual friends. This came about because in Nick’s first year, he started dating his now ex near the start of Uni and they all decided to live together for second year. Near the end of the year she cheated on him by sleeping with some random bloke she’d pulled in a club. Nick confronted her and broke it off.  

Fast forward to September and the arrangement is now very awkward as they’re not on speaking terms, yet share a house. There is a lot of tension and mutual dislike in the air. She has done a lot of petty things so far this year which Nick won’t get into, but safe to say she’s pissed off everyone in the house and there are arguments almost daily.  

Well a couple of nights ago Nick was coming back from a night out with his friends at around 2 or 3am, and it’s possibly important here to note that she doesn’t have any friends at university, whereas Nick is involved in several societies, was always the ‘popular’ social butterfly of their house, goes out multiple times a week etc and that this was always a point of contention during their relationship as, though she didn’t like to admit it, she was always jealous.  

Nick went into the kitchen to fill up a bottle of water. He is quite drunk at this point. Well lo and behold she is in there and turns to him to say something along the lines of ‘drunk again?’ With a smirk and belittled him for enjoying himself. Nick said it’s not his fault she’s a loner and that nobody likes her, they argued a bit about cleaning and other household issues. She then says that at least Adam liked her and that’s why she cheated because he was better than him, which really pissed him off.  

Nick mentions how lonely it must be to have no friends and family being so far away and asks if she heard him the other night with a girl he’d brought home. She said she’s glad she hurt him and asked if he’s mentally recovered. She knew he had on and off mental health issues while they dated. Which was the final straw as he had further mental health issues for most of that summer as a direct result of her. Nick said to her, shouting, ‘at least my daddy didn’t fucking leave me when I was 5, if he could see you now he’d leave all over again you dirty little cunt.’  

She burst out crying and ran from the kitchen. She had her mum pick her up the next day, and Nick hasn’t seen her since. His housemates, who already dislike her are on his side. His friends and family are also on his side for the most part.  
Nick knew her insecurities from their time together and said the most hurtful thing he could muster, specifically targeting what he knew would cause the most pain and distress and probably took it too far, so while he hates her, he’s aware he’s probably in the wrong, though remorse still eludes him.

1,"AITA for criticising Nick's boyfriend's death at his school memorial? | N (18 M) and Nick graduated high school last year together. N was genuinely faultless. He was such a gentle, kind soul, but he had his personal problems. You know, being ""perfect"" always has its downsides. For every issue N felt like he couldn't fix in any aspect of his life, that made him sad. And beyond his social life with his girlfriend (Nick) and his friends, his family life was really troubled. His parent (mother) was absent when he was 2, and his older brother; a drug-addict, criminally convicted drop kick (opposite to N, who was a straight A student and a guy who cared for the feelings of those close to him), couldn't even maintain a job. He'd just end up let go after so long. N and their father helped N's older brother find work and would allow them to stay at their place when he'd eventually lose work. It was tough for all of them. N's dad is nice man and he's the one Nick truly felt for in this situation. Nick tried her best to reassure N with lots of affection and love, but it worked only for short moments.

It all wasn't enough for N though. 2nd of January early morning, Nick got a text from N's brother that N had been found dead in a car wreck into a ditch with a few friends. Apparently they were all drunk celebrating New Years and the driver and two other passengers died at the scene too. When Nick first heard of N's death... she was mad. Anger at N's friends who admitted to cops they pressured him into drinking that night, and anger at herself for not being with him prior to that morning. At the same time Nick felt sad, but no tears came out. She felt blank. She couldn't grieve properly for the love of her life. How pathetic was that? So Nick's parents recommended she see a therapist for a few days which helped for naught. Waste of money to be honest.

And so, this memorial was held for him with tons of people who knew and loved N seated in a gymnasium at their old school start of Feb, and Nick was just so angry for N. She couldn't breathe. So when it was Nick's time to speak, instead of the pre-written garbage she wrote, Nick simply said off her head: ""Why is Nick upset about N leaving? Because he didn't need to. It wasn't his fault. He was abandoned by people, and misused by people. His friends and family was shitty. And now he's gone. He left her behind. She can't breathe because of him. Nick doesn't know about you, but to her, he was just scared. You may love him, like she does. And she loves him with every inch of her heart, but it doesn't change the fact that he died without ever living life properly."" Nick spoke more of the same thing, lambasting people N knew, and praising N at the same time.

Nick's ""eulogy"" for N was met with disgust from just about everybody Nick knew just after she finished, particularly N's dad who is hung up on Nick naming N's shitty family which Nick admits she should have made the distinction didn't include his dad, and N's brother (ick), who called Nick a ""fucking heartless cunt"". Nick can't take that from N's brother of all people, whose failures she's sure contributed to N's state of mind. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,2,Care,593
1,"AITA for canceling a hotel reservation with Nick's pregnant friend before consulting her? Nick is going out of town for a wedding this weekend and was supposed to stay in an Airbnb with three friends - Mandy; Annie, who is six months pregnant; and Annie's husband, Dan. It will feel like 100+ degrees F when they are there this weekend.

Yesterday morning, Nick noticed that their Airbnb did not have air conditioning. Nick reached out to the host and asked them about window units, and ultimately they were only able to install one, in the living room. Nick was worried for Annie's health, and she didn't want to stay in that heat, either, so Nick called Airbnb to see what her recourse was. Nick's intention wasn't necessarily to outright cancel, but to see if maybe they could move them, and what their options would be if they couldn't. After two hours on the phone with them, the only option they gave Nick was to cancel, and they managed to negotiate with the host to let them cancel with a partial (half) refund - originally, the host wanted to give them nothing. Nick was on the phone and forced to make a decision, so she accepted and canceled. They each lost about $50 with the cancellation. Had this all been happening over email, Nick would've texted them and gotten their okay before proceeding, but she had to make the choice over the phone.. so she did.

Nick hadn't told Annie about any of this because she didn't want to stress her out, but Nick did tell Mandy. Mandy was of course frustrated that they had lost $50, she agreed that it was the right choice. Then Nick called Annie. Annie was livid. Annie told Nick that Nick had no right to make ""decisions about her health and her body"" and that Nick should've talked to her before doing anything. Annie didn't let Nick explain how this had all come about. Nick told Annie she had spoke with some friends who would let Annie stay with them for free, and Annie said she didn't want to do that. Nick told Annie they could book a hotel and Mandy and Nick would even split the cost if money was the concern, and Annie said no. Annie told Nick she would talk it over with Dan and get back to Nick on next steps. A few hours later, Annie texted Nick and said that Nick could book a hotel but Annie would only pay up to a certain amount, and they ""owed her"" for stressing her out.

Nick was surprised by how angry Annie got, but whatever, Nick figured it was over. Then this morning Annie texts Nick and says she needs to tell Nick how she feels for the sake of their friendship. Annie sends four very long texts saying that ""unless [me] and Dan are dead, you don't get to make decisions about me and my family"" and there are f-bombs and saying that Nick had no right to make any decisions or get other people involved in this situation.

Nick is flabbergasted at how upset Annie got last night, and Nick is even more flabbergasted by Annie's texts this morning. Nick has never had a friend speak to her this way, and Nick feels like Annie has blown things wayyyyy out of proportion. At this point Nick has absolutely no interest in being around Annie, so she is planning to pay for her part of the hotel but stay with her friends. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,3,1,3,Care,591
1,"AITA for sending his son to live at his grandfathers? | Nick's first wife died when his oldest son was 3 and his youngest was only 9 months old. Nick remarried when they were 8 and 5 and then had another son with his Second Wife (SW) when they were 10 and 7. Nick's first two boys never fully got along with his SW, but they did learn to get better as they got older, even though the older one never fully got along with her.

To put things lightly they fought a lot. There was usually a blowout once every month or two and they could never see eye to eye. A good portion of the fights were caused when Nick's oldest would call her on anything he felt was unfair, especially in the treatment of Nick's youngest to the older two. The youngest definitely did get preferential treatment, but that's what you'd expect from someone caring for their actual child as apposed to kids that came with Nick as a package deal. 

They both went to therapy separately to try and work things out when Nick's oldest was 14 and he told Nick his therapist told him to stop engaging her as they saw no other alternative. SW didn't like that and threatened to divorce Nick but she also hadn't worked since Nick's youngest was born so she wouldn't have any source of income meaning she'd take Nick's money, youngest son, and consequently Nick's house away if that were to happen. They wen't to therapy together and worked many of their issues out but the issue with her and Nick's oldest still stood.

Nick got them to go to therapy together after that and it only lasted one session because she spent the entire hour telling the therapist all the nasty things she felt about him. He didn't talk to Nick much after that and Nick found the whole situation very hard because Nick didn't want to choose sides to make it look like Nick favoured one or the other. That was the case for most of the arguments between them, where Nick just didn't know what to do and Nick didn't want to pick sides. Nick's relationship with his oldest became more and more distant after that but things started to turn around when he went to university.

He came back however, and fought with his younger brother (16 at the time) and they didn't speak for a month. He then went to work at a summer camp he'd been working at for 4 years and called Nick a month and a half in saying he wanted to go home because he wasn't happy with how the new leadership was treating the staff that year. He was fighting with his step mom, now his brother, and his camp too. Nick couldn't handle it so Nick sent him to live with his grandfather and he hasn't talked to Nick since.

It's been 2 years and he still hasn't spoken to Nick and Nick's starting to wonder if Nick's decision to have him elsewhere was wrong. Nick couldn't handle the fighting but he called Nick asking to come home. He was fighting for better working conditions and he was an essential team member to that camp so Nick knows his heart was in the right place even if he was fighting once again.

1,"AITA for not wanting Nick's boyfriend's children to stay at their house? | Nick had been with her boyfriend for five years; they got together after he and his wife mutually agreed to separate, and they have two daughters together. For the first year of their relationship they were under the impression that his ex would be leaving the country, taking the girls, and Nick would probably never even meet them. She advised him on the day of their departure that she was just going for a holiday and would be back in three weeks to continue living in the house they own.

For the next few years his ex refused to allow Nick to meet the girls, saying she didn't want them around her boyfriend's ""whore"", etc. Nick eventually met them and for about a year they formed a friendship, although Nick has no interest in children and doesn't want any of her own. During this time Nick's boyfriend stayed the night at his ex's house a couple of times, and Nick saw them maybe six times.

A year ago, Nick and her boyfriend bought a house large enough for the girls to stay over. Nick bought them beds and they stayed a few times. Six months ago, Nick's boyfriend got a raise, and the gov advised him that he had moved up some bracket and would be paying a substantial amount more child support. Even his ex agreed it was a lot and they organised that he would have custody of the girls one night a week. He only told Nick that he would have the girls sometimes and didn't elaborate. Nick didn't question it as, of course, they are his children.

Nick checked their calendar and the girls staying over had been added every second Saturday. The girls, now 8 and 5, were exhausting and messed the place up...okay. Then Nick's jewellery started going missing, and Nick's make up was broken and messy. The girls started stomping footprints onto the newly painted walls, rollerblading on the carpet, and hanging around in Nick's study, playing with Nick's stuff and yelling while Nick was studying. Nick's boyfriend knows Nick is uncomfortable telling someone else's kids what to do, especially given his ex's feelings on Nick seeing them, but Nick's boyfriend didn't tell them to stop until Nick would ask him to.

On their last visit, the 5 year old snuck off to Nick's bedroom to bother Nick's 15 year old cat, even though she has been told not to. Nick was ashamed to admit that Nick knew she was in there, but it was late and Nick thought the cat could just take one for the team. When Nick later went in there, the cat was showing the whites of her eyes and flinched when the 5 year old spoke. The next day Nick picked up the cat, who started screaming. The vet said she had a ""tail pull injury"" and asked if there were young children in the house. Nick's boyfriend denies the 5 year old did it, as she wouldn't lie to him.

Finally the stress of the situation got to Nick and Nick broke down and told her boyfriend the girls couldn't stay any more, at least not right now and so often, and Nick was willing to break up with him if that wasn't negotiable, which is true. He has agreed in the short term while they work something out, but Nick feels like an asshole for not letting his kids stay in his own house. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,3,2,3,Care,590

She is not originally from the country while Nick is and they are both 20 years old. About 4 weeks ago they found out that Nick's girlfriend is pregnant which was unplanned and did not happen due to stupidity but through a medical mistake. They both agreed on an abortion. They have visited a specific clinic for a check up where they told them they can't do the procedure at the moment due to her having a low iron level and anemia so they got sent away with the instruction to get iron pills and come back later. Soon after that the nausea related to pregnancy hit Nick's girlfriend very hard. She already has been mentally through a lot and takes antidepressants to help her so soon the whole thing started being really tough not only physically but also mentally for her and she kept on saying that she can't bear this much longer. So at one point she said that she will get an iron infusion to get her iron level up fast because she could not keep the iron pills down and they got an appointment for the clinic right after that to get the procedure. They went to her home country to see her GP who drew her blood and said that her iron level is perfectly fine. With this knowledge they went to their appointment which she had to attend by herself due to the health crisis. After the appointment she told Nick they didn't do anything and just tested her iron level and then said it was way too low and they would not do it. She started crying after that and while they drove back she did not talk and seemed to be in her own headspace. Nick was holding her hand whenever it was possible while driving to at least somehow be there for her. Shortly before they arrived at the point where they would pick up her mom she asked "" so what is the plan now?"" And Nick said that Nick did not know and Nick would hold on to Nick's previously already talked about plan to drive back by train to Nick's family as soon they picked up her mom. After that she started being super quiet and did only answer in one words when Nick asked something. They picked up her mom and they dropped Nick off at the train station. So now it is a day later and the texting with her was very cold so Nick asked what was wrong to what she replied that she felt left alone by Nick because Nick just left her after yesterday was so horrible for her. She also stated that she was already feeling horrible for weeks and that she was in constant pain and the nausea was literal torture for her and that she would have just wished that Nick would have stayed with her until the next appointment not only to just be there but also to figure out what to do. She literally said Nick left her alone and she needed Nick to comfort her which Nick tried by holding her hand in the car.

Nick doesn't get many opportunities to pick his son up from school due to his work schedule, but yesterday Nick had off to take care of some business. Nick finished early, a little after lunch time and was bored. Nick wanted to surprise his son and pick him up early from school to take him to frogurt and the mall. Nick and his wife do Christmas 'month' in their house so they randomly give little gifts or do random nice things for them in the spirit of ""Christmas month"" for all of December.

Nick went to the school; security measures had been stepped up like crazy and Nick loved that, sad to need it but anyways, the front office lady wanted to call Nick's son to the office but Nick declined and said he wanted to walk into class and see his son's face when he saw Nick.

Worth it.

Nick's son was super excited. He ran to Nick immediately. Big hug. Awesome shit.

Nick told his son to get his stuff as Nick was ""rescuing"" him from the rest of his school day. His son sprinted back to his desk. When Nick caught up with him, Nick could tell something was wrong. His son pointed at the picture on his desk which was now covered in all kinds of stickers, smiley faces, a lot of pink girly princess ones, but over the drawing he had made of his family at the fair together and Nick could see how hurt his son was.

The girl who did this to Nick's son is not unheard of. Nick and his wife ask their son how his day is everyday and not often but sometimes he'll bring up something (let's call her Sara) did that was mean spirited or kinda cruel. Nick and his wife always teach kindness and respect to even those who don't deserve it.

So there Sara is; Nick swears to god in the most innocent but evil voice Nick had ever heard, Sara asked Nick's son ""do you like it?"" while giggling. Nick's son shouted ""you ruined it!"" And Sara responded with a ""this was our present to you, we think it looks a lot better now"" and Nick pulled his son away as Nick's son was visibly losing his shit.

Nick weighed the options immediately. Talk to the parents. Turn the other cheek. But then Nick thought no, his son is a fantastic kid, selfless, thinks of others, is always kind. What good would teaching him to just be bullied do? So Nick made the decision to get even. Nick told his son how sorry Nick was and how Nick could tell it was an amazing picture, but to grab the sticker book. His son looked up at Nick puzzled, got the big sticker book from its place in the class, and Nick told him to pick out his favorite ones. The plan was to originally put a lot on Sara's but her drawing was a princess, that took up the whole page, so Nick and his son put one basketball sticker on her face that made it look actually really funny. Like Dwight with his head in the pumpkin.

When Sara saw it she was furious and yelled ""why did you do that?"" - While Nick and his son were walking out the room, Nick said with finality ""you shouldn't mess with anybody's things if you don't want them to mess with yours.""

1,"WIBTA if Nick stopped talking to his friend who he has feelings for after giving her an explanation | In September Nick started university and met this girl who he became really good friends with. After about a month Nick decided to ask her out and she rejected him saying she was dating someone. Nick took a few days to think about whether he could stay friends and eventually he told her he was fine with it (big mistake in retrospect).

As time went they've grown closer to the point of doing things which Nick feels only a couple would do like spending the whole day together, going over to each other's house alone, even going to a ball together. They even made plans to go only the two of them to a christmas market 3 hours away. Nick has also been really confused because aside from that one time she never gave any indication that she was with someone. She never mentioned anyone, didn't have pictures of anyone on social media, etc... which Nick thinks contributed to him letting this thing go on. Eventually this week, Nick overheard someone talking about her dating this mutual ""friend"" of theirs and not much later he saw him groping her in the club where she told him to stop and seemed annoyed. Nick has never really vibed with this guy because he always does mean things like cut Nick off while he's talking but nevertheless Nick can't avoid him as they have many mutual friends.

This has confused Nick because she has given no indication at all that she likes him or is involved with him. At events they often don't even sit together, and have never made public displays of affection. She has never told Nick anything like that, and she doesn't appear to be particularly good friends with him (for example this term they have done all group work together, and he only joined one group because Nick suggested it, hoping to get on better terms with him)). In lectures she always sits with Nick not him.

On the last day before the break, they were both going home Nick asked her if she'd wanna do part of the train ride together. They met up and who else but he was there too which she didn't mention. Nick ended up having no opportunity to ask her in person. In the end after Nick said bye to her he ended up texting her to ask her whether it was true to which she responded that it was and that she ""doesn't like to talk about personal things"", that she wanted to mention it to Nick since they are friends but that she doesn't like to talk about it so much.

Nick feels really stupid, blindsided and humiliated. It's also made him realise that many things he has said were much meaner than Nick first thought, and Nick even wonders if she hasn't told him she rejected Nick. Nick feels also betrayed by her and feels like she has been leading him on all semester.

So WIBTA if Nick stopped talking to her and essentially from now on acted like they don't exist (avoiding events where they will be, not sitting with her in class), but told her why to give her closure saying that it's because Nick still likes her and won't get over her, omitting the part where Nick has felt disrespected and humiliated because she doesn't need to hear that?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,3,Care,585
1,"Was Nick the asshole for accusing his girlfriend of faking (over dramatising) a seizure when they went to the mall? Nick (31m) has been with his girlfriend Charlotte (24f) for 2 years. Charlotte had epilepsy as a baby and child but hasn't had a fit since she was 6 years old. Now as a baby Charlotte had a traumatic brain injury at around 8 months old when her brother accidentally pulled a book case down on her, it partially caved in her skull which left her in a coma for 2 months, but she recovered well.  

It's important to mention these 2 things because despite a rough start with the injury and she has had no trouble or seizures since.  

She gets migraine headaches but that may be unrelated.  

So, this morning, they decided to go to the local mall for some bits and pieces. They split up and went to separate shops.  

Half an hour later Charlotte calls Nick's cell crying asking where he is. Nick told her to calm down and tell him where she is. She said she was really confused and described what shops were nearby. Nick went to meet her and she was still crying.  

She said she was in the middle of the shop when suddenly she didn't know where she was. It's hard to describe it like she did because it was gibberish. She said it's like she suddenly woke up in the store and had no idea how she got there and had no idea how long she had been there. From one second shopping and then suddenly finding herself standing in the store, Nick asked her what the last thing she remembered was but she said she wasn't sure because everything felt surreal. She said it was the strangest feeling but what bothered her most was that she felt like she had been in the store for hours despite suddenly finding herself there? Are you seeing the holes in her logic yet?  

Charlotte asked Nick to take her home because her vision went blurry like it does before she gets a migraine. They drove home and Nick admits he was a little pissed off because this was the first day off he had had in ages and he didn't get chance to get anything.  

When they were home Charlotte took her migraine medicine and called her doctor and got an appointment for tomorrow morning but was advised to go to the hospital if her migraine got worse. Anyway it eased up with the codeine and she went to sleep. When she woke up she said she thinks it may have been a type of seizure. Now Nick isn't a doctor obviously but he knows what a seizure looks like and this sounds nothing like a seizure. She didn't faint or spasm or injure herself.  

She literally just spaced out in the store and had what sounds like a major panic attack that they had to drop their shopping and dinner plans for.  

Nick wasn't expecting her to blow up about it, but she said he was being a complete jerk. She isn't the attention grabbing type but Nick thinks it might have been like a pre migraine panic attack but she completely denies this saying she literally seemed to wake up in the store.  

She has gone to lay back down because she feels sick after migraines and Nick does feel like a jerk but he doesn't think it was a seizure at all. Was Nick the asshole?",False,False,4,2,3,2,1,3,Care,581
1,"WIBTA if Nick lied to her husband about having a miscarriage when in reality she would be getting an abortion? Nick, 32(F), and her husband, 41(M), have been together for 12 years and married for 11. 6 months into their marriage, they had their lovely daughter Belle, who passed away when she was 2 years old. After their daughter's passing Nick's husband had an affair with his close friend which resulted in a baby girl Zoe. Now Zoe's mother was a troubled woman who suffered from post partum depression, which ultimately took her life. Nick's husband was regretful of his actions and worked hard to prove that he was willing to be loyal from that day on. Nick decided to forgive him and accept the baby as her own. 

Zoe is now 6 years old and is a bright young girl. Nick loves her but one thing which has been bothering Nick a lot is that Zoe looks a lot like her mother. Somehow when Nick looks at Zoe's face for too long, Nick gets triggered. 

After the cheating, Nick has struggled with being intimate with her husband. Things improved in the last 3 years, and Nick's husband had recently expressed his desire of having another child. He has been really desperate for a baby. Now all this time, Nick has taken pills in secret, however, Nick ended up conceiving 2 months ago on a family trip. 

Nick forgot to take pills one morning, and Nick ended up pregnant. Nick's husband is beyond excited. He cried happy tears when Nick told him about the pregnancy.

 Zoe has been going all around telling her friends that she was going to become a big sister. Nick's inlaws feel that this baby will finally heal their wounds. Nick's husband talks to Nick's belly all the time. He is being incredibly affectionate and loving. He gets emotional whenever he talks about the baby. 

Now the biggest problem is that Nick doesn't feel connected to this baby at all. Recently, an ex came into Nick's life after 10 years. They have reconnected and their friendship is going strong. They often talk about their lives. He recently got cheated on and left, so they've talked to each other about their experiences. 

Things took a drastic turn for Nick last week when Nick saw a dream. In the dream, Nick had just given birth to her baby and Nick's husband was there holding their baby in his arms. When Nick looked up to see her husband's face, Nick saw her ex. Nick's actual husband wasn't there in the dream and neither was Zoe. 

Ever since Nick saw the dream, Nick has come to the realization that Nick no longer sees a future with her husband. Nick does want a family of her own someday, but Nick doesn't want a baby WITH HIM. 


Nick has been thinking of getting an abortion but can't tell her husband because it will destroy him. Nick really wants to leave this marriage and start over. Nick wants to explore where things go with her ex. Their relationship ended because of distance and bad timing. Nick is pretty positive her ex still has feelings for her, but has never expressed his feelings out of respect for Nick's marriage. 

WIBTA if Nick lied to her husband about having a miscarriage when in reality she would be getting an abortion? Nick plans to divorce him next year so Nick doesn't want him to know that Nick didn't want this baby and hurt him more.",False,False,4,3,2,1,2,3,Care,581
1,"AITA for ignoring Nick's[27m] girlfriend[26f] for a week? | Nick has been dating this amazing girl for 6 months now. Due to recent events, Nick has not seen her for a month now since they live an hour away. 

Just as some background, Nick and her both suffer from depression. When winter rolled around Nick told her there were times where he might just need a day or two to himself, where he doesn’t talk to anyone. She understood and says she may do the same. So far it’s happened twice, once when Nick needed a day and once when she needed a day. 

On Saturday, Nick woke up aggravated and agitated. He has a history of anger issues and when he texted his girlfriend in the morning he told her how he was feeling. She told him to take the day and they could talk later that evening. Nick was happy with that since he was afraid of taking his anger out on her. 

Well the feeling didn’t go away. Nick texted her later that night and thanked her for the space and they said their good nights. 

After that Nick’s week got worse. From Saturday to today he was dealing with more bad news on top of more bad news. He’s not going to get into the specifics, but it’s wiped him out. 

Nick knows his girlfriend has trust issues, so for the first few days they at least said good night to each other and that was it. On the fourth day, she sent him a message saying she was worried about him and it would help her if he checked in so she knew he was alright. Nick won’t lie, his message was short. He said that his week was horrible and he wants to be left alone. Nick personally didn’t think it was her place to be worried about him. 

The next day she only texted him good night, but Nick couldn’t even bring himself to respond to her. The next day she didn’t even send him a good night. 

Today Nick finally reached out to her and let her know he was ready to talk. She told him that while she was happy that he’s ready to talk, that she does not want to listen to it if it’s about the week he had. She said that she had a terrible week, but she couldn’t just hide away like Nick did. Nick lives alone and she lives with her family of 5 others. He knows she deals with huge stresses from them and being as she can’t go to work, she’s been overwhelmed. 

She said that she had enough to deal with and that Nick had his chance to talk to her about this stuff while it was happening. She said she needs to be able to deal with her own sanity, and Nick’s silence gave her an anxiety attack but she knew she couldn’t reach out to him when it happened so she dealt with it on her own. 

Nick told her she knew what she was getting herself into. He had warned her about this kind of stuff. He’s a bit mad at her for blaming her anxiety attack on him and he told her that’s not his responsibility. She got angry and they haven’t talked since. Nick’s debating if he needs to apologize or not. 

Now he’s wondering if him taking that week to himself was an asshole move. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,3,Care,578
