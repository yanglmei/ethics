1,"AITA for asking my BF boss if he can have a day off? | Ive been dating this guy for approximately a year and things have been going well with talk of marriage and such. Hes typically super laid back, except when it comes to sports. He has been a high school girls hockey coach (1 of 2 defensive coordinators, aka NOT a head coach) for the last 3 years. He gets paid a small salary for this job, but its overall less than $5000 for the season. 

This year my family has to celebrate our Thanksgiving early since I have to leave town for work. The only day that worked for everyone was a Friday, and he happened to have a game scheduled for that day. I asked him if he would be willing to ask the head coach if he could miss a game so that he could attend our family Thanksgiving. He flat out refused to even ask, saying that it's a paid position so he has to take his job very seriously. 

I go to all his games to watch, and am acquaintances with the head coach (met him like 5 times). So, after the last game we were all chatting and I casually brought up that I was traveling over the holidays and that we would be celebrating early on a Friday. I mentioned how bummed I was that my BF wouldnt be able to attend because they had a game. The head coach was super understanding and immediately offered to let him skip the game to attend. 

On the ride home I got a serious ass chewing about how embarrassed he was and how ""unprofessional"" it was for me to be asking his ""boss"" for days off for him. He also said what I did makes him look bad and undedicated to the team, and that it could be detrimental to his future coaching career. 

So now naturally I feel horrible about the whole thing, and I regret even asking. AITA for low key asking his head coach if he could skip a game, or is he blowing this out of proportion?",False,False,3,2,4,5,1,3,Authority
0,"AITA for calling my school principal out on BS? | I go to a private christian school and we have a 15 minute period between classes called “chapel time” 3 days a week. Typically it consists of either singing a hymn or a bible lesson or both. 

On this particular day we were handed out a new song and for some reason I ended up with all the extras (probably 50 extra sheets.) I asked the people on either side of me if they wanted to keep passing the stack but they said no. While the papers were being passed out the speaker (who happened to be the principal that day) started his lesson on the meaning behind the song. 

I still had the stack of papers and nowhere to put them so i set them on the floor. The principal continued speaking while i was setting the papers on the floor. Anyways after a couple minutes i got more settled and my head was facing slightly down, as this is the most comfortable position for me to sit in. I should mention i was still listening to what the principal was saying and i wasn’t being distracting. 

While i was looking slightly down i hear the principal stop speaking and go “Is there a problem?” I didn’t know he was talking to me so I didn’t even move my head up to look at him. Still, the room was silent so after 5 or 10 seconds of nobody talking I finally looked up to see what was going on and sure enough, he was staring right at me. I was confused as to what was going on so I said “No, I was just looking slightly down but paying attention.” 
He continued speaking. 

I thought that that would be the end of the story. But about 15 minutes later I get called to the office. The principal sits me down and tells me that my response was very disrespectful. He said I should never talk back to an adult but rather just be silent. I replied by saying that the way he worded the question made it seem like he wanted a response. 
He then says “you also disrupted the whole school and made me stop to discipline you.” 
I responded by saying “You are the one who disrupted chapel time by stopping the whole thing because I was looking down instead of up.” 

I then asked him why he thought I was being a distraction. He said that I was not giving him my full attention and it was obvious because i was not looking at him. 

I told him that out of the many kids in the chapel room, I was not the only person who was not looking directly at him while he was speaking. 
I proceeded to tell him that I thought he was overreacting and misusing his authority. 

He kept insisting that my response was unnecessary and that i should never ever talk back to authority, and I kept insisting that there was no way my behavior was inappropriate. 

Eventually he gave up trying to debate me and we both agreed to think more about our actions before we do them.

0,"AITA for building a 7ft high wall around our backyard without asking our neighbors? | 
My wife and I bought a house with this nice big yard. When we bought it didn’t have a fence or wall around it at all. We wanted to build a tall totally enclosed wall all around our yard to have more privacy and make it safer yard for our dogs.

We only have one house right next to us. An older couple lives there. We were going to talk to them about building the wall, but they never seemed to be home. We learned from a neighbor across the street that they had gone to deal with a family issue. They didn’t know when they would be back and didn’t have any contact information.

After a month though they still weren’t back so we decided to go through with building the wall. We checked the city restrictions and decided to get someone to check the property lines again just in case and built our wall next to our neighbors three foot wall that surrounded their property. We figured they would want to keep their wall as is because they have built in flower beds.

Our neighbors came back today, about 2-3 weeks after the wall was built. We went and chatted with them for a while they were unloading their bags and everything seemed friendly. Then we left to go out for lunch and a movie.

When we got back home around 5 our neighbor came over and knocked on our door. I was in the shower at this time so I’ll let my wife relay what he said.

Basically he said we were very inconsiderate to build our wall without even asking them. 

He said the wall casts a bunch of shade now in their backyard even in the middle of the day. (The sun goes across the southern sky here and our house is on the south side of theirs so that’s probably true).

1,"AITA giving away our daughters dog after she broke her promise | Asking on behalf of my wife and I, so should be “are we assholes.”

Our daughter (11) has begged us to get her a dog for years. We’ve put it off as we have three other younger kids and don’t have the energy to care for a dog on top of that. 

She kept begging and begging as kids do and eventually we relented on the condition that she takes care of him. This includes feeding him, walking him, cleaning up after him, etc. We said this in no uncertain terms multiple times and ofcourse she agrees because she wants a dog.

So we got her a border collie puppy. She looks after it for about a month but begins to slack. Whenever we remind her of our agreement she would take care of it for a week and then stop. This goes on for about 6 months before we get sick of it. My wife and I are the ones taking care of him while my daughter just plays with him. We give her one last chance and sure enough she stops after about a week.

So I let her say goodbye to her pup and sent him away to live on a farm (not a euphemism, he’s literally going to become a farm dog on my uncles farm).

My brother has a son that was spider-man 2 years ago so I figured we could just use his costume instead of buying another one. When I showed it to my son last week my son was like ""No I want to be the Miles Spider-man from the movie. The black costume!"" 

The costume that my brother gave me was a very high quality costume that cost like $100. I thought he was being unnecessarily picky. I said it was the same thing and that they were both Spider-man. but my son was very adamant that he wanted to specifically be the Spider-man from the  movie ""into the spider-verse"" that came out recently. My wife said I was being dumb and should just  quickly order one from amazon prime since we still had a week. But I thought this was really ridiculous and he was being fussy. I even said he could wear a jean jacket and cargo shorts over the costume so he could like the character did in the movie. 

He eventually said that if he couldn't be in the black costume he didn't want to be spider-man and just went as Darth Vader like he did last year., When he came back he said he saw someone in the costume he wanted to wear and he again was angry.

0,"AITA for disallowing homeless people from sleeping on the property I manage? | I’ve recently been hired to manage a property under construction. 

When the developer bought it it was abandoned in a lower class neighborhood and had been for some time. A few homeless people were living inside the structure, a few more slept there on occasion. 

It’s not even close to being up to code yet, and it’s the owner’s responsibility (really mine, because I was hired to oversee the place) if anyone gets hurt on the property. 

The structure is falling down, there’s a lot of danger on the site, and the construction is making it way less safe, not more, for at least a few more months in these early stages. 

I took some precautions, like putting up “no trespassing” signs and locking the main entrances. But that wasn’t enough, there were still people coming in to sleep and/or treating the place as a dwelling/storage space. 

I came in and explained everyone had to move on because the lot had been sold. But not one person actually left. 

I had to escalate it at that point and hired a security guard and installed some motion alarms. The security guard was instructed to give any trespassers a verbal warning, and if they didn’t leave, to call and have them arrested. 

Within a week I was getting complaints from the surrounding community saying we were “criminalizing poverty” and I should let them stay because they weren’t bothering anyone.

Some background:  Where I work (production) I get 40 hours of vacation and 40 hours of sick leave per year.  Vacations days are easier to reserve way in advance, but can only be used in half or full day increments. Sick time can be used the day of and in hourly increments.

Recently I went to an out-of-state convention.  It was over the weekend so I decided to take off Friday with my vacation time. On Sunday, after it ended, my sister who was a local asked if I wanted to stay another day or two since we don't see each other much. I agreed. 
So I texted work and took off the next two days with my sick time. I've always assumed this was a normal thing to do (admittedly mostly from tv). I don't get sick much, the days expire at the end of my year, and I wanted to save my last vacation time for the holidays.
I thought everything was fine, but the other day I told a parent (who'd been asking about the trip) and they were aghast.

0,"AITA for wanting to wear an specific blazer to prom against my parents will? | Ok so basically I (17F) want to go to my prom with a suit because i think they look super good on women and i deserved it because this year has been rough. I even had a blazer bought 2 years in advance, but my parents hate it with a passion. 
We went to look for cocktail outfits and my mother and I liked some tight pants and a top. I tried it on with my blazer and I liked it, but the trousers seemed off (they were emerald green, the top was white and the blazer was black). We went back home with both things, but I was unconvinced with the trousers. 
We arrive at home and my mother tells that to my father. We see the photos I took with both the blazer and without it. At first, my father tells me that we just need to find an emerald blazer. I even volunteered to pay it with my pocket money, he said it was not about the money.
However, they both started making comments in front of me about how I was looking like a manager if i wore a blazer, along more harsh comments. They laughed in front of me while they were saying that.
I'm quite the self-aware person and seeing the people that are supposed to care about me say those horrible things about how I looked in my dream prom outfit overwhelmed me. I had a breakdown and went to my room. While I was at the room, my mother told something to my father and then he spent all lunch telling me that I only leech money and food off them, and that they weren't going to pay for my college tuition (they know fully well how much i want to go to another college to spend less time with them); suddently it was about the money and they were using it against me ('we paid for the two parts so you don't have anything to say'). I decided to say nothing and stormed to my room as soon as I finished lunch.

I'm used to my parents being volatile and pulling out those manipulative tactics, but now I'm turning 18 in a few months and i feel like this situation is... Wrong.

One thing she does is, after washing, put cutlery back in the drawer without care e.g. fork in the knife area, knife in the little spoon area, etc. Every time I noticed this, I'd fix it and then ask her to put the cutlery in the correct area next time. That didn't occur. She sees it as nagging and told me it ""wasn't a big deal."" I generally reply that being neat is a good habit. For context, I think I'm a somewhat neat person e.g. white pegboard, labelled and shelved garage, dividers in the sock drawer, filing cabinet for important documents and receipts, everything has a place and everything in it's place. She has a folder of all her documents that looks like the wallet of George Costanza.

Anyway, since she moved in some of our things have mixed together with messy results. Her very meagre cutlery set (10ish pieces) is one example. She has her preferred utensils and I use whatever's in the drawer. Having preferred utensils in a mixed scenario generally benefits from nice organisation. However, about 2 weeks ago I got a bit fed up and asked her to please pay attention where to put the cutlery back. Again, I got told ""not a big deal, back off"" so I then asked if it would be a big deal if I removed the dividers entirely. I got a ""do whatever you want"" reply. That was tacit approval in my book.

Time for cutlery anarchy baby! I moved the divider into a labelled box in the garage. Since then she struggles to find her *special* forks and spoons in this metal utensil jungle.

0,"WIBTA if I tell my housekeeper/old nanny to not disrespect me anymore? | I'm 31m, currently working as a lawyer and I live alone with my mother (55f). I moved in about half a year ago when my Dad died (I'm the only child) and started taking over the mortgage payments as well as the utilities such as electricity, gas, etc. This ended up working out for both of us as I still live and work in the city I was born in and was looking to move out of my apartment while she was complaining about living alone. I know it's lame but we both live independent lives outside the house. 

My mom still works as she's a teacher and finds the job fulfilling but I'm bringing home the vast majority of the money. To help take care of the general cleanliness of the house, we decided to hire a housekeeper (my Dad who was retired was the main cleaner of the house). I'll admit that I could have been more involved with the hiring process but my mother took charge and ended up hiring my old nanny (f49). I figured that it was nice to see an old face but the trouble began soon after. For context, I pay the vast majority of her salary although my mother does contribute a small amount.

I feel like she patronizes me all the time - like she doesn't respect me at all. Obviously, this isn't blatant stuff like telling me that I have a bedtime but it's more subtle. Like when I requested that she cook a certain meal (this is part of her duties on certain nights), she continually makes something else entirely. I don't want to be picky/pompous asshole so I end up eating what she makes regardless but I still feel very disrespected (and on the other hand, I feel like the AH here because it does seem like a first world problem). On other incidents, she's basically told me that I shouldn't go out at night with friends because it's too late. The most pressing issue, however, was recently my mother was on an overnight trip with her students. I had invited my girlfriend over (it's a fairly new thing - only about three months) and she spent the night. 

The next morning, when my housekeeper arrived, she basically demanded to know if my mother knew about my girlfriend and that she was currently here. I responded yes, but that it was neither my mother's business or her's anyways who I bring over. She disappeared after that but it was still shocking and made me wonder if I should get my own place again. 

I've thought about telling her to stop disrespecting me and recognize that I'm her boss. On the other hand, I feel a bit like the AH because my mother is genuinely happy with her and apart from similar incidents, she's been a pretty good housekeeper.",False,False,2,3,2,4,1,3,Authority

I admit we are to blame for this. Our eldest wasn’t at all addicted to the screen and didn’t need specific times. It made it harder when we had our daughter and she obviously was. We’ve tried to help her get better at it, but it’s lead to fights. This year she started mirror school and her first report card was less than great. We had been checking her homework but as it turns out, she had been lying to us for awhile about what all of her homework was. 

As a result, we met with her teachers to game plan. She has a planner she must write her homework in and get signed by each teacher, and we check it every day. (The low grades were from not doing the work, not that she didn’t get it). And until her grades are up, no TV. She’s not grounded from anything else, she can go out with friends or use the computer to talk to them. It’s just the TV because it obviously kept coming before school. She was upset at first but then agreed.

Fast forward a week. My son (17) got a movie after work and wanted to watch it. My husband and I agreed. My daughter was getting ready to watch it and I reminded her no TV. She left the room upset. Later she told me this new rule often left her feeling left out as we can all watch TV but she can’t. We do watch TV at night, but if she wants to do other stuff we can.

This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

About a month ago I was a restaurant with my husband of ten years celebrating his promotion at work. About halfway through our meal, a couple was seated at the table next to us. She was wearing a white dress and veil and he was in a suit so it's pretty obvious that they just eloped. They also looked extremely young to be getting married, but that's their choice so I didn't think much of it. My husband congratulated them and they thanked us. They seemed very nice until I couldn't help but overhear the bride say to the groom something along the lines of: ""Hey, do you mind ordering my drink for me?"" 

This struck me as odd as most grown adults wouldn't ask someone else to order for them. The groom nodded and the bride got up to go to the bathroom. While she was in the bathroom, the waitress came and the groom ordered two beers. Something still seeming off to me, so when the bride returned and I asked them how old they were. She is 19 and he is 21. So, she obviously isn't old enough to drink so he's buying it for her. After watching them have a few more drinks, I decided this wasn't right. Call me old fashioned, but I am very against underage drinking as it can do so much damage and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with that. I know people who have ruined their's and other's lives over this and so when I see it happen I do something about it. So, I reported it to the hostess who then came over to ask the bride for her ID. The bride said she didn't have it on her. They went back and forth for about a minute and it ended with the bride admitting she was 19. The hostess then asked them to leave as they don't allow people to drink underage. The hostess was gave me a dirty look and my husband asked if I had said something. When I told him I had, he got pissed off at me and said it was none of my business to say something. I think I did the right thing as the bride shouldn't have been drinking underage and if she really wanted to drink they could've waited a year to get married. Besides, it's incredibly selfish and wrong to scam a restaurant that could also suffer major consequences for this.

1,"AITA for punishing my daughter for wearing incorrect uniform at school? | My daughter goes to a Catholic school. She’s gone there since she was in kindergarten, so her uniform is nothing new. However, this is her first year in the high school portion of the school. The high school admits a lot more students who aren’t necessarily religious, and my daughter got mixed up with some new girls who are bad influences. She’s gotten in trouble at least once a month this school year for improper uniform, like rolling up her skirt so it’s too short, untucking and unbuttoning her shirt, taking off her blazer, wearing too much jewelry or makeup. I make sure she has correct uniform before she leaves for school, but she changes how she wears her uniform when she’s out of my site. 

I’ve gotten sick of the phone calls from school, being forced to pick her up late due to after school detention and being forced to drive her to school on Saturdays for Saturday detention. The last straw was last week when she had two violations in a week. 

This past weekend, I gave her the punishment of having to wear the proper uniform all weekend. We just did our normal routine over the weekend. We ran errands, we went for a walk, we went to church. I even treated her to brunch after church. She didn’t want to go to brunch while wearing the uniform, but I reminded her that this was her punishment for failing to wear the uniform properly at school. I even agreed to let her go to her friend’s house, as long as she wore the uniform, but she ultimately decided not to go since she didn’t want to go out with the uniform anymore. She got a couple of questioning looks while we were out, but nobody really said anything. One woman at church said it was nice to see a teenager so formal at church, which I think embarrassed my daughter, but that was it.  

Today, one of my church friends later asked me why my daughter was in uniform, so I explained the punishment, and she said that the punishment was too harsh and embarrassing. Yes, my daughter was embarrassed, but that was part of the punishment. And it’s not like the outfit is embarrassing in and of itself. She wears this to school every day after all.

0,"AITA for pronouncing French words like I would in French? | Hi Reddit,

Longtime lurker, bear with me please!

Background: I speak French fluently because I went to French school (in the USA, 90% of the curriculum was exclusively in French) from PreK-12th grade. A lot of my friends are French, and to date we still speak in French when we get together(I'm in my late 20s for context). My parents, while not French, live in France, and I visit them at least once a year. I have French extended family. I watch French TV, read in French, and just generally have French stuff happening around me because it has been part of my life since I can remember.

I don't bring this up randomly to people, bc I think that would be kind of douchey to unnecessarily volunteer this info that is irrelevant to my day to day life. However, all my close friends know about my connection to French/France, and laugh at me when I get drunk and can't remember certain words in ENGLISH.

Onto the issue...this past Sunday, I met up with a new(ish) friend for dinner & drinks. Things were going fine, until she asked me what I had done that weekend, to which I replied ""I made crêpes for breakfast yesterday (Saturday)."" I pronounced the word ""crêpes"" the way I learned to say it and the way I routinely say it, which phonetically sounds kinda like ""cr-epp-s."" She proceeded to ask me what those were, and I told her they were French, thin pancakes that you can eat with butter and sugar (like I did) or with more elaborate fillings. 

She then went on to say, oh, do you mean, ""cray-ps?"" (in the typical American pronunciation.) I said yes, exactly! She looked super confused, then weirdly offended, and proceeded to ask me why I felt the ""need"" to sound so ""pretentious"" when talking about them. I replied saying I wasn't being pretentious, I was just pronouncing this food the way a) it is pronounced by the people who routinely make/eat it, b) the way I routinely say it, since I speak French.

So my family is Hindu but I’m a leaning atheist because I just feel the concept of religion is stupid asf. I still am forced to do religious shit for my family because I am afraid of telling them because once I made jokes about being an atheist and I got cussed out by my dad. Although my religion isn’t very strict, one constraint gets me so mad. I can’t eat beef or pork. I know it seems weird to be mad but just understand me please. I love food and I’m very explorative with my tastebuds and am always willing to try new food. Of those new foods involves beef or pork. Because of my religion(Hinduism), I was barred from eating beef or pork. Initially I didn’t care but when I started becoming more of a foodie it became enraging. I tried beef once when I went to a fair with some people for a trip. My whole group wanted burgers so I didn’t want to contest because I was shy to tell them. I got really turned off from veggie burgers because the last few I had were so bad. So I got a regular cheeseburger. I bit into it and the first bite felt like a whole new world of taste. Like I’ve never felt this before. But I was sad since this was one of the few opportunities I got to try it. I had bacon once in Mac and Cheese at a hotel for a band trip and that was amazing too. 

Sometimes however I get cravings for cheeseburgers or steak or bacon and my mood becomes so angry because I can’t satisfy my cravings. It just feels like nothing replaces beef or pork. I try all the general stuff I use to beat cravings like mints and gum but it didn’t work. Whenever I get the opportunity I go grab something beef or pork related and chow down like no tomorrow. I always do it behind their back. Recently even my brother has started doing it because he tried it and loved it.

I told her that I'd still have to think about it, because I can't come up with an answer on the spot. I also told her I need to know the details, to which she said ""like?"" and I told her that's for her to tell me because she's the landlord (details would obviously include prices for rent, internet, gas, water and electricity bills, how much I would chip in for general shopping items, etc). 

Before she told me all that, she decided to tell me her household rules. They included the following: no eating or drinking (unless using a bottle) in the bedroom, no mess in my room, can't go out every night (need to stay home some nights), I can't bring guys home (I can only sometimes), my friends can't come over regularly, I'll need to chip in with her dog cleaning chores, I'll be the driver if we need to go shopping, and I need to cook the meals if we're having the same meal.

After reading that, I was like wtf. I told her I won't be moving in somewhere to be parented, if I want to bring guys home I will, I won't be loud though because I'm considerate that others are in the house. If I want to have a friend over, I don't need to ask, and I can eat whatever I want to, etc etc. She goes to me ""is that how you think it works everywhere?"" To which I said yes. 

I'm a law student, so I sent her some laws that showed what she's asking of me is illegal, as she'll be my legal landlord and having those requirements aren't legal for a landlord to ask. While rules are obvious, every house has them, the general gist of the laws where I live are as long as your not damaging the property, as long as you're paying the rent on time, there's not much else a landlord can require of someone -- they can deny anyone living there for whatever reason, but they can't tell you what you're allowed to do in that space. Sorry if I'm not making sense, I'm tired. It's obviously not the same in every area or country, but that's how it is in the area where I live.

She wasn't impressed, and started to ignore me. But I wasn't having it, that's why I sent her some laws about what she's doing.

1,"AITA For keeping guns in my vehicle that were discovered by my nosey coworkers? | This happened monday, fresh off the weekend and its been annoying me ever since. I am being treated like im in the wrong in this situation so lets see what you guys think.

I drive a 2018 Range Rover with plenty of interior space. As such I keep three guns in my vehicle at all times. I keep a Glock 19 in my glove box, a .38 snubnose in my drivers side door, and a brand new V3 Tac 13 shotgun under the back seat.

I also keep some other weapons and gear under the seats and in the side doors and trunk. I keep these for my own reasons and never bring them inside my office. I live in a metropolitan environment that is not friendly to weapons.

Two workers who I am on good terms with ask me if I would eat lunch with them. I agree. As we're leaving my coworker says he parked on the roof of our parking garage (he arrives late constantly and is unable to park in a desirable spot. This angers me to say the VERY least as he invited me).

They suggest using my Range Rover as it has generous amounts of leg room even with my equipment and is just a nicer vehicle in general.

I agree. One coworker sits in my front passenger seat, the other sits in the back. My coworker compliments my car which I enjoy. However he is very touchy and opens my glove box, revealing my glock 19 as well as my knife, and documents which spill on the floor. I slam the glove box closed and tell him not to touch things in my vehicle.

The ride is mostly silent, until i see my other coworker in the back seat nudge my concealed shotgun with his foot. He also turns his head and looks in my truck and starts asking me about my gear. I keep my camera and emergency roadside tool kit in there, along with some other less than lethal equipment.

He starts asking me about them and i give him the silent treatment for a few minutes before telling him to not look into my trunk.

Lunch was terrible. Overpriced and they couldnt cook a steak properly. As a gesture of good will i pay for said lunch.

I don’t make a living off photography yet but I already do paid shoots almost every weekend for coworkers, friends and family. I want to make a name for myself in this field so I invested in equipment and training, and I always choose carefully the pictures that become part of my portfolio. 

A few weeks ago I went on vacation with my friends. I took hundreds of pictures of them for free, even though I usually get paid for my photos now. I chose ten pictures of each friend which I post processed to reflect the style that I want to be my signature, and sent them those pictures so they can post them in their social media. That way my friends have great pictures to show everyone and I get my name out there as a photographer, which is a win for all of us.

One of my friends got one of her pictures, edited the colors so they’re very different from my style, and used that picture as her profile pic in her social media. I got angry because 1. Even though the picture is of her, she had no right to edit it without my permission because it’s my photo; and 2. The editing is very amateur and not a style that I want to be associated with, so it’s going to affect my reputation in a bad way. 

I called her to tell her to take the picture down and not to edit any of the pictures I provided. She said that she’s sorry but she likes the colors of her edit better and she hopes I can let her use that one photo. I got even angrier because I took a lot of time and effort to develop my editing style for someone to say that filters from tumblr or deviantart are better. I told her that for the last time please take that picture down or I will never take her picture again. She complied. 

Her boyfriend, who is also my friend, called me afterwards and said what I did was assholish because it was just one picture and I had already given those pictures to them for free so I shouldn’t control something as simple as using a different filter. For me though, I’m protecting my reputation and my career which I’ve spent a lot of time and effort to build.

My parents and I live next to a deaf-mute couple who own two dogs. In the past we had no issue with them, but our neighbours have allowed their dogs to bark all day for HOURS ON END. Naturally due to the neighbours' deafness, they cannot hear their dogs barking and it simply continues....

When the issue first occured, we left a note in their mailbox politely explaining that my brother and father work jobs that require them to wake up early in the mornings and the incessant barking was becoming an issue. A week went by and we received no response, yet the barking continued. Eventually my mother contacted the father of the deaf-mute husband and explained the situation, his only response was to laugh and tell my mother ""your husband and son should just use ear plugs or sleep in different rooms"".

My mother decided to contact the local council about the issue. After about two months, the council issued a formal warning. The barking continued....

My mother contacted the father again abd explained our situation, the father explained in an irritated manner that ""the dogs are there to help his deaf-mute son and wife with their daily activities due to their conditiod, and that we should just put up with it"". We were confued, surely there is no need for their dogs to incessantly bark like that though? 

Eventually we sought mediation from the council, and the council ruled that one of the dogs be separated and live at the father's property. The neighbours were not happy but complied for a while.

This brings me to the present. I am starting to get fed up with the fact that the neighbours seem to pay no regard to us or the official warnings issued by the council.

So I took matters into my own hands.

Unhappy with the fact that the father neighbours are so inconsiderate and seemingly thinking that this issue is a big joke by laughing at us whenever they see us, I contacted the father myself this time. I explained to him that the barking has continued for months now despite our complaints, and how his son laughs whenever he sees us, I gave him an ultimatum.

They either adhere to the official orders ruled by the council, or I take the matter to the court. This did not sit well with the father, as he decided to abuse me over the phone calling, my family horrible people, stripping his disabled son and wife of their right to have dogs.

I filed for the court proceeding and the magistrate ruled both dogs off the premises as it was quite clear to her that the dogs were merely pets, rather than aids, as there was no paper-work to prove such a thing.

While we are happy with this outcome, we still cop abuse from the husband and dead-mute neighbours occassionally....

We use programs outside of school hours as part of our school instruction and take every opportunity as learning. On a whole they do much less work than other kids their age so when I tell them to do something I expect it done. 

My 9 year old is obsessed with books called The Magic Treehouse and we went to NYC today so she could see the author and get a picture with her.

Her younger sisters came with us but were not as interested and excited as she was.

She started to pout and stomp during the program that she was not writing and she was drawing a picture. I told her she would regret it and that no matter what she would be doing writing today so please do this project now. She refused and sat there with her arms crossed. 

As I suspected after the writing time they allowed kids to stand up and read their story to Mary Pope Osborne.

Early in the day, my mentor had the idea to play a prank on our last class of the day by pretending they had an essay due. I told her that I didn’t want to, but that she could. I hate April Fool’s day, but I’m not about to rain on anyone’s parade. She decided to do it. 

Last period comes and her prank is funny and easygoing, the kids laugh, I’m finishing some work while it happens, all is well.

I’m then attempting to start the lesson when two girls - who have a long history of fighting - start shouting and squaring up in the back of my class. My teacher runs out saying she’s getting admin, and I try to keep everyone’s attention off the girls. 

She re-enters with a male teacher and they take one of the girls outside. Again, I attempt to start my lesson and the class follows.

As we’re getting into our reading, my mentor bursts through the door and starts screaming at my class, “SHE IS OUT THERE BAWLING. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? I NEED ANSWERS, NOW. KATIE (the other girl), WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?”

I felt completely embarrassed for my mentor, as I felt like this outburst was completely unprofessional. I finally snap and say, “If you need to have that conversation, take her outside. You need to get out. We’re trying to work.” and my mentor takes her outside.

We again try to get on task.

My mentor then comes in with the girls about ten minutes later and the girls say “It was a prank.”

Me: “Okay”

I keep teaching.

The girls: “That’s it?”

Me: “We’ve already wasted over half our class on pranks. I’m not interested in wasting anymore.”

My mentor comes up to me in the English office after class, laughing, and I say “Did you help them plan that?”

Mentor: “No, but I was told to play along.”

Me: “Yeah, well, you’re the teacher. You’re the adult. You should’ve shut it down. I’m so angry that I’m ready to walk out. That was completely disruptive and disrespectful. How was I supposed to know what that was?” 

My mentor got sheepish and apologized, saying that it wasn’t her attention to disrupt things and make me uncomfortable. I can’t help but feel like a giant asshole, but I felt completely helpless. So Reddit, AITA for being so sensitive? ",False,False,3,3,2,4,1,3,Authority

0,"AITA for kicking out an autistic kid from my movie theater? | This one is a little interesting

A little backstory first.

I am a manager (m 19) at a movie theater, in a rougher part of a major Canadian city.

While cleaning a theater to prepare it for the next showing, a 16 year old looking kid came into the theater trying to find his hat. No problem, stuff gets lost all the time, and I know exactly where to look; (stuff almost always finds its way under the seats). The whole time we were looking, he was cussing under his breath, ""son of a bitch"" ""fuck me,"" to me it seemed a little excessive but i understand people get frustrated when they lose things. I would expect this reaction if someone had lost their phone, but he had only lost his hat. Anyways I find his hat (under the seat), he takes it, says thanks, and goes on his way. The hat was a black hat with a Dos Equis logo on it. After he leaves, I think to myself ""wow that interaction was weird,"" and go on with my day without thinking anything of it. 

fast forward about an hour

i was at box office when a guest informed me there was a disturbance by the vending machines. I thank her for informing me and start heading over there. Immediately I see a man throwing punches at another individual. I intervene and tell the man to leave now. He turns around (he appears to be a teenager) and very smugly chuckles and says ""oh thats my mom."" I say ""doesnt matter, you need to leave now."" To me it seemed like he thought he could get away with doing whatever he wanted to his mom, judging on his response. regardless, I was going to kick him out no matter what his response was. He requested to leave out of the front doors, which I thought was an odd request considering what had just happened. I said no and escorted him out of the side doors. He kicks the door on the way out.

I go to check up on the mom, she is okay but has tears in her eyes. Behind her is her younger son who was holding onto his eye and crying (he had gotten a black eye from his older brother). I ask if she is okay, she says yes, she says that her son is autistic and is 16 but has the mental capacity of an 8 year old. That explains it. She was completely silent from when i approached the situation, until I asked if she was okay, she had not said anything while I was kicking the kid out. Regardless, we give her a refund, a few passes and send her on her way (this took about 10 minutes from the time i asked her if she was okay). I apologized for kicking him out, saying that when I saw violence i had to act. She says not to worry.

After a few minutes I realized the kid was the same kid who lost his hat (i had recognized the hat). this explained his behavior to me. 

Fast forward about an hour, I was coming back from break.

As I walk in the doors, a fellow manager says to me that the cops are here, looking for someone. (he shows me a picture of the individual). its the kid. fuck. 

I go up to the cops, they asked for my story, I told them i saw someone throwing punches and kicked him out. They said he was autistic. I told them the mom told me until thereafter. They said not to worry, but that he had gone missing. 

Turns out that when i kicked him out he kinda just kept walking instead of waiting for his mom or whatever, and again, this is in a rough neighborhood. 

So am I an asshole for kicking out an autistic kid, leading to him going missing? I feel like perhaps I should have waited and asked the mom before kicking him out, but she never said anything while i was doing it. I have no idea what happened to this kid, and I feel really bad that my actions led him to going missing. Then again, I also feel justified in this situation because the dude was beating the shit out of his family, what else could I have done.

A few years ago I was attending a community college. I also worked there, work-study, as a tutor. 2 days a week I sat in on the class I tutored for and helped students. 

I want to emphasize here that I was not a teachers assistant. I was told, explicitly, that I was just there to answer student questions during their free-work time, since it was a large class. 

One day I got to the class and the teacher wasn't there. Students come, we all sit and wait... and wait... 35 minutes later (it was a 2 hour class) the teacher still wasn't there. I let the students go and go home myself. About an hour after that I got an email from the teacher, telling me how disappointed he is with me, how irresponsible it was to not keep the class there, and that he had been working with another student in his office and lost track of time, why didn't I come get him?

The next day I met with him to apologize and explain that I had, in fact, looked for him but I didn't know where his office was and the main office was closed because of the time. He basically said whatever, don't let it happen again and we moved on. 

So I kinda feel like it's not my job to hunt down the teacher for his class, and I already kept the students longer than strictly necessary. Was I the asshole, though?

So, this week, I planted a 20 dollar bill before my daughter took her lunch money out. Sure enough, she took it.

I called the police and asked them to come with me to the school so that we could teach my daughter a lesson. Two officers met me there and we pulled my daughter out of class, after which she informed one of the officers that there has been a bully who is stealing her lunch money/forcing my daughter to buy her lunch.  She also has been buying lunch for one of her friends who can not afford it. This was confirmed by both the bully, and the friend.

My daughter was silent on the way home and i informed her that I was just trying to teach her a lesson, that stealing is wrong and can get you in a lot of trouble. and that in the future she needs to speak to myself or her mother if there are issues at school and we would be happy to help her resolve them.

I’m naturally a tightly wound person, and I tend to overthink things and be overly cautious about how I’m affecting others. All this said - when I smoke I use the backyard. I’m not worried about bothering my roomates or landlord; rather a daycare ran out a house somewhere up the block on the adjoining street. I really cant tell the distance, but I know it’s at least two yards over and two ‘up’ from ours. I often find myself getting ready to smoke, walking outside and hearing the kids playing in the yard. I’m not sure if I’m just guilt/shame/paranoia trippin’ myself or if I should really feel bad or go back inside if I hear that the kids are outside.

Some more facts:  
The daycare isn’t listed on google maps so I don’t know exactly how far it is. The kids are always screaming, so it seems like it could be close or quite far, I’m tired of listening to hear if they’ve gone inside yet. It just messes up the flow of when I get myself excited to get home, smoke, clean up, change etc.

He had to go to school and work part time in a clothes factory(sweeping and stuff) and I never took his money. And he had to get good grades and apply for a program where he attends college courses while I high school.

He is naturally good looking (the best out of all of us just a fatass) and we let him know it but he still complained. So I told him ""do something about it first then complain"". I took him running every morning  (it was exhausting for me to take him running as well as get home from working overtime and still have to check his homework).

him: ""i cant talk to girls cause they just see me as a fat dude AMD dont even want to look at me""

me: ""change into your sweatpants and meet me outside in 5 mins ""

I say that if this is true, then Megan will be going home and not spending the weekend here. The girls look smug. I then say “Oh, and because she’s clearly dishonest and not living up to the Girl Scout law, I’m going to have to boot her out of the troop.”

That got one of the girls looking upset and I knew my gut feeling was right. Suddenly, she was whispering to Sasha and I asked what was up. She said that it was all Sasha’s idea to get Megan in trouble, because there were too many “babies” on the trip. They had plans for the other four 9-year olds (that wouldn’t have worked). Sasha eventually owned up to it.

I called these girls parents and had them picked up early. I told the girls’ parents that they would not participate in any more GS events for the rest of the schoolyear (last two weeks).

1,"AITA if I report my manager for overdoing holiday decorations in the cubicle space? | I just started this new job back in September.  It's probably the best paying job I've ever had and it's been going fairly well.  At the moment, I wish there was more work to do but we're going into the holiday season so that seems to be impacting the amount of work available.  There's three of us on the team currently, with one vacancy.  There's myself, my team lead and the manager.  For the most part, I enjoy my co-workers and find their personality quirks to be rather charming.  

Anyway, apparently the manager loves to decorate the cubicle area for Christmas, in fact there's an office-wide competition which I didn't know about. At my office, we are sectioned into an area with four adjoining cubicles, no barriers in between the immediate cubicles.  The manager comes in later so she decorates after me and the team lead leave for the day.  

Each morning I come in there's another layer of decor - there's a full-sized Christmas tree that blocks one of the cubicles (but no one uses that one) and a fake wooden chimney that blocks one of the computers that we're all supposed to use on a daily basis, now there's Christmas lights that dangle from the ceiling and reach all the way to our desks (I'm guessing they dangle four feet down from ceiling to desk).  I have lights dangling on my monitors and the overhead cabinets for storing office supplies.  Bleeding out into the hall is a full-sized cardboard moose, presents, fake clouds, snow, cardboard Christmas trees and a cardboard Christmas cabin with Santa.  Needless to say, it's getting a little ridiculous and for me completely unprofessional.  

I know that it's fun to decorate for the holidays but this is also a professional office!  I'm trying to not be an Ebeneezer Scrooge but seeing twinkle lights all around my monitors is grating on my nerves.  Anyway, I'm not sure what to do as this is a manager doing it and she's been here for a long time and is apparently legendary for her ""over-the-top"" holiday decorations.  I've made comments to her about how this seems a bit much but she just laughs it off.  My team lead just shrugs it off when I ask him about it.  Other employees from other teams constantly drop by and say that it seems a bit much as well albeit jokingly.

My mom is 50 and in the best shape of her life. In that past 2 years she has lost over a hundred pounds. She loves going to the gym and physical fitness is her new thing. Since then, she has developed a real nasty and embarrassing habit of snickering little comments about overweight people. Nobody has ever heard her say something but when she says them to me I get super annoyed. She has said things around my girlfriend and I. I have apologized to my girlfriend for it and tried to talk to my mom about how bothersome it is. Now my mom still makes her comments, but follows it with an oof I’m sorry or something like that. 

The other day my girlfriend was over and we were watching tv while my mom was in the kitchen. An ad featuring pop star Lizzo came on the screen and my mom made a comment how she is a “fucking fat shit and a terrible role model for women because she promotes being unhealthy and if she wanted to make an impact she should lose weight and encourage others to do so. My girlfriend, for the first time ever, called my mom completely ridiculous and how Other people look is not her business. She knows how my mom lost a bunch of weight, and made a comment about how just because she didn’t feel attractive when she was big doesn’t mean nobody does. My mom went upstairs after telling me that I have a problem. I told my girlfriend she should just apologize and she said no and went home. 
My mom than started yelling at me about my girlfriend saying she had no right to yell at her, and even if she is being mean that she is my mom and no “little punk” I’m dating has any right to yell at her. She then went on this 5 minute long tangent on how my generation has no idea how to respect their elders blah blah. 

I texted my girlfriend and told her that it’s still my mom and she had no right to yell at her. Like I don’t particularly agree with everything her parents say but I wouldn’t yell at them because they are her parents.

Several days ago I was included on one of those email threads with many recipients and emails popping up at the speed of light.

It soon became clear to me by Bethany's instructions and replies that the project in question was in chaos and heading for the dumpster.

Shortly after the call I received another call from my business partner informing me that Bethany was in tears and claimed that I had been ""mean and aggressive"" with her.  Perhaps we define aggressive differently but I can say in complete honesty that in a lengthy career I've never been called that before.

0,"AITA for not letting my stepson’s mother see him while my husband is out of town? | 
My husband was married before me. His ex-wife announced to him that she had been having an affair and was running off with the guy. She signed away her rights to their kid (7 at the time) and basically said she didn’t want to see either of them again. We started dating after that and got married. It’s been nearly 5 years and we haven’t heard from her. 

My husband and I talked about her a little bit when we first got married. He said he didn’t really think we’d ever see her again, but at the time he was pretty angry with her for what she’s done to their son, so he said if they ever did see her, he didn’t want to see her. But again, that was about 4 years ago when it was still pretty fresh. He said he wasn’t mad for him and he thought that both he and his son were better off without her but he didn’t understand what kind of person would abandon her son like that and he didn’t want that kind of person around his son. But we didn’t really talk about it after. 

My husband doesn’t travel very often for work, but once a year, he goes to France for two weeks. I talk to him every day, but only about 3:00 in the afternoon (time here) because of the time difference. He works long hours and goes to bed pretty quickly afterwards, but he always calls me before he does.  Yesterday, his ex called at about 5:00 our time (12:00 in France) and told me that she had tried to call my husband but he didn’t answer because he was asleep. She got my number from her parents who still have a decent relationship with their grandson, so I have their numbers so they can see him. 

So anyway, she told me she’s going to be in town just for tonight and she was wondering if she could see her son. She said she would have called sooner but it was a last minute trip and it took her a little bit to work her way up to calling because she knew she’d made a mistake and she wasn’t sure we’d want to see her. I told her that I didn’t think my husband would like that very much and since he was out of town, I thought it would be best if she waited until he got back. I told her I would try to call him and ask, but he didn’t answer me either, so I called her back and told her to call back the next time she was in town. I told her I would talk to my husband and see what he thought when he was back in town but she said she wouldn’t be back for a while. 

I’m planning on asking my husband about it tomorrow when I talk to him, but she was pretty upset about it and said that she’s sure he would let her see her son and it was rude of me to not let her see him just based on something he had said four years ago. She said that I should have just as much right to decide who my son sees because I was in charge of him too and so since my husband was unreachable, I got to make the decision.

I don't drive him often (we're both adults and neither of us live at home/with each other), but when I do, it crops up, especially if he's in a bad mood for whatever reason.

She's an atheist and honestly I couldn't care less. I'm not too religious either and religion rarely comes. I don't really want to ""convert her"" or anything like that and we've already agreed to just let our kids choose whatever they want.

Anyways, we're visiting my grandparents in India and I wanted to go around and see some famous temples. I took her to a few, but there's on major temple left. I don't want to specify which one for privacy reasons but from the way I'm describing it I don't think it'll be too hard to figure out which one. Anyways, this temple only allows Orthodox Hindus entry. I've always wanted to visit it.

An argument started between me and her because she says that she wanted to go too. I explained to her that this wasn't possible because she was not a Hindu. She said she could ""pretend"" to be a Hindu for a short while but I told her I would not be comfortable with that as it is against the temple's rules. The place is meant for spiritual connection and she just wants to see the architecture. She got pretty mad and went on a rant about religion before ""giving in"" and saying that if she couldn't go I shouldn't either.

I think this is ridiculous. I've always wanted to go to this temple and I'm allowed entry. She just wants to ""admire the architecture"", which is fine for most temples, and she's gone to plenty with me already, but for a temple which explicitly bars her from going she should follow the rules.

0,"AITA for this argument about studying and video games? | My parents and I have been having an argument. My parents sat me down and asked me about my grades. I told them all the ones that I know. Some of my teachers don't post the grades to Google Classroom so I don't know what some of them are. I have 4 confirmed a's (3 are above 95%) and 3 b's. I'm in 8th grade. Right now I get 2 30 minute sections of game time per day after I do school, homework, and the extra 1hr of math that my mom tells me to do. Our school has a placement test for high school that helps the teachers decide what math class to put us in. I ***chose*** to be put into the 'lower' (i don't know a better word) math class. I've been not doing as good as my parents want me to in math. This happened during the grade conversation. My parents after hearing that I chose to be put into that math class got very mad that I didn't want to go the the higher math.

About an hour after I told them the grades that I know and that I was going to the 'lower math', they told me to study more. I've been studying more, about 2-3 hours each day+studying during classes. They cut my video game time down to 1 30 minutes after they have checked to see if I've done all my homework. I got mad and asked them why, and my mom said, ""We are done talking about this."" After that I went and studied math for an extra hour to try to make them happy. They are still mad at me for having the grades that I have atm. I'm studying more, but they don't seem to see it.

After ten minutes, he laughed and told me to stop acting like a baby. This tipped me over the edge and I stood up, telling him to shut his mouth for once. I yelled everything at him, all the specific times I could remember of him mentally abusing me. I told him that he couldn't get it through his thick skull that I was hurt by him. He went around the table and grabbed my arm, he raised his hand and treated to hit me. I told him to do it, and see what happens. Instead, he shoved me back and as I was walking away, trying to diffuse the situation he muttered that I was a mistake.

The conversation of marriage came up, something I know I'm not ready for just yet, and I said I don't want to change my last name. I like my last name, it's unique and connects me to family I have in another country, plus I've already started publishing some work under it and want to keep everything together. Not only that but the amount of work that goes into changing your name is insane.

When I said this he got really mad and said he would not have a wife or children with a different last name as him. This shocked me but I remained firm in not changing it, I even told him that if it bothered him he could change his last name. I know it's not common, but one of my uncles changed his for my aunt when they married. Well, this ended up with more yelling grom him. He kept saying that I have to change mine as I'm the woman and therefore the one who has to change my last name.

I left his place in tears because he was saying all these horrible things and now, three days later, he hasn't talked to me.

0,"AITA for getting my roomate's boyfriend kicked out and am forcing them to keep thier cat in thier room? | I moved into a shared student apartment a week ago. As our lease says, the rooms are single occupancy and animals are not to be kept in the common areas so I know I'm in the 'right', I just want to know if what I did was a dick move. It is also a female-only apartment.

I live with international students (relevant because of communication issues) who all know each other. At the time this all happened I only guessed they knew each other since it was hard to talk to them. At first, everything was ok. My roommates were clean, quiet and seemed nice enough. We didn't talk at all but that's to be expected with cultural and language barriers. It was hard to talk with them but I'm sure that went both ways.  Then, 2 days ago I went to leave the apartment and saw a ton of boxes and a guy in the house. All my roommates were hanging out in the living room talking, w/e. I assumed he was just a friend helping one move in. Later that night I heard hissing under my door. I left to check it out and realized that they had left their cat in the common area. This wouldn't normally be a big issue but I have a cat in my room (why I choose this unit since it was animal-friendly) who was hiding in my closet to avoid the hissing cat. This cat then spent the next two days hissing at me and the cat in my room. I was also worried because there are now claw marks on the couches in the common area which I would also be liable for since I also have a cat.

That night I was kept up by male voice until 3 am. That morning I saw the guy in the kitchen and was going to try to figure out what was going on with him and the cat. I said hello and he literally said nothing and walked right past me into the bedroom. I was overtired, feeling ostracized like I didn't even live there and a little panicky (I specifically chose a female-only suit over co-ed because living with guys I don't know makes me very panicky) so I immediately contacted the management.  Management sent out a letter and the next day the guy comes up to me and confirm that he lives with his girlfriend, that the cat is a 'shared' cat and that no one else cares that he is there or the cat is there. Well, I care and I told him that I have as much right as any other person (ie his friends) about what happens int eh common area. I then told the manager what he said and she got the ball rolling to have him forcibly kicked out next week.

0,"AITA for wanting to turn of location tracking services my parents use after I leave for college? | So my parents use the iPhone service find my friends to follow my location when they “feel worried” about me which as it is kind of bugs me. The service is similar to Life360 but just gives location updates. They also have me text when I’m leaving and when I’m arriving anywhere, which is quite honestly a drag when I’m with friends but it is what it is. For background I’m a 17 year old high school senior with straight A’s and also take a couple college courses (at my parents request) on the side. I will also be turning 18 before I go away for college. My parents claim they only use the service when they feel worried about my and my 20 year old sister’s safety. For my sister, my mom says she only checks the location at night when she is walking back to her dorm or is out doing something. It amazes me that she is okay with this.

At this time, I allow the service because I am not an adult and have little to no pull on them (ie when I had to argue with them for years about my 9 o’clock bedtime until they finally removed it this year), however I told them that once I go to college, I will be turning off the service on my phone. This was met with a very negative reaction. My parents argue that if I have nothing to hide, what’s the harm. They also argue that if I’m somewhere and I need help, how will they know where to send police. Their evidence for this is the countless hazing cases in frat culture, which I have no intention of joining.

To me however, I view this app as 24/7 stalking and a violation of privacy. This app is absolutely ludicrous and makes me feel very uncomfortable, not because I plan on doing anything illegal or dangerous, but simply because I don’t want to followed and monitored because it not only degrading me to the status of child, but also shows that my parents don’t trust me. Furthermore, it comes off to me that my parents are being control freaks who are not willing to respect my boundaries. In case it is important, when we last had this argument, they said if I didn’t keep the service enabled on my phone then they will be cutting me off, to which I replied that was counter intuitive, as it would prevent me from calling them for help in the event that I actually needed it.

Some extra information in case it is needed:
-the college I plan on attending is about 3 hours away
-I am a straight A student
-I have zero history of risky behavior(drinking, drugs, smoking/vaping)

1,"AITA for wearing a skimpy bikini to my husband's company's summer pool party? | Alright, so the party was yesterday.

He works for a tech startup, it's doing well and has around 80 employees. It's a very informal place, they've got beer on tap in the office, it's got a lot of female employees. Very liberal place.

So the party was also a very informal event, they wanted a big bash for raising their Series B funding, so they hired a DJ, rented out an awsome venue, lots and lots of alcohol.

They were also told to bring friends, as many as they liked.

&#x200B;

Anyway, from everything they described, it seemed like it was going to be wild. So I asked my husband, if I could sort of wear a similar outfit to what I usually wear at festivals.

It's a very cheeky bikini bottom, bikini top, fishnet jeweled top, hat, colored sunglasses, stockings. Very cool and not too inappropriate since I figured a big party that's expecting \~500 people under 35,with one of the biggest DJ's, would have many women dressed like this.

&#x200B;

Apparently, though the dress code stated beachwear, most people were in casual clothes and I was one of maybe 30-50 women baring midriff, and the only one showing booty. My husband didn't mind and was proud, introduced to me to everyone, including his boss etc.

&#x200B;

However, today he got an email from lady in HR saying, while they applaud my confidence, they'd rather I tone it down at a company-sponsored event where the media and investors were.

What probably made it worse for him and well me, was that my husband is best friends with the company's CTO and we hung out with him all evening and night. However, many many investors and other important folks came to meet with him and would have seen me hanging out in their group.

&#x200B;

My husband, isn't feeling bad, he's handling it well. He replied, saying that his wife (me) is accustomed to wearing this attire at pool parties and was sort of led to believe (by him) that was going to be a big summer bash given the DJ, venue and hype. He apologized and said he'd rather she tell him upfront so that I could have gone home to change or cover up with something so that it would have limited any embarrassment.

It was my choice to wear this, and I do feel awful, but I don't think I was wrong or an asshole to wear what I did. They told everyone bring friends, it's going to wet and wild etc. It's a startup not a Fortune 500 company.

Now there are a lot of unspoken rules. Certain things have to be in certain places, even if there's no obvious reason for it, that sort of thing. We tell every new hiree about all of the rules and I make sure they know they can always ask if they need help with something.

Recently, we started to notice certain things misplaced. We had a short meeting with all of the staff and I tried to get them to admit who it was. Not to punish them, but to explain why it had to be the other way. No one admited, which was fairly disappointing, but whatever. I explained the reason anyway, but we continued to find things in places they shouldn't be. I planned on setting up a meet with each of our staff individualy, hoping to resolve the issue.

Yesterday, Kate came to because she couldn't find a crate of quite expensive wine (think $150/bottle). I told her to look where the wine would usually be, but it wasn't there. That's when she said she put the crate elsewhere the day before, because she tought it would be more accesible there, but that it isn't there anymore. I asked her where she put it and basically she put it where we put empty wine/alcohol bottles at the end of shifts (she didn't know this, because only me and another guy take out the empty bottles as we stay longer than everyone else).

Now me and my boss reviewed the footage and indeed, it showed her putting the wine there and 6 hours later, me and the other guy, collecting all the crates and taking them out (we stack them on a cart, so we didn't even notice the crate was heavy.

Now he wants her to pay $1500 out of pocket for the 10 bottles. She asked me to talk to him and explain that she didn't mean to do it. I told her I was sorry, but we had told every single staff member where things have to be placed and she still did it her own way, therefore I couldn't do anything to help her.

This spot is fenced off and says no trespassing; only residents can enter and throw away trash. There is this woman who comes frequently and will drive to the different buildings in the community and dumpster dive. I originally guessed this is what I was doing when I entered the garage to park and saw her headfirst in a trash bin. After seeing her a few times I decided to approach her and ask if she lived here. The first time I asked her she said she was visited her daughter but had no idea which unit she was in or anything. Obviously didn’t live in the area.

I do the accounting at a construction site and my partner does construction work, my work is 8-4.

We have a live in childminder, she's 22 and she's great  (was?)

Her jobs were;  let the horse out, change horses water, walk the dogs, give children breakfast, get youngest ready, feed the dogs and clean up after them, look after youngest, walk and feed dogs, clean up after the horse and put the horse away.

I'm aware it's quite a bit but the pay was £17 an hour, a fair price since I provided her utilities and food.

I've noticed a preference to my daughter (6) which was frustrating, she bought my eldest presents too.

She was great, both children absolutely adored her but she got too connected, she spoke nonstop about my children and would buy them presents etc.

I genuinely believe she viewed them as her children.

I fired her because she was too attached to the children.

0,"AITA for snapping at my neighbor when she kept telling me how to raise my dog? | Alright, now that I read the title, it sounds pretty bad, but let me explain. My family has a dog who’s six months old and pretty small, think cocker spaniel. He’s a puppy, so he’s jumpy, but whenever we meet people we make sure we can hold him back and he has gotten much better at greeting people. My neighbor, who lives downstairs, has two cats. Of course, whenever the pup meets her he smells the cats and gets all jumpy. We restrain him and apologize every time, usually he doesn’t even jump on her because we grab him. We’re always extremely apologetic about his behavior to her, and make it known that she can tell us if his barking gets too loud. 

Today I was taking him out for a walk as my designated teen duties (I’m 15) and we encounter the neighbor in the tiny lobby space. It’s less than 5x5, so not even much space for two. Of course the dog goes crazy, and I grab him to make sure he doesn’t jump. This is where my neighbor, who’s never owned a dog in her life, decides to teach me how to handle the pup. 

She grabs him, already setting me on edge, and tries to sit him down on the ground. The pup, thinking it’s time to play with this new person, only jumps up more. Then the neighbor begins to go on about how “yeah, this is how it’s done, you have to do it like this.” And telling me that we need to get him into obedience school ASAP. I’m polite, laughing and saying how jumpy he is and sort of agreeing with her. 

I try and leave, saying he needs his walk, but apparently I haven’t gotten her message. She just keeps going on and making these passive aggressive little comments about the dog all while pretty much holding him down. Eventually, I have enough and tell her, 

“Can you please not grab him, it’s making him more jumpy, and we’ll get him in obedience school as soon as the schools open up again, along with everything else.” 

And then leave to go on the walk. She then told my parents about the way I talked to her, but they know she’s like this so swayed more to my side, but told me to not go off on her like that. 

Yes, I know I could’ve been more polite, and I should’ve just left. I also have the suspicion that she doesn’t like the dog much because of the occasional barking, but she always says she can’t hear it?

she has a feud with an older couple. its been going on for years and she thinks they contaminate the house with poison, so she holds the door up for hours & end, even in the winters. she also harrassess them by the entrance, and she and the other people scream at each other at all hours, even past midnight/2-5 am. my friend couldnt even sleep at my place because of the constant noises.

i collect guitars and have some old wood furniture, and the moisture on the summer and the cold in winter really ruins those things, as they are made of wood. i have to leave my guitars in the shop often, because the wood warps and makes it hard to play, so she has cost me money too.

she also insists on talking to me, but she creeps me out, she looks creepy too. im getting sick of her, and her yelling and her noises, and she also brings druggies or at least weird people in to the house, they usually sit in the entrance, not her apartment.

the last straw came when i fixed an old guitar from my dads. i spent a month fixing everything, then it got really warm and damp outside and this woman let in all the moisture by holding the door open. since the guitar is old, the wood was fragile, and some parts popped out, or in general got messed up, so now i have to spend maybe 80 euros again, when thought I was done.

0,"AITA for taking the belongings of a couple homeless men? | Backstory is a must so please hear me out. I work for a commercial real-estate company in Milwaukee as a maintenance man. I handle over 3 million square feet of property (mostly very old) along with my supervisor. One of our buildings has recently become vacant due to the previous tenant moving. Over the past few months we have had serious criminal damage done to the property resulting in a lot of calls to the local PD and beefed up security (cameras and barbed wire fence). 

About 2 weeks ago I make my bi-weekly lap around the building looking for more damage and checking cameras. To my delight I find nothing, at first. As I get to the back of the building where the railroad is, I notice a lot of new garbage. Mostly cheap beer and liquor bottles along with McDonald's wrappers flying around. I walk to where one of the service doors was spray painted and find a pile of blankets and more garbage.

It took me a second but I realized there was a person under the blanket. I wake the guy up and ask him if everything is alright. He goes on to say he's just trying to stay warm from the winter weather pushing in and he thought this spot was well enough out of the way as to not be bothered. I say not a problem, just so long as you clean up the garbage I'm fine with you staying here. I told him about the kids tearing the place apart and advised him not to stick around during the day, less the police or my boss find someone at ""the scene of the crime"" so to speak. He said no worries I'll clean up and be on my way. I think nothing more of it and go about my day.

A week later I do my walkthrough and what do I find but the same garbage, plus more, and someone else sleeping in the same spot. I wake him up and ask about the beer cans scattered around. He says none of it is his even though I see amongst his belongings are 3 more unopened beers of the same type. Slightly annoyed, I explain to this guy the exact same thing I told the other man. You can stay, please clean up. He says no problem I'll do it before I leave. I say thank you, and ask him if he knows the other guy that sleeps here. He nods and I ask him to remind him about cleaning up.

Two days later I come back to more garbage. Now I'm upset. When our buildings accrue an excess of garbage the city will give us a warning and then begin to fine us. I find the second guy and give him one last chance. I tell him to clean up or next time I'm going to have to involve the police. I find the first guy sleeping under a loading dock and explain the same. I told both of them I don't want to call the police but I can't just let you continue to stay here making a mess. Going on to state how if my boss found out I was giving them a second chance let alone a third, how I would be fired. Again the agree to clean up, so I leave.

Today I find neither of them, but the garbage and their personal items are still there. So as promised I call the non-emergency number and explain to them the situation. I ask them if there is anything they can do and they say it's out of their hands unless damage is being done. The tell me that I am allowed to remove the garbage/items. I wait around the building for an hour hoping to spot one of the homeless men, but nothing. It's at this point I make the decision to move all of the stuff inside our building. I came back to that building 3 more times throughout the day hoping to find one of them and return the items on the condition they don't come back.

I didn't see either of them, however their items are safe and I do plan on returning first thing in the morning. I feel terrible for taking their things but I can't risk my job.

1,"AITA for arguing with my vegan sister about eggplant parmesan? | I (28M) work as a chef, and admittedly I didn't/don't have a lot of experience with vegetarian and vegan cooking because my training didn't teach much of that and my restaurant doesn't have vegan options. However one thing that WAS involved in my training was eggplant parmesan, which my sister (21) decided to make for her and my mom for Valentine's weekend.

I was curious as to how she was doing an eggplant parmesan if she can't eat dairy so I questioned her about it. She said she was using a blend of vegan mozzarella and parmesan style cheeses and wasn't breading the eggplant because they actually don't traditionally bread the eggplant in Italy. I kind laughed because - 'hey I don't think that's true about the breading, but even if so, the Italians use real cheese, not vegan cheese. It's not really eggplant parmesan you're making.' She just said 'Well sorry for being vegan and lactose intolerant. You're not eating it or making it so I actually don't care for your opinion.""

I thought that was a bit harsh and I reminded her I am a chef so it's not like I don't know what I'm doing. She said she's not eaten dairy in 3 years and meat in 2 so she knows better than me about vegan cooking. I told her I'm sure I could easily make a vegan meal, and she asked why I never have then, even though she knows I cook so much at work I don't like to cook at home often.

She then turned to me and said just because I'm a chef doesn't mean I'm the only one in the family who knows how to cook. She said just because she's 3/4 through an accounting degree doesn't mean she's going to argue with our dad about how he should do his taxes. 

Then at dinner, my dad and I had something different from my mom and sister so we could have meat, and my sister wouldn't even let me try any of the eggplant 'parmesan' though she offered some to dad.

1,"AITA for ""publicly slut shaming"" one of my coworkers for her inappropriate outfits? | I am a female teacher who has taught at an all boys school for what will be twenty-eight years at the end of this year. There are only a handful of other women who teach here and the majority of us are in our 50s-60s. The other younger two are both obese. So for the most part, inappropriate attention from students really isn't an issue- I know that sounds weird but it's something you have to look out for. You have to watch how you interact with students, how you dress, etc. 

This past fall, for the first time in five years, a new female teacher joined us. I'll call her J. J is 27, fresh out of college and very beautiful. However, she dresses very inappropriately for work: short dresses (above the knee), tight pants/skirts, low cut shirts, etc. It's not shockingly provocative, but it's obviously inappropriate for work. At first, some of the cattier women at work immediately jumped on her and constantly began making rude remarks towards her. I figured they were just jealous, so I took it upon myself to befriend her. I also figured someone would eventually speak to her about her outfits, so I kept my mouth shut. However, a the semester went on, her outfits got increasingly more provocative, so much that we all noticed.  And of course with this came more snarky comments from coworkers and students beginning to talk. 

I ended privately speaking with my boss, M, about the way J dresses. M is not a subtle guy and does not usually take people's feelings into consideration so when I spoke with him I made sure to explain that this was something that should be handled privately and delicately. He seemed like he understood but the next day during lunch when we were all on the same lunch break, M proceeded to tell J in front of everyone how inappropriate she was dressing and that it reflected poorly on our school. J left in tears. When it came out (and I don't how it did, but it did) that I was the one that reported her, all the female teachers accused me of slut shaming J because I was jealous of her. I found this sort of funny given how they had been treating her. The male teachers seem to be on my side, however. It's completely split between guys and girls.

I don't whether or not this was the right way to have handled this- it was the most professional way I could think of. It was not my intention to embarrass J but I did feel that her dressing the way she has wasn't appropriate for school- especially being around teenage boys all day. That being said, I ended up humiliating her in front of all of her coworkers. But I had the schools' intentions in mind so I don't feel that I owe anyone an apology. AITA?

I'm a homeschooled senior, but I still have an online full-time course load, with band practice, gym, and flying lessons (which I'm pursuing as a career) on top of that, and I really don't have any free time during the week. From their point of view, they see me on my computer for 6-8 hours a day, and associate it with me goofing off/gaming. Because of this, they've always piled my schedule up with a ton of extracurricular activities, which made me absolutely miserable. (This contributed to a hospitalization for personal reasons in 2015, when I was 15.)

The problem I'm having is that they want me to get one right now, just to completely fill me schedule. 

They know that I am going to be working full time this summer, and that I want to get said job. I've tried talking to them about letting me finish up school, which are going to be wrapping up in 3 months, but they constantly say that my schedule needs to be completely filled. They constantly talk about how they when they were younger, they had both school and jobs, and they were completely fine, but from my point of view, I'm not them, and I can't really tolerate that kind of 24/7 schedule.

Over the past week, we've been fighting a lot over this. Anytime I try and talk to them about it, they pretend to be understanding, but then completely ignore anything I'm saying, and our conversations go nowhere. They constantly say that if I don't get a job, they're going to kick me out, (I'm 18, they can.), which will prevent me from going to college this fall due to being homeschooled.

Background: I work for the federal government and have a high security clearance. I am not undercover or anything like that and who I work for is public knowledge, but what I work on is secret. 

A person I went to high school with has made their career as an adult film star. While I have never seen them on the front page of Pronhub, I know they are pretty well known in the adult film industry. We were sort of in the same friend group in high school and have been... sort of friendly since then. We text every so often and over the years have gotten drinks with friends when we have both been in our home town.

Recently, this person reached out to me and expressed interest in working for the government in a capacity that would require a high-level security clearance. I told them to send me their resume and we could talk about it. Their resume consisted of BA in film and all the adult movies they had been in and that's it. Being an adult film star isn't necessarily disqualifying someone from a job for the federal government, but it's going to be an uphill battle against people with qualifications more inline with the position. 

We had a phone conversation where I explained how to gain job experience to become a more appealing candidate. Finally, we went through some of the stander questions that would be asked during an interview. I asked pretty standard questions including drug use. They failed pretty much every question I asked about their drug use. I explained that if they stopped using drugs from the last time they used them on, they would age out of being eligible for the position before the required time had passed for not using drugs. 

They then asked me if I would be a professional reference when they applied to which I said no because we never worked together. They then asked if I would be a personal reference and write them a letter of recommendation. Personally and professionally I couldn't recommend someone for the position they were applying for with their drug use history. 

I told them point-blank that because of their drug use that they were unhirable for any security clearance and they should strongly consider a new career path. They didn't take this well and after a short exchange they hung up on me.

Both of my daughters dispise each other. They've gone to therapy for almost a year now and nothing has changed. They argue about everything. 

They were arguing last month when my husband wasn't there and wouldn't listen to me. They kept yelling at each other and wouldn't acknowledge me. I couldn't think of what I could do because they were about to turn violent. I picked up one of my daughters and took her to another room and told her she needed to stop.

I go to the kitchen to make lunch and I hear arguing again in my youngest daughter's room. Instead of picking one of them up again I just grabbed my spray water bottle (we have a cat that likes to jump everywhere). I sprayed them both until the argument stopped. It worked.

They don't respect me as much as their father. Since he is there for full time for a month and gets to be a full time stay at home Dad for a month. Meanwhile I still work at my accounting job full time.

It just bothered me, nothing against him, I just prefer not to have non-residents over for extended time without either me or my roommate there. So I woke up him up and had him leave as I was getting ready for my appointment. As I drove to it my roommate called me from work and asked why I did that.

I asked her what was wrong, and she apologizes to me. She seemed pretty upset.

Now, a sidebar, I'm a very private and reserved guy. I take my privacy very seriously, and as such, I don't give passwords out to anyone, including my partners, and I hate it when people go through my photos or search history. Well, she got into my phone the night before and snooped around. She tells me she thought I was cheating (because apparently having a sense of privacy = cheating), and I got pretty upset. I'm not going to lie, I yelled at her and told her she has no respect for boundaries or my privacy. She kept crying and telling me it's okay, I didn't cheat, and she trusts me now, etc. This pissed me off, because she should have trusted me in the first place, and now I have no trust in her because I know she's the type of person who could even consider breaking into my personal belongings.

I broke up with her, as I have no desire to be with someone who doesn't respect my sense of privacy, and mistakes privacy for 'possibly cheating'. (By the way, I've never cheated on anyone in my life). She's texted me so many times, and she and her friend keep calling me an asshole without any forgiveness in my heart.

The mall was all being used, AAA was broken and when I pulled up to the Cafe there was a gas Audi parked in the spot. I googled my states law and it states:

> Florida Statute 366.94 Electric vehicle charging stations
(3)(a) It is unlawful for a person to stop, stand, or park a vehicle that is not capable of using an electrical recharging station within any parking space specifically designated for charging an electric vehicle.
(b) If a law enforcement officer finds a motor vehicle in violation of this subsection, the officer or specialist shall charge the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle in violation with a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as provided in s. 316.008(4) or s. 318.18.

I was stuck waiting here since I didn’t have enough to get me to the next one (which could be broken or in use) and it was the only one working since AAA was broken and not just busy. 

I called the non-emergency line to complain, I even asked two workers if they knew whose car it was, they didn’t know.  I waited in the closest spot hoping police or owner of said car would do something. 

Cop shows up comes over to me an says “There is no law for this so why did you call me?” I showed him the above quoted statue and he says “I have to look this up.”  He goes back to his squad car and the owner comes out yelling at me that it’s his car and he paid $1500 to install that and if he wants to park there he will and I need to get off his property or he will hit me with trespassing. Now I have to pay to park and charge in that spot, this was not a free charge while you eat/shop kind of thing. Cop comes out to say that I am right, it is illegal to block the spot and he also cannot ask me to leave because I am paying for the spot and I have a contract with ChargePoint the actual owner of the charger.

We went to do an inter facility transfer for a guy who was basically just really sad and depressed, so a transfer from the hospital to a mental health care facility. I warned the trainee that I don’t like to talk too much to the mental health patients because they can be really unpredictable. I told her to just sit in the back, far away from him, and let him rest/sleep. We loaded him up and we were driving, and after he answered some of the basic questions and we were sitting, he was just talking to himself about how the roads are bad and he used to live in another state that was warmer and with better roads. The trainee, against my instructions, started talking to him about living in the state. Yeah, the guy was pretty harmless it turns out and they just had a little friendly discussion, but she went specifically against what I told her to do. The rest of her work was fine I guess, but I spoke to my partner privately about how she refused to follow my instructions and could have put me and herself at risk. Because of this, both me and my partner refused to sign her form saying she’d completed the hours.

I got a call from the training academy that runs her program. The guy said there was no harm in what she’d done, she was really upset, and couldn’t I just sign off so she could pass her class?

This young girl came in, she couldn’t have looked older than 16-17 years old. I would say she even looked younger but she was driving a car, so she had to be at least 16. 

She came to purchase a bottle of hard liquor, and a case of beer. She looked a little frustrated and seemed to be in a rush. Now, I will admit I already expected her to hand me a piece of cardboard with a fake picture on it, but she handed me what looked like a real ID. 

I stared at the ID for a while trying to catch any mistakes because she really looked so young! So at this point she seems a little irritated and she says “yes I know I look young—I just turned 21 this January”. So in my head I’m thinking she’s saying this to play it off because she knows I’m suspicious. I didn’t say anything I just looked at her and swiped the ID on the computer. It went through. 

So I told my co worker in our language that she really looks so young and I wouldn’t be surprised if she was not 21 like she says. She paid for her things and before she left she called me an asshole in my language, I will admit I was embarrassed.

0,"AITA for not following OCD mums rules? | I (23F) moved out of my parents house in October but when the pandemic started they asked if I wanted to move back in temporarily so I wasn’t on my own. I was nervous about being isolated for so long (history of mental health issues and don’t cope well) so I said yes and moved in mid March. 

My mum has always ran her house in a very particular way. She has rules that, as kids, we always followed and never questioned because we just thought they were the norm. I.E nobody ever touches the curtains except her, washing up is always done as soon as you finish eating, cushions are never allowed to touch the floor etc. Now I know these things are really important to my mum. She used to have really bad OCD (would spend 6 hours a day folding towels until they were perfect) and she has got a lot better. Most things I do out of habit and aren’t an issue. But there are some rules that I am struggling so hard to follow and we’ve had lots of arguments about it. 

For instance, nobody is allowed to sleep past 9am on a weekday. I struggle getting to sleep at night and sometimes I’m up until 2/3 am. But she insists that we get up anyway even though we then have little to do in the day. Regardless of whether we get up or not, she always comments things like “you might be happy being lazy slobs but I don’t want to live like that” and is always making little remarks about our day. 

Eating is an issue. We have time windows as to when we can eat certain meals and if you miss it, you don’t eat. Like today, my parents are doing some work on the kitchen. I went in to make some toast but she said no as I would be in the way. I then went back when they were finished to be told no again because it was too late. Haven’t eaten.

We’re not allowed to do things that make a mess. To pass the time I brought some arts and crafts and puzzles home. But nope. Too messy. My dad isn’t allowed to get his DJ equipment out because she can’t stand the wires. Then we get moaned at if we just sit and watch tv. 

There’s other things like, doors and windows have to be open all day even though it’s cold, I’m forced to take medication I don’t really want. (I’m asthmatic and my mum insists an antihistamine a day will help but I never take them at home and I am fine) I’m always called to help out while my 19 year old brother does sod all. And then to top it all off, we get moaned at if we don’t help out but if we do everything is redone because it isn’t the way she likes it. 

I decided to confront her and my brother and dad agreed with me but it just ended in a massive argument, with my mum saying we were all picking on her. It’s now really tense and I’m just so frustrated. I know I should be grateful that they’re letting me stay and I need to take my mums OCD in to account, but should she really have this much control over everyone?

For clarification purposes,  she was in the girl scouts.  I was not in the boy scouts. I tried to explain to her last night after hearing the news of girls being allowed in the boy scouts that I no longer feel comfortable encouraging our young son to participate in the boy scouts now that girls are allowed in the boy scouts. It seems like common sense to me. Girls go in the girl scouts,  boys go in the boy scouts... hence the name GIRL scouts and BOY scouts.  Her explanation was that she quit the girl scouts because they didn't do cool stuff like the boy scouts and she feels as if girls should be allowed into the boy scouts.  I explained to her that the coolness factor she spoke of was merely her perception as a bit of a tomboy as a youngster. In addition, while yes it is pretty cool to become an eagle scout, this coolness factor needed to be addressed in the higher management of the girl scouts and not just solved by blurring lines and pushing the girls that want to do cooler stuff  into an organization that is already taxed by other recent changes and guidelines that are due to affect boy scout membership in a not so positive light. She assures me that my thinking is outdated and antiquated and that boys these days don't care if girls are in the girl scouts. I, on the other hand,  view it as a matter of principle. I love my spouse dearly and am trying hard to understand her point of view simply because we she be a united front, but I just am having an extremely difficult time getting past this very basic premise.

I want to know if I should apologize for a small prank. My wife and I had a couple over who have a kid the same age as one of ours.  We’d had a bunch of really pleasant, borderline fun meetings at our kids’ games or around town, but never hung out officially. We’ve also seen them in church several times. We invited them over for dinner & drinks three weeks ago, and it was going well, so I decided to try a funny prank. 

The night was going well, and my wife signaled that dinner was ready, and we all came around the table. I asked if the other couple would join hands with us in prayer. They seemed very happy to. 

My joke is that I say a very very long prayer, giving ‘thanks’ for things for an uncomfortable period of time, all while making everyone hold hands. I started the prayer thanking the Lord for friends and then halfway thru said the “bless us oh lord” prayer, and then immediately started praying again, and it was getting more and more absurd, like saying, “…And for the rolling wheat, dear lord, the wheat which wheatens our bodies…” and then I made everyone say the Our Father.    
(I've done this before, but with couples that I know a lot better.  It usually ends when someone objects or says, ""seriously?"" or something.)

Then I did a couple head fake prayer endings, like saying, “and in the lords name we say?THAT we’re grateful for air conditioning on your hot hot summer nights oh lord,” etc. (As is probably obvious, I still think this is funny)

I finally ended the prayer and it didn’t go over.  I kind of had to act as if it was a serious prayer.  My wife was embarrassed, even though she knows who she married, on top of being mad that the food was mostly cold. And the night definitely changed. It was going really well, and then it was just a little awkward.

1,"AITA for putting my dog's poop bags in other people's trash cans? | When I walk my dog around the neighborhood I pick up his poop and carry the poop bag until I reach a trash can, either a permanent city trash can, like the one you might find at an intersection, or, if they are by the street, a wheeled trash can that is in front of someone's house. 

OK, I know I might get some hate for this but I have a couple things I feel justify my actions. 

The trash cans I'm talking about are provided by the city, printed on the receptacle in huge letters is ""PROPERTY OF CITY OF (MY CITY)"". The city does not charge you for the trash cans. They are a requirement of using the city's provided trash service (Which they do charge for). Trash pick up is once a week, and it is common in my neighborhood for people to just leave the trash cans outside in that strip between the sidewalk and the street all the time. 

I only ever put anything in these trash cans if they are on the street, or accessible from the sidewalk. I don't go onto private property or seek out the cans if they are not immediately visible.

I tie a knot in the poop bag to seal the poop inside and reduce odor. 

I'm not a hypocrite here, if I leave my trash cans outside and someone else puts their dogs poop in my can I don't care. I do however, store my trash cans in my rear of my property so they are not  visible or accessible from the sidewalk. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm the AH because it stinks up people's trash cans, and technically- it's illegal to dump trash in these cans without permission.

She started in fanfiction when she was younger and moved into original writing, which I know she posts online because I monitored her Internet when she was a child. Back then I read one of her fanfics despite my husband's worry that it was an invasion of privacy (if it was private she wouldn't have posted it online). I didn't think it was good, but I didn't bring it up since she was still developing her skills and I didn't think critiquing a child's fanfic was appropriate.

She's 16 and I decided to ask for access to her stories this time. At first she was uncomfortable, but I told her I wanted to check in with her writing and see how she's progressed since she was a kid. I know it's her favorite hobby and I want to be a part of it. She gave in and linked me to her page on a website for oc and told me I could read whatever I want.

I only read two because that was more than enough for me. While it's clear her skills have matured through the years, so have her tastes. Both stories were almost gothic, very creepy and atmospheric with open endings and mature themes. Neither were my thing.

After a week she asked me what I read, and I was honest. She seemed disappointed (as opposed to originally not wanting me to see any) and asked if I didn't like them. I told her she was a fine writer, but the genre just wasn't for me and her style was too modern for my tastes. I also said I had some pointers if she wanted them, and she said she did, so I gave her a more in-depth critique. Beyond my personal preferences, I had noticed she had some issues with grammar and in one of the stories she wasn't writing engaging action scenes and often repeated the same adjective a lot.

Well, she's talked to her father and I guess that was part of the style. The incorrect grammar was purposeful and a way of visual storytelling that she was using to show a characters state of mind. The repitition of adjectives was deliberate and was meant to feel off, she described it as 'an uncanny valley vibe'. Like I said, not my style.

My husband  thinks I was way out of line not only having my daughter let me read her work but also then criticizing it. I say that if she really hadn't wanted me to see it, I would have backed off, but she gave in very easily and I genuinely wanted access to something important to her. Besides, I didn't insult her work. I asked her if she wanted pointers and gave her advice I know from a long life of reading books (I was an English major, for God's sake). If my advice was unhelpful, she can just ignore it-I already told her I didn't get her style. Also, she's almost an adult. I don't think giving criticism is so bad anymore.

I, along with several others, are lifeguards at a small member-only pool for the summer. For the past couple months, we have dealt with an unruly child (who I’ll call M), who is absolutely disobedient. 

M has spit on other pool members, jumped in the water during adult swim (he’s 7), touched pool equipment despite multiple warnings not to, has run under guard stands despite warning, and once sprayed me with a water gun after I specifically told him not to.

&#x200B;

I've always been the resident chef for my family. My wife is an awful cook (her words, not mine) so over the years I've been the one to cook every meal for my family. I've spent a lot of time learning too. I've taken multiple classes each year to help me and honestly it's slowly became a passion of mine. So, for most of the night for the past 16 years i've come home and spent at least an hour, often several making diner for my family. 

This is where my daughter comes in, lets call her sally. Sally turned 16 this year and oh boy has it been rough. She never left her rebellious phase. She has always tried to make me and her mom know how much she hates us and that she can't wait till she's in the ""real world"" so she can finally be free. I get it. She's at that age where she wants more freedom and sometimes we can be hard on her. That's not the problem here. 

One of sally's new things though is telling me how much my cooking sucks. For the past two weeks every night i've cooked she will tell me everything wrong with the meal i've cooked. She will go on all night about the ""crap"" I forced her to eat and that she should just be able to cook her own meal instead. She's far past the age of letting her go hungry so I just have let it go, until last night. I got off work late so I just decided to grab burgers on the way home for diner. Sally went on and on after about how she ""finally had decent food to eat"" and that ""this stuff wasn't cooked by a pathetic wannabe chef"". I don't know why but that hit me hard and I ended up crying in my room after. My wife caught me and told me it needs to stop now. 

So tonight when I got home I cooked enough for me, my wife, and my son. I steamed some rice and beans and put them on a plate for my daughter. When she came to eat I informed her since I only cook ""crap"" i made her something else and that was all she would be eating in this house from now on. She blew up. She called me an ass and a bad father before storming to her room. My son things I'm just being mean and that i've sunk to her level while my wife says I did the right thing. I talked to my mom too and she says this was a heavy over reaction and that all teens do this at some point and that I only will make things worse.

1,"AITA for denying my wife a new kitchen? |  

Married for 8 years. 3 kids - aged 3 to 8. We live in a large 1980's house. When we bought it the plan and my promise was to completely refurbish. We've done about half the house - thoroughly, but not too much in the last years b/c of lots of work, small kids.

My wife now insists we refurbish the kitchen. The kitchen is now over 30 years old, originally very expensive but now shows its age. It is totally usable though, and in my eyes it's not that bad, though I agree it's not what we really want. But I don't want to fix the kitchen, not unconditionally.

She has a low income job, I'm high income. She works 70%, I work well above 150%, many evenings, weekends. I pay 90% of our bills from my salary. The new kitchen will cost $100k+. This will be all up to me to pay. We've had a few rounds of redecorations earlier, with contractors, and even though we didn't do much of the actual work ourselves - all the things like making plans and detailed decisions, dealing with contractors, buying materials, etc - I had to do it. She prefers to distance herself from these projects, just wants to ""get it done"" but doesn't want to be very involved in the ""doing"".

Furthermore, I've developed this feeling that she doesn't really deserve a new kitchen. She has no real interest in cooking dinner - and thinks that I should be the designated ""gourmet chef"" in the house. Dinner is usually just thrown together in 15 minutes. She has recently turned vegetarian, which I - a meat lover- is decidedly unhappy with. But even these new veggie meals are usually just the same goop as before - minus the meat. I can hardly remember 2 occacions where she made a well-planned and tasty meat meal for me. Otherwise, her dinner priorities is it has to be quick, for the kids, for her, and I just have to eat with my mouth shut.

So I've told her that she's not getting a new kitchen unless something changes. I want her to gain interest in cooking. I want at least once a week a meal of my liking. I want the purpose for a new kitchen to get better food, not just something to show visitors. I want her to more involved in the project itself, not just showing me pictures from magazines. Things like editing work plans, find serial numbers for items I must buy, and actually talk to contractors herself and not just through me.

She oppose this. Says I owe her and promised her this kitchen. She does most of the cooking anyway (I make dinner 2 times a week), and if I'm not happy I can just cook more myself. She must have something in return for all working nights and weekends where she has been left with the kids alone, and that I act like a Scrooge. She feels unempowered since I have veto on major decisions. Since I'm paying this and has to see it through, I feel it must be done on my terms.

He nodded and told me, that he doesn't know it though, because it's supposed to be kept a secret.
I was okay with that.   

I told my bf tho, that my mom's now giving birth etc. etc. I need to take care of my brothers and probably can't game this evening.

He asked every 20 minutes what the child's name was.   

And as I was kinda embarrassed about the fact, that I didn't know it either yet, I told him, that he can ask my mother himself.   

Then he kept bugging me like ""my mother wants to know the name of your sister"", ""my mother wants to know now"" every 20-30 minutes.

A little back story before I get into the AITA part: 

My son isn’t biologically my son. His father died when he was very young (6ish) and his mother was unfit to raise him. My husband and I took him in and have been with him ever since. He was generally an excellent child. He’s given us endless joy and happiness. Recently though, he’s started to act out. At first it was small. Breaking curfew, lying, hanging out with questionables. We tried talking, because he is a straight A, chess club, football, beta club all around good kid. 

It didn’t work. We tried grounding. Screaming. Listening. You name it we’ve tried it. His misbehavior is only escalating though. He was caught smoking weed. (I know weed isn’t huge and I’ve always been open about that conversation but clear that he was expected to stay away until he was 18 an adult to make that decision.) He was involved in a hit and run. He was caught stealing. 

This catches us up to our story now. In the middle of the night I get a call from the police, again. This time, our son was caught tagging an abandoned house and had taken my husband’s revolver from the safe. 

He was charged for the gun and released to us. The officers were really great to us but I wish they wouldn’t have been so cool in front of son. 

I was livid and screamed at him, took away all of his privileges, anything I could think of and he still is treating it as a joke. He told my SIL that he thought it was all funny.

I don't think I am, I think I'm being a good parent. | I'm a father of 2 kids. My older daughter is in college and lives with us still. My younger one however is the rebellious and problem child that loves to wrangle out of my control.

At around 11 or so we found he discovered the dark side of the internet, and since then we've put parental controls and time restrictions on the computer. the doctor recommended limiting screen time and exposure because it could have negative health effects. (This is a doctor with an M.D., his advice outweighs anything my son has to say.)

This worked well for a while, but then multiple times he found a way around the filters and kept violating our rules of usage, and used the computer at night. Every time we took it away for a week and tightened the controls and there was a password. Everything went well for some time, until I checked the browsing history and found that he had violated the rules again, and was now going on troll and skeptic/atheist forums that perpetuate misinformation and aren't good for him.

This was also the time where he got his first gaming computer that I got from my coworker's son who moved away to college, so before giving this to him, we made sure that he couldn't bypass our restrictions. We put Windows controls on it that can't be bypassed. He also must fill out a form that logs his hours and what sites he goes on, because now there is a zero tolerance policy. He must report everything he does to us, because he's consistently shown he can't be trusted with any semblance of privacy or autonomy, so now I've imposed a policy similar to my work; everything must be transparent to the authority of the establishment, and if there's any pushback or resistance, there will be consequences. His computer is now out in the open so there's peer pressure to stay obedient. And he's limited to 2 hours a day and has to be off before 6pm so the blue light and radiation don't affect his sleep.

Around this time my son was 16 going on 17, and started to express discontent over our ""draconian"" rules and being monitored and controlled so much, because the controls often filter sites that are totally safe and locks him out in the middle of games, and when we're away he can't get the password to allow more time. I said that as long as he lives here then he will abide by the rules, and this inconvenience and restriction will teach him not to be so rebellious and deceitful. Plus I'm paying for the internet and electricity, he has no right to complain.

1,"AITA for “forcing” a kid to pee on himself? | Many years ago, I used to teach karate classes to kids age 4 through about 14. The way I taught the classes varied greatly based on the average age in the group.

Aside from learning the sport of a martial art the class also instills values such as responsibility. 

For my older classes, say ages 10 and up, one expectation I had of them was to use the restroom before they come to class.  It’s a simple thing to remember to do and it helps avoid disruptions.  However, I am not such a hard ass that I wouldn’t let a kid use the bathroom in the middle of class if they really needed to. 

The rule was if you do need to go to the restroom in the middle of class you can go, but when you come back the whole class will do jumping jacks in your honor.  Bear in mind, they’re going to do the jumping jacks one way or the other.  But, by dedicating this round to you maybe you (and everyone else) will be reminded to go to the restroom before class next time. It’s honestly all in good fun and was always “enforced” with a somewhat playful wagging of the finger.  Again, exercise is part of the class so it’s not like we weren’t going to do them anyway.  As martial arts instructors go, I was a bit of a softy to be perfectly honest. 

I had never, ever had a problem with this policy from any child or parent before. But one night after class I got an email from a parent saying that her child was “forced” to urinate on himself during my class. I was genuinely very confused and asked what the heck she was talking about. 

She said her son was so afraid of the punishment and what the other kids would think of him if they had to do jumping jacks on his behalf that he held it until he couldn’t hold it anymore, wet himself, and continued the class with wet pants. (I didn’t notice that his pants were wet, mostly because I don’t look at young boys crotches all that much, but also the jacket part of their uniform sort of covers that area anyway.). He was 11 or 12 years old, by the way. 

This is the part where I question my assholery; I basically told her that if her son was not mature enough to both remember the rule and/or be willing to accept the very benign consequence of forgetting the rule that he was perhaps not quite ready for the class.  

Holding it until he wet himself was entirely unnecessary.  I get that he may have seen it as a bigger deal than it was but at his age he should be able to reconcile the fact that the other kids would be mildly annoyed by him for a total of 30 seconds...the whole point of the class is to grow as a person and learn to deal with that type of thing with humility. 

Anyway, they did not come back to the class.  I guess they decided I was too cruel, or perhaps they agreed he wasn’t ready (I believe it was the former).  I may have prevented him from ever achieving his greatest potential as a martial artist, but somehow I doubt it.

0,"AITA for going to the bathroom with my cousin at a restaurant? | Baity title but it basically sums up the situation.

My cousin and I are both M(19) and we were out to eat at a popular local restaurant. We split some wings, and after we were done eating we went to go wash our hands. We walked through the back hallway to where the bathrooms are located and entered into the men's restroom. The bathroom was a one person, so there was only a toilet and a sink with a lock on the door. We figured it was no big deal if we both went in to wash our hands and talk with some privacy for a minute while away from our friends who ate with us. 

I locked the door so no one walks in on accident and we start washing our hands. We arent in the bathroom more than 15 seconds before we hear 3 pounding knocks on the door. Figuring it was one of our friends messing with us, I let out a deep voiced ""HEY"". All of a sudden the door bursts open and some bearded guy with an angry face(who turned out to be the owner of the establishment) comes in and starts berating us. 

I was pretty sure I locked the door, but he must have used a key to get in. He bursts in asking ""wtf are you guys doing, holding hands in here?"". My cousin and I both look at each other in shock and confusion. We both turn and just stare at him because we are caught so off guard. It's bad enough when someone walks in on you and it ends with a quick, mumbled ""Oh shi- sorry"" and a pang of embarrassment. It's a whole different experience when someone walks in on on you and THEY start berating YOU. 

Anyways we shuffled out of the bathroom, still confused as to what the problem is. Obviously we know the bathroom is meant for one person, but we were just using the sink. We tell him we were just using the sink, and his explanation of his reaction to both of us in the bathroom was he's seen guys piss in the toilet and the sink at the same time. 

We left on good terms, the owner claimed he wasn't trying to cause any trouble with us and that we were all good, but his tone of voice and actions struck me as rude.

I feel his reaction was unwarranted, we were in the bathroom for less than 15 seconds before he barged in. I don't see what the big deal was, they have one sink and we went to use it at the same time.

0,"AITA for yelling at woman for double parking? | I was on my way to the train this morning and there’s a woman that has her daughter(?) drop her off every day. They double park (this is against the law) each time which causes traffic back up since they’re blocking the whole road. 

Before what comes next: I see them in various places on my commute, and they drive very slowly. Nothing against slow drivers, but people, including me, get around them because we are in a rush to get to work. 

So I decide enough is enough, and honk at them while they’re blocking the road considering the laws and the somewhat inconvenience it causes. Immediately after doing so, the woman proceeds to chase me down in my car screaming at me while I’m parking.

I get out and am immediately met with a bunch of “You’re a crazy driver” “You were riding our ass the whole way” (I only saw her on 1 street this morning within the first 5 minutes of my 20 minute commute to the train) and “You’re an asshole” statements.

It’s too early and I’m not about to just take any of it.

She almost always flip-flops in the warmer time and even now takes hers off and doesn't wear socks. She's kind of short so she'll sometimes kneel in her chair and her soles are very visible, sometimes walks around showing off her cute toes, and in the break room sometimes will lean back in one of the leather chairs and put her feet up on the rest.

So I'm a lesbian (don't talk about it much there or heavily advertise it) and I have a foot fetish. So frankly this gets REALLY distracting. For other WLW/straight guys imagine if a woman at your work liked to take her top off with no bra on and then casually let her boobs hang out. This is about the same for me. And her feet are legitimately very cute and she keeps them in great shape and paints her toes cute colors. It's enjoyable yet driving me crazy. I try not to do anything creepy or that I know would make straight women uncomfortable but this is kind of unavoidable.

She's technically violating dress code, so telling HR and them telling her she has to keep her shoes on is an option....but that's so Karen-esque and it seems wrong to report someone who hasn't really hurt anyone or to force her to wear shoes just because I don't have enough self control to ignore her. And just talking to her and asking it is needless to say something I'm too embarrassed to do (""oh hey could you please keep your shoes on or feet out of site? I like girls and have a foot fetish, it's distracting me so much."" Mortifying.)

1,"AITA for buying my 14 year-old daughter alcohol? | I’m a 45M and I have a 14y/o daughter (E) and a 10 y/o son (H). I live in the UK and recently married an American woman (40F) who has 4y/o twins who moved here 2 years ago. Me and my ex-wife split up about 3 years ago but we’re on really good terms and I consider her one of my closest friends. My wife moved in with me just before the wedding, 3-4 months ago. She was living quite close and we basically lived together anyway but due to work and both of us having kids, it was just a bit of a wing it situation each week.

Perhaps it’s my upbringing and culture (think fairly middle class, small town in the South) but we all drink a fair amount, my friends, family, everyone I know and I don’t think it’s any more than your average Brit. My wife isn’t a huge drinker compared to us and says she drinks about as much as a ‘normal American’ so she had a bit of a culture shock when she moved here.

It’s relatively normal for H to have half a pint of beer/small glass of port or perhaps a small glass of champagne during big occasions. Pretty similar to me and my friends as a kid and again, similar to my kids the same age in my family/friends circles. E has reached an age now where most of her friends are drinking, she’ll have a few ciders/light cocktails on the weekend at home and normally have a glass or two of wine at a restaurant or a pub. There’s been big functions like birthdays, Christmas etc where she’ll be a little drunk off like 5-6 ciders with her friends/cousins. So far it’s always been family/friends events so we’re there to make sure nothing gets out of hand.

Her school friends don’t have the ‘drinking vodka in a park’ approach like most young teens in the UK do (or used to until recently?) and it’s a lot safer with less alcohol than when we were her age. They’ll have a few drinks at a friend’s house where parents are there or a large party every month. Parties are the only time she's properly drunk strong liquor like vodka (1 drink/2 shots in front of me at most). I’ve bought her cider, wine, 20% Malibu etc. to have with her friends. Me and my ex-wife always make sure she’s safe, WE are her parents and completely in agreement over raising both kids on this issue.

However, my wife has become really freaked out about it and says it’s really dangerous, weird and she feels really uncomfortable and makes me feel like a terrible parent when this is the norm for me and seems a lot safer than the American approach. I’ve tried telling my wife that there’s other countries/cultures with lower rates of alcoholism where we’d be seen as strict. She’s said she feels it’s unsafe around her kids but I’ve said I won’t ever overstep those boundaries and won’t give them any alcohol unless she agrees and at 4 they have no idea about alcohol and how old you have to be to have it, we can just say ‘you’re allowed when you’re older’ but so far they haven’t asked/shown they understand it.

0,"WIBTA for not giving my sister a share of my inheritance - to give to her daughters? | My father died last year. Beforehand he showed me the final copy of his will - it was simple, 50% to me, 50% to my half-sister. 

&nbsp;

I wasn't always close with my Dad (parents split when I was young) and as a result I've never been close with my half-sister. She's much older than me, we've never lived together and until last summer we hadn't seen each other in 10 years. She has two daughters, one of whom I've never met. At this meeting, she did mention she'd *hoped* Dad would give something specifically to her daughters, but I shrugged this off as I knew he hadn't and I assumed she must not have seen the will.

&nbsp;

A few months later and upon sorting the estate, I’m waiting for her to send me some documents, including the will, to sign. I message to ask if she's received them yet and if she can forward them to me. This message is the reply I get; 

&nbsp;

'*I need to talk to you - Dad did want to leave something to the girls but was too ill to sort!*' 

&nbsp;

Again, when shown the will and multiple times discussing it with him later, my Dad didn't once say he'd wanted to change anything. Asking for clarification, in genuinely as calm a tone as I write this post, stating that he'd been through the will with me beforehand, I simply ask what exactly Dad said he wanted to change? From seemingly nowhere I then receive this exact response; 

&nbsp;

'*Hang on! What's your problem with this? I don't want the money it would go straight into the girls account. I'm surprise you are even doubting it!!!! Think about it, Dad loved my girls and wanted them look after. I spent a lot more time with dad so had more opportunities to discuss this. He even had their bank details in the care home but I could ask him to call the bank as he was too ill and too tired. Fucking hell, are you for real?!*' 

&nbsp;

Asking her to calm down, stating all I ever did was ask what Dad said and how much he'd wanted to give to them, I eventually get clarification that they never discussed specifics - 'he just said he wanted them looked after'. Happy to provide my messages word for word in the comments if need be, I'm just aware of going over the character limit here.

&nbsp;

Despite not being close with them and not having even met both daughters, as someone with no children of my own, I had previously considered offering some of the money as extra to them. But due to being largely kept out of the loop of funeral organisation and in the end only being told about the burial of the ashes literally less than 48 hours beforehand, I realised as we really aren't close, that's not my concern and if that's what Dad *really* wanted, he'd have included it in the will in the first place. This latest exchange just cements that feeling.

I saw my younger siblings ""Natalie"" and ""Richard"" (11F and 12M respectively) chilling in the living room. Richard was on the PS4 and Natalie was watching YouTube on her tablet. I told them that now's not the best of times to be playing around and after they get their stuff done, only then can they play.

Richard saw the sense in my words but Natalie decided to leave the room straightaway. I asked where to and she said that she needed to do her hair since it gets in the way whenever she looks down.

My brother said stepfather was controlling, didn't let drink, set the curfew to 11pm and ground him. I thought these are what parents do to their child, and pretty childish of him to hold a grudge over stepfather taking care of him, but he said I wouldn't understand cause I didn't live there, so I just let it go.

Those arguments would always end up with them calling me a drug addict and when I would get mad and start shouting at them they would tell me that I am high and that it is making me overreact and emotionally impulsive. After a while they started getting so paranoid that they wouldn't even let me stay over at my friends' houses over the night (and it was not that common either) because they were stoners and they would start texting me at 3 am to come back and ask me whats my friends address to find me whenever I would say no. If I showed up high at my house they would start harassing me and I would shout at them for it and that would only confirm their beliefs that being high made me unreasonable and angry (it didn't). One time after we argued that they should let me go to my friend's house over the night because they let my sister got to her friend's house they said no because I have ruined their trust. So I sneaked out and once they found out they went to the police department after insulting me and made me talk to the police officer over the phone. They would rationalize their controlling behavior by saying that they want to protect me but I found them extremely disrespectful since they were not even protecting me from anything, their views on marijuana were based on the stereotype that all stoners are losers.

Eventually, I got so sick of it and whenever my parents would come tired and stressed from work I would argue with them not because I wanted to change their minds, but in order to apply more pressure to them and make them have a mental breakdown out of spite. I eventually stopped smoking weed because I didn't like it that much, I even threw my dab pen in the trash to prove to them that I was not addicted. They knew I smoked once in a while but they stopped harassing me since I had a 4.0 GPA in my first semester in college. It was too late by then, I had no respect for them and I would ignore most of their calls and texts for the entire semester out of spite which really hurt them but I had no remorse for them. I knew my parents loved me but had no respect for me, in their eyes I was just a depraved drug addict, and respect is the foundation of any relationship, love means nothing to me I am not being respected by someone, and so I would ignore them because I knew I could not change their mind but still wanted to punish them for it and force them to respect me by threatening to cut them off entirely when I was away for the semester.

1,"AITA for saying that believing in rocks and studying medicine are incompatible? | So, I study medicine.

Today we were at the cafeteria, and someone said that another classmate of ours carries around a rock in a necklace, because she believes it helps her and gives her good luck. I said literally (and I said literally because it is important to state exactly what I said, given the amount of hate I received from this comment): ""*I think believing in rocks has no place in this career, and that I would rather send a patient towards a doctor that does no believe in rocks, horoscope,* even god*, that one that does*"".

And a tidal wave of hate started towards me. People saying that there is no problem believing in rocks if you can totally divorce it from the actual medical-scientific based knowledge. Another argument arose, saying that by that reasoning, no one that believes in god should study this career, because it is not evidence based.

Is it an asshole comment the one I stated?

AM I an asshole for that comment (I already apologized and I did it sincerely, because one particular friend was very very angry, but I did it thinking that maybe I said it in a wrong matter or worded it wrongly, but I didn't say it because I think im wrong). My posture; if you are studying to become a professional in the medical area, you should base what you know, and what you think you know, on evidence. Why? Because tomorrow you´ll be responsible for peoples lives. How reliable can you be on your medical knowledge if (even though very well divorced from your career) you believe a rock is going to help you? Shouldn't the things you know be in alignment with every part of your life?

In regards to the god argument, I think sincerely that I should not have said that. I do not believe in god, but it doesn't sound right to say that no doctor should believe in god. However, to me again, it sounds perfectly sound to say that a doctor should not believe in rocks, even if they are for ""personal and spiritual and intimate uses"".

My daughter is 17. She’s a really great kid, extremely smart and talented and is in college a year early. Before she went away for college she was always a straight-edged kid, would never go out too late at night and was always home before curfew. As a single mom I put a lot of trust and faith in my kid to continue on the straight path. 

However, after she went away for college, she came back completely different. She’s sarcastic, snarky, and always plays “devil’s advocate” when I’m disciplining her. She’s become extremely different and I don’t even recognize her as my kid. 

The last straw was a few days ago when she came to ask if she could get a tongue piercing. I was completely blown away, as she has a low pain tolerance and didn’t even want the two lobe piercings she has now. I told her no, that she’s too young for something like that. She sort of smirked and said she’d just get it in September (when she turns 18). 

I told her very seriously that if she gets a tongue piercing she’s not welcomed to live in my house anymore. She asked why, and I told her because I didn’t want her to. She said she’ll be 18, so what does it matter? I told her as long as she’s under my roof she’ll abide by my rules about what she can and can’t wear/have/do. 

She got red in the face and said she was kidding about the tongue piercing, but she thinks i need to “re-evaluate my views on her right to bodily autonomy.” 

At this point I’m very tired of her sarcasm and need to always be right. Her grandmother thinks she’s right about me re-evaluating my views, though she’s also against the tongue piercing. Now my daughter hasn’t left her room and doesn’t want to talk to me. AITA?",False,False,3,4,2,5,2,3,Authority

0,"AITA for smoking weed on my patio, even though it disturbs my neighbor? | I have been living in my apartment for a little over 6 months now. During this time I've had no problems sitting on my patio and enjoying a pipe or a joint. 

However, the family that lived above me moved out and was shortly after replaced by a young (mid 20s?) couple. The first time I saw them on the patio after they'd moved in, I said hello and introduced myself, the woman complimented my dog and that was that. Later on that night, I decide to bring my (small) bong outside for a short while. At this point, I'd heard them talking on their patio for a while, so I knew they were out there but I didn't think anything of it. Very shortly after I started smoking, one of them said something and they both started laughing and went inside. I thought ok whatever. But since then, every time I walk by and anyone's on the patio they'll ignore me when I wave, and whenever I go on the patio while they're out there they immediately go inside (sometimes even when I'm not even going out to smoke, it's like they just don't want to be around to even risk it).

So it seems pretty obvious to me that the smoking bothers them, since our introduction was so positive and everything since has been really strange and icy. While I know that I'm not breaking any rules (legal in my state and confirmed with the apartment when I first moved in that it was a smoking community) and am allowed to do what I'm doing, I kind of feel bad going out when I know they've been outside enjoying a chat for a while.

1,"AITA for enforcing my daughter's roommate contract? | Hi Reddit! I’m in a 55 year old lawyer (female) and I need some clarification about an incident that recently occurred between my daughter (21) and her roommate (also 21). They are both in their senior year of college. For story’s sake, we’ll call my daughter Melody and her roommate Claudia.   

When they moved in together at the beginning of the semester, my daughter and I decided to make a roommate contract for them. My husband and I make the monthly rent payment, and Claudia is responsible for sending us her half of the rent. We asked early on that she send it within ten days before the end of the month to make sure everything’s in order (she has been very good about sending it on time, even over holiday breaks, though she has been two days late a few times).   

The roommate contract was not only to make sure rent was paid on time but also to outline cleaning duties and ensure the comfort of both Melody and Claudia. Here’s where things got sticky. Claudia has a boyfriend and Melody told me he’s been staying over at their place a couple nights a week. Melody and I were both uncomfortable because if she needed to leave her room when he was staying over, she’d have to pass Claudia’s bed behind the divider in the living room and would sometimes hear him/see him. Because of that, I drafted up an addendum to the contract saying that he could only stay over a maximum of two nights a week including weekends and that Claudia had to inform Melody at least a few hours before he came over.   

I thought this was completely reasonable. However, one week ago Claudia had her boyfriend over four times (DOUBLE what the girls agreed upon). Naturally, Melody was extremely upset and called me sobbing. I decided the only fair thing to do was to terminate Claudia’s part of the lease a month early. I gave her two weeks to move out, which even then felt too long knowing my daughter’s discomfort. She also left the bathroom disgustingly dirty (multiple times)!   

I’m posting because Claudia and her parents have all reached out to me asking for more time. The girls’ lease isn’t up until March and Claudia isn’t moving into a new place until then, also she claims she is taking the LSATs in just a few days and needs to study. Her family lives several hours away by plane but my daughter said Claudia’s talked about an uncle in their city, so it’s not like she would be out on the streets. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable by looking out for my daughter’s wellbeing, but Claudia and her family seem to think otherwise. AITA?",False,False,3,4,1,5,2,3,Authority

We even have some weird triangulation where I’ll address something with my future mother in law, and she’ll text him to try to convince him otherwise. 

The worst of it though is my mother. She’s always been my best friend. The problem though is she’s super assertive and takes over anything she works on.

They don't complete weekly wound measurements (the gold standard to ensure no deterioration occurs), they aren't ordering supplies for their patients, and they aren't completing thorough assessments. 



At the start I gave them gentle reminders about best practice, and offered constructive criticism on how they could improve. This didn't work, so I gave feedback to management (omitting names) on what I'm noticing so it could be discussed at our meetings. After numerous reminders and emails sent out over the span of months (by management) with no improvement I sat down frustrated, as their negligence resulted in more work for me and adverse effects for patients (as specific as I'd like to be.. But there were a few serious incidents where patients became upset to the point of tears as a result). 




After months of leeway I've started reporting any errors I catch directly to management including the name of the nurse. They finally listened, and sent out an email saying continued negligence will result in nurses being reprimanded up to and including termination + mandatory reporting to the nurse regulatory body in our province. This week I caught a TON of errors from one nurse in specific. Some smaller stuff: No wound measurements, not fully completing an admission chart, not ordering supplies on specified order days. Some bigger stuff, too: no vitals taken or a thorough pain assessment done (on a complex palliative patient.. There is no excuse for this), not answering patient page outs, etc. 




This eventually lead to this nurse having her first written warning in her employee file. I overheard her crying today, saying she's going to take a stress leave. I feel like I'm the cause. Yes, she continuously didn't complete basic tasks of her job, however I feel like a tattletale.

My wife sneaks it in as she knows I don't care for that shit at all. 

Why? Because most songs are old as fuck....or remixes of the old as fuck songs. It's like they gave up in the 60's. Last song was probably Mariah Carey's song and that had to be the early 90's. Everyone knows when Christmas is coming yet nobody wants to make a new song so why listen to the same 'ol songs for 1-2 months? When's the last time you wished someone a holly jolly Christmas outside of the months of Nov/Dec??? Have you really ever sung to someone that you'd be home for Christmas?

I usually go to turkey to visit family every 2 years, and we’ve been together for a while and have a great relationship so I decided to invite her to meet my family in Turkey.

Before we went I told her one rule she would need to follow. The one rule was do not refuse anything if you are offered, such as food and drinks, it is considered extremely disrespectful and rude. She agreed and said she would and that would be no big deal.

When we arrived, my uncle picked us up from the airport and went to his house. When we got settled in he brought out a bottle of moonshine, 3 shit glasses and offered us a shot. We obliged but when she brought it to her face, she didn’t like the smell and didn’t take it. (She drinks alcohol, so it’s nothing new to her for taking shots) Sure the shot was horrible but these people live in poverty and this is gold to them, and she disrespected my family for not taking it. So I pulled her aside to talk to her and was like,” what did I say the only rule was before coming here, I don’t care if it’s gross, you just have to take one” She started crying and calling me an asshole, so now I’m here asking you guys, am I really the asshole?

But it got later in the day and I was getting tired, so I turned to Sally and I said, “I’d like a coffee now, thanks.” She stared at me like I’d said something really weird, and then the judge said, “She’s here to use her law degree, not get you coffee” to me in a very impatient tone. When we left our lawyer said, “never be rude to the judge’s clerks.” I was not aware that the clerks have a more involved role, I saw her and she was acting like a secretary, taking notes and not saying anything.

She plays the game whenever she gets time after working and doing housework, she only spends time with my at night and ignores me when I try to talk to her. She also CONSTANTLY sketches and draws the characters from the game but gives special preference to a character whom she admits looks a little like a guy she once had a crush on.

All of this got really on my nerves because I told her that she must stop playing the game because it makes me uncomfortable and I didn't like her playing it. She brushed me off and said she only played it for the ""art"" and ""story"" and ""music"". We all know that's not why women play games like these. 

I got super irritated yesterday because the obsession had gotten worse and now she also started playing the music from the game on her guitar. So, I just took her phone and uninstalled the game from it yesterday morning

She didn't notice untill yesterday afternoon and when she discovered the app wasn't there anymore

She. Fucking. Flipped. 

She was telling my how I had violated her privacy and how I was disgusting for being jealous of a fictional character. She hit me below the belt and said that she never minded if I said some character in one of my games was so hot. I told her that I wasn't obsessed like she was. 

She isn't talking to me and is just being very bitchy because she didn't backup her progress and it's lost.

1,"AITA for calling out my wife’s behavior and telling her that she’s acting like a vapid Insta-thot? | 
Okay, I don’t normally go around calling my wife names, but we had a blowout and frankly, I’m pissed that she doesn’t seem to empathize at ALL on my POV. Need some perspective here

So my wife Kara got laid off, so we’ve been at home together pretty much 24/7 (I work from home). At first it was nice, but these past few weeks, work has been keeping me busy, so we haven’t been spending as much of the day together as we used to. She got bored eventually and decided to create an Instagram account.

Now I’m not huge on social media; I’m a private person (and she knows that), but she promised to just make it between her close friends and families. I thought that was reasonable, but a week in, she turned her profile public, with the rationale “the only people who’d stumble upon her is just old friends and friends of friends”. I think Kara underestimated just how pretty she was because soon, “just friends” turned into a 100, to 500, to 1000, to now a little over 5k followers in just a few weeks. Like I said, I’m a private person and a little uncomfortable with 5000 strangers seeing my house, my yard, my dog, etc, but she was having fun, so I tried not to nag her to much 

The problem is she ran out of old pictures to post, so she started taking new ones. This started to piss me off. For one, we can’t go anywhere, so the only place she can post is around the house, and it’s creepy having dozens of pictures of different places of your home online for thousands of people. For two, she ALWAYS pretties herself up, dresses up, even puts make-up on, etc, which bothers me a lot because before Instagram, we had problem with her always lazing around when she’s home, not showering for 3-4 days at a time, keeping her hair  greasy, etc. Essentially, she thinks rando strangers are good enough to take care of herself for, but when I essentially beg her to take a bath a few weeks prior, she’d drag her feet. Not to mention lately she’d have dozens of DMs and my wife is a chatterbox and would not SHUT UP about our personal life.

Eventually I told her that this was getting ridiculous, she’s not 16, and she needs to put hard limits onto who sees her account. She said no, that that’s controlling, and she can post what she wants.  I told her that’s fine, but she can’t post pictures of MY house.

My wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. 
While I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.

Her parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.

I thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.

The real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels ""good enough"" for a woman that he makes less than.

When I said, that if the truck was still here, he could do it when he got off work, and I would not have to drag half my installers tool box with me and work in the cold, I was called an Ass.

The final straw, was when we were going over vehicles for sale, and came across an ad for a 2013 New Beetle. He said we should sue them for false advertising.

She refused and said she doesn’t like to drink alcohol on flights. I said, ok, whatever. Cant help shooting my shot, right??

Anyways, a few hours later when the flight attendant came by, she ordered a beer. I remarked jokingly, “Thought you didn’t drink alcohol on flights.” She looked startled because she must have thought I was sleeping or something, and she said “Oh beer doesn’t count.” 

Anyways after she finished her beer, I ordered another one. Then when it came I handed it over to her instead. She said “No you have it” but I insisted. So she just said “Thanks I’ll save it for later” and put it in her carry on bag. I found her reaction amusing yet odd.

I told my friend about this interaction and she said that I probably creeped her out. Was I being impolite?

Then, two weeks later I went to her room again and found yet another pile that was poorly hidden under the desk. This time I didn't wash them and when she got back home I asked her once again the reason and she said she had forgotten. I made her wash them and she seemed like she had learned the lesson. 

After that I keep an eye on her and sure enough, a week later I found another pile. This time I told her that if I found any more of it I would throw them in the trash and she apologized. When I did find yet another pile a few weeks later I threw it in the trash and did the same thing last week to another one. Yesterday, she finally realized that most of her underwear was gone and she threw a fit.

Since this is just a side role of mine and we weren’t in desperate need, i was taking my time (as in a week/two) with reading before narrowing the pool and making some calls.

One of the resumes I received was from a man who we will call John. John submitted his resume on a Friday when I happened to be out of the office.

1,"WIBTAH if I told my 5yr old cousin to stop screaming at my dog?? | My husband and I and our two kids (6 & 8) have a 90lb black lab mix (4 years). He’s a good boy, but he’s massive. He is very clearly mixed with pit bull and that, combined with his size and color, makes him look intimidating. He’s never hurt a soul, not even our 9lb cat, and he’s well known in the family as a clumsy, excitable oaf. He positively loves children, especially our 8 year old. The worst thing he’s ever done is lick people’s faces. Our little one is generally not as excited about pets and takes time to warm up to them. We’ve trained her to understand that he is a member of our family and she is to be nice to him. He seems to understand this about her and shows his love for her in less intrusive ways. She was sick with the flu last week and any time she was laying on the couch with a blanket and watching TV, he was laying next to her and would not move until she got up. 

Anyways, we had extended family over for Christmas Eve. My husband’s uncle has a 5 year old daughter (Alexis). Alexis is visually impaired but wears glasses and nobody treats her any differently for it. This family doesn’t come over often, but when they do, Alexis screams at our dog whenever she sees him. It starts the moment they open our door, because the dog meets everyone at the door (normal dog stuff, imo). My husband helps calm the dog down while they get in and get situated, but her mistreatment of him doesn’t stop. Every time he enters a room, she screams at him to go away and waves him away. He doesn’t have to be anywhere near her for her to do this and he’s almost never doing anything that needs chastising.  

I get that he’s scary the first time you see him, but she seems to be more scared each successive time???? My dog does not deserve to be screeched at just for existing. IMO, she is disrespectful to my animals (family members in their own right) and my home and part of training our kids to be successful adults is teaching them how to behave outside of their home. If she’s truly terrified of my dog, that’s another conversation they should have with her, because most families have dogs. I have a strict policy of “my home, my rules” and being unkind to my animals is not something I will further tolerate.

My father is extremly controling and even though i'm 18 i still have to ask permission for nearly everything, including if i can go to the store or literally just across the yard to my neighbor's. His controling behavior didn't really bother me that much when i was younger because i was extremly introverted and didn't have friends at all, but in the last 2-3 years i met some incredible people who i'm lucky to call my friends and i changed as a person i became more talkative and more confident, however i started wishing i'd spent more time with them especially because some of them don't even go to the same school as me and i dont get to see them at all.

And thats how te problem was created I would ask my father if i can go hang out with my friends and he wouldn't let me, mind you these were reasonable requests i would ask to go hang out with them at 3pm and i would promise to be back by 6pm but he still wouldn't let me, my friends arent a bad company either none of them do drugs, they don't smoke and they don't even consume alcohol frequently, etc. So in order to spend more time with them i started lying i would say im going to the library but wouldn't tell im also meeting with a friend, or i would say im going on a ride with my motorcycle and i would park at my boyfriend's house and hang out with him, just stuff like that.

This weekend my niece was staying over because my oldest daughter was having a slumber party with two other girls from school. They watched Tangled and after the movie they were dressing up and playing in makeup and each other’s hair. 

I notice that my niece is a little left out here. She is biracial, and her mom keeps her hair in plaits and twists even though it is very long.

I own a car, and I use it when I have to, but the place I was interviewing was about two miles away from my home. An easy walk or bike ride.

I got the job and immediately started walking to work. Partially because I like to live frugally, but also because it's needed exercise from sitting on my butt being sedentary all day. If it's a little chillier, I tend to ride my bike because it's faster. Well one of my supervisors saw me coming in on my bike, which I locked up in the appropriate place, a bike rack in the courtyard. 

The supervisor who saw me came to my cube. She said ""I thought you said you had a car,"" and ""So is your car in the shop?"" and ""Do you ride your bike every day?"" and I got the feeling she was questioning to see if I'd lied in the interview or something. I explained to her that I liked to walk or ride in because of the exercise and said ""I could stand to lose a few pounds anyway, I'm getting kind of chunky."" 

She pursed her lips and said, ""I would encourage you to drive. We do track lateness, and it doesn't look very professional.""

I said, ""If the weather is very bad I will drive, but I don't like to drive my car for something under 3 miles. It just feels wasteful and lazy to me.""  This might be where I messed up, and I'm not sure. But she and many of the others are obese or overweight at least. 

For the record, I have never once been late to any job, ever. I am always very presentable, if it's a warmer day I have the appropriate ways to freshen up. If necessary, I can change my clothes. But it's such a quick ride or walk that it's hardly necessary.

1,"AITA for lying about my band to get us booked at a Christian youth club? | So basically when I was in college I was the drummer in a melodic metalcore band. We weren't really that good, but it was enough to keep high school kids of the era entertained. The only things we put out were a demo CD and a 7-inch. We did some regional tours and played a bunch at some venues in the major city near our college town, but there weren't many all ages venues in our town, we had to usually book at shows at places rented out like VFW halls or on campus.

There was one exception: a Christian youth club owned by a church. Problem is they were pretty restrictive, for example I remember going to a show there and some high school pop-punk band played a Green Day cover and they had to ""bleep out"" some of the words. So we weren't a good fit for it. However it hit me that the venue didn't necessarily know this.

So one day I was talking about getting booked. So I lied and said we were a Christian band. They agreed to book us and actually paid us pretty well. so we played...and didn't edit any of our songs. No need since our lyrics weren't intelligible anyway! The kids still got moshing and went crazy and actually bought a lot of our shirts and demos. Well this probably resulted in them reading our lyrics that were printed with the demo and we never got asked to come back lol.

Whenever I tell this story I get some people saying that's awesome and hilarious and some saying it was kind of a douchey thing. Personally I still think it was pretty cool and actually a very punk rock thing. My family didn't think so when I told them about it at a recent family gathering.

I was a bridesmaid at a wedding where the dress code was black tie optional. 

The guest in question was an old family friend of the groom, and she was probably in her mid 20s. While her dress was not overly formal or risque, it was very glamorous and attention grabbing. It's hard to describe, but she was wearing a sparkly blue cocktail dress that was probably designer, and stilletto heels that were absolutely designer. Her hair and makeup was also so perfect, it must have been done by a professional. Honestly, she looked like she walked off the red carpet of a movie premiere. 

She was certainly grabbing attention. During the cocktail hour many, many guests (none of whom know her) approached her to rave about her outfit. The bride noticed and while she didn't say anything, I could tell she was bothered by the split attention. 

At the reception, I ran into her in the bathroom and made a comment like ""nice outfit, but who are you trying to impress here? You're just a random guest."" She told me to mind my business and she left. I retold this story back at the table, and while a couple bridesmaids were on my side, some thought I was too harsh.

For context, I'm an early 30s woman who lives with my boyfriend. I'm frequently home during the day while he's at work. The neighbours in question are backyard neighbours, so the back of their backyard runs along the side of our backyard. I hope that makes sense. 

Soo I was just getting ready to take a shower, was undressed under my housecoat and grabbing a towel from the linen closet when I heard knocking at my door, followed a minute later by the doorbell. I wasn't expecting anyone, and in my current state of undress I didn't feel comfortable answering the door, so I ignored it. 

I was about to head to the bathroom when I saw a couple people coming down the driveway. Halfway down the drive we have a gate that we keep shut, latched and locked whenever we're home. It's over 5 feet tall and super awkward to unlatch/unlock from the outside. So I watch their figures through the closed curtains walking up and down the drive a couple times until they give up and leave. 

I got dressed then because I was like, Wtf is going on? Not five minutes have gone by, when I open my front door and see no one, no cars. But I see the front gate was left opened. I go over to close it, because we keep all gates closed so that our dog can roam freely, and see that the back gate is still closed. 

So I head back inside when I hear a far-off *Helloooo?*. I've got pretty sensitive anxiety and it just spiked at this point. I head to the back door and see someone standing there. It took me a moment to figure out it was my neighbor. He was very jovial, told me he was trying to get a hold of me because they had the cable guy over and he wanted access to my backyard. I was like, ""Fine, whatever. Bye."" But he kept asking if something was wrong, and kept pressing me when I tried to go back inside. 

My dog ran out and with the gates being open I called him back inside, and my neighbour continued to press me if there was anything wrong. I snapped and said, ""Yes! I was getting in the shower and then there were people running all around the house. I didn't know what was going on.""

He got really offended and reiterated that they weren't *in* my house. I said, ""No, just letting yourself through a locked gate and coming to the back door instead of waiting at the front door and ringing the bell again."" I closed the door and he let himself back out the gate, and the cable guy never even came in the backyard. 

I'm feeling a bit jerky but also like, no. His wife came and left after ringing the bell. He then took it upon himself to come back, not even attempt to go to the front door, but let himself into the closed yard when I'm home by myself and hadn't answered at the front door?

Recently, I switched from pursuing a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology to pursuing a M.S. in Environmental Science. There were many reasons behind this, but the biggest was that I was completely burnt out in my previous program. I only joined the program because I couldn't find a job with my B.S. in Psych. Ever since I joined, however, my parents have been bragging to everyone that they have a daughter who's getting a Ph.D.

When I switched, I didn't tell them (I told them 2 days ago, right after my first semester started). There were a lot of reasons behind this. One, I wanted to make sure I started successfully and had gotten everything figured out. Two, I knew they would disapprove. Their favorite insult for me since I was a small kid is ""tree-hugging liberal hippie"" and they adamantly don't believe that environmental science is a legitimate field. I actually wanted to pursue that as my undergraduate degree, but because they took out Parent PLUS loans for me and threatened to cut me off if I switched to that path (\~10k worth over 4 years, if that matters) I didn't.

I let them know 2 days ago, just to keep them in the loop. They went absolutely nuts on me, saying that I should have informed them so that they could change my mind. There was also a lot of talk about how I have absolutely wasted my life (I'm 24 right now), that I'll never get a job, that I've turned into a nutjob, etc. I tried to reason with them that I had my reasons for hiding it, and that I had only just started the program.

He then said that it showed that I did not see them as important. Extremely confused I said that I thought this was a casual conversation. My mom then said, well as you can see it is not.

Basically, we've worked hard our entire lives and got promoted till we got to this point where we make enough money to support a ""lavish"" lifestyle. I'm merely mentioning this because I believe that this fact is the core of our problem.

What I mean by that is that our income is giving some leeway for their mom to break their stuff. She often breaks their stuff when they misbehave, spend too much time on them or get bad grades. Now I believe that there should be some sort of punishment for when these stuff happen. Taking their stuff away for a while would be an okay punishment. However, breaking their stuff is extreme and wasteful. Moreover, when I say their stuff, I'm talking about Leah's phone (which costed a hair over $1000) and Jay's latest gaming console.

So, yesterday their mother had reached her boiling point and she smashed Leah's phone by throwing it full force at the floor, and she cut Jay's PS4 cords.

The housing market is terrible in the city I live in and it's nearly impossible for young people to buy a property. I managed to find a place that needed a lot of work done and I bought it as it was in a perfect area.

I paid the deposit in full, the mortgage is in my name and I spent close to a year supervising or doing the work to make the house liveable. My money, blood, sweat and quite a bit of tears have gone into this home. My GF on the other hand did not contribute anything to the house and doesn't believe/want to buy a house and is fine with renting a place forever. Furthermore she's not good with money so any savings she had are quickly spent. 

I moved into the house earlier this year, before then i was living at home. We discussed living together and I offered my GF to move in with me for free, she immediately asked whether her name would be on the deed and I said no. I have no problem with her living there for free but I've read too many horror stories of couples that have bought a house together and then broken up. Neither side budges and a house sale gets forced, I don't intend to sell my house.

This led to an argument where she said something along the lines of me ""planning for our break-up"". I relented and then said if she wanted to co-own the house she needed to start paying a market-rate rent for half the property which is a lot more than she's currently paying and would take 75% of her wage.

At first when I got it I was the only one to use it, with my father also knowing the password incase I searched up anything suspicious. My brother (12) and sister (9) begged me to let them play but I decided to not share the password in hope that my dad wouldn't give into them either.

About a month passes up until I come home after a night out with my mates to see my brother playing a game of mine on my set up, luckily, nothing was ruined, however I was extremely annoyed that my dad allowed him to play the computer.

I had a chat with my dad and he assured me that he'd only let my brother play when I was out with my friends.

I reluctantly agreed to this, however only because he made me feel bad if I didn't, something alot of people do to me as they know I hate disappointing others.

This continues up until about 2 months ago where it seems he is getting addicted to it and begs me to play it even if I am using it. I told him to f*ck of and get his own, which led to me being banned for a week and he got to play it all he wanted.

The week ends and I come back to a very laggy gaming set up. At first I though it was because it was cheap for a gaming set up, then considered it was possibly because my brother downloaded an apk of some game. In the end it was neither.

You see, during this week, my dad told my sister the password and she downloaded the one thing that f*cks up all computers. Roblox.

0,"AITA for getting a colleague fired? | Buckle up. Long Story Time!   


I (22 Year old Female) used to work at a bank as an Audio Visual technician, and our Team Lead left, leaving a spot to fill. Instead of hiring a new Lead, they promoted me, and found a new technician (36 Year old Male, Married, 2 Year old Daughter) to fill my job role. 

As the new lead, I was in charge of training this new tech, who had no prior experience in AV, so I went back to basics, and essentially went real slow with the training and explaining everything fully. I thought I was being careful and considerate by really being thorough, BOY I was wrong. 

We'd gone into the storage room to sort through some old kit that needed to be thrown away. He picked up a bunch of cables, and just threw them straight into the recycle box. I politely asked him why he did that, and he just said they need to be thrown. He hadn't even looked at what cables they were. I've literally turned round and said ""Don't be so ignorant, separate the cables out and test them before you just thrown them away. They could still be useful"". No word of lie, hes gone fucking bonkers at me.. ""Stop talking to me as if I am stupid. I am a 36 Year Old Man, with a respectable job, a loving wife and a 2 Year old daughter. I do NOT need to take orders from a self-involved 22 year old woman who thinks she can boss me round"". Oh boy. I lost the plot. I've only gone and literally shouted at the top of my lungs ""Don't talk to me as if I am a fucking baby"". Safe to say, everyone and their mum heard in the office. 

I took a step back from training him from this point. I couldn't be asked to deal with someone so highly strung that they thought the world evolved round him, so I assigned one of the other AV techs (a man) the task of training him. A couple days later I was approached by this tech and he asked if we could speak privately. He explained to me that this nut job had spent the last few days bitching the hell about me.. ""She's a woman, I don't need to take orders from her. She's young enough to be my daughter. She's stupid. She's blonde. Who the fuck put her in charge"" You name the insult, he said it about me.   


I spoke to my Account Manager and he was moved to Hardware, and a week later, he was removed from site entirely.   


No one ever really confirmed to me whether I was the reason he was removed from site, but a week after he was removed from site I heard that he was raising a complaint about me in the workplace. ""Unfair dismissal"" he said.

0,"AITA for telling someone they can’t bring their emotional support dog into our bakery? | I work in a bakery as a barista. An older man and a woman and two women came in. As I'm helping the women, I notice the older duo has a dog. As I go to say, ""I'm sorry, but we can't allow animals in here,"" I see the dog has a vest and assumed it was a service dog. As I take the drinks out, the dog was standing in the middle of the café; the owners tried to get them to move but the dog didn't move, and I ended up spilling some of a latte trying to get around the dog.

I take their order, and as I'm walking out the drinks I notice they put the dog on the bench so its head is now on the table. Then I see on the vest that the dog is an emotional support animal, not a service animal like I thought. Now I have an ESA, and her letter permits her to go on airplanes and in housing, but not into businesses like service animals can. And in a bakery, it's a major health code violation.

Now I'm in a pickle. They have their food and are eating, so I ask my manager, what do I do? She says don't say anything cause they'll probably complain. I vented about how people can pay scam websites to get illegitimate letters and a vest and are promised you'll be able to take your pet anywhere, and how it makes it harder for people with service animals/legitimate ESAs to be taken seriously. She says that I can say something as they leave.

As they’re leaving, I say in my normal cheery customer service tone, ""hi there, I just wanted to let you know that ESAs aren't allowed in businesses, and I let it slide this time because I thought they were a service animal at first and you had already ordered, but if you bring them next time I'm going to have to ask you to leave."" She says okay and leaves. They stared into the shop as they slowly drove away.

Yesterday, she leaves a review saying it was her father's ESA and they were well-behaved (mind you, the dog didn't listen when asked to come)/clean/leashed, and she was looking forward to coming back until I was blunt and tactless. She said I had seen the dog before they ordered and said nothing, so ""maybe you should have told us that before we spent 30 plus dollars and tipped you."" Leaving out that I first thought they were a service animal. I didn’t do it for the sale, I was ready to ask her to leave as soon as I saw the dog, and frankly she can have her tip back. She said we didn't check up on them - something we don't usually do as a small bakery - smile, or make eye contact, the latter makes me feel shitty because I have anxiety and PTSD which makes eye contact hard for me. I made eye contact with them at least twice each; I probably could have been better, but I was flustered about there being what I thought was a pet, then a service animal, and then an ESA. Not really a good excuse, but I don't necessarily think good eye contact is an end all to good customer service. Other than that, my customer service game is pretty on point.

We had been visiting another country together to visit some extended family. Said family lives in rural villages so takes quite a while to get there from the city.

Anyway, on our way through airport security my sister gets taken aside for a random pat down search... not sure what the proper name is. But my sister refuses as the person is a middle aged guy and she doesn’t want to be “groped by an old man” as she put it. She insists that a female pats her down. The guy explains in broken English that no females are available today and to let him search her, which she continues to refuse. This goes on for about 10 minutes, during which I continually ask my sister to just let him do his job, at which point I simply ask the guy if I can continue on. He says I can, so I apologise for my sister’s behaviour and do so. 

I don’t know what happened after I left, but after about 30 minutes of sitting in the duty free area my sister txts me to come out. She says she was made to leave the security check point and is now being refused entry. I simply replied “I’m not delaying seeing my kids because you couldn’t swallow your pride and let the man do his job. I’m not coming out.”

I immediately thought of this subreddit to come to and vent. (also am on mobile). This will also be very long. 

Some backstory: I've recently turned 16, and my brother 15, when father has recently opened up a cafe, and it has a rustic farmhouse theme, seeing that it is situated in an eco village, and next to a horse riding place (don't know the official word for it). Because of this, there are a RIDICULOUS amount of flies, and many, many rooster calls. The cafe also came with a small piece of land next to it, so he decided to make it a venue for hire for BBQs and parties.
He forced me and my brother to work there from 7 till 7 every day of the week, without a single penny paid to us. Seeing that we started our summer holiday, it was very convenient for him, and not for me and my brother.

Now for the main event.

It started yesterday, and it being a Saturday, I prayed for the 1% chance of me avoiding work, but you can guess how that went. I begrudgently went with my dad to work, and I really wasn't in the mood. At 12 o clock hayfever hit me harder then 911, and my sinuses were as fucked up as Hong Kong's situation. My auntie came over it visit us at work, and immediately noticed (she's like my 2nd mom) and told my dad I'm not fit to work. Like seriously, you could look at my red, snotty face for a split second and see that. My dad on the other hand WA having none of it, and forced me to continue to SERVE customers and wash dishes.
 That night people also rented out to braai ( our version of BBQ) and I was not prepared for that at all. I ended up to staying till 11 at night, in sandals, shorts and a t-shirt. I finally left because my aunt came to pick me and my bro up. (thank you saviot aunt). My dad was really pissed, but I didn't care.

So this morning my dad picked us up, I took some allergex, and we went back to work. After working and napping (like you in classwith your head on the table) till 12, we had lunch. My father told me to eat, but I was tired, so I said no. He warned me again, I didn't respond. 5 minutes later I got up and went to go eat. I cut me some French loaf, and went to eat by myself. Someone (my lazy cousins who visited) then cut for them and made a huge mess, crumbs everywhere, on the counter in which we served customers.
My dad got up, stood in front of it, and said that I must come clean it up NOW. I said nah, I'm busy eating. He lost it. He asked if I don't care that a customer can come in and see this mess, I said of course not, I'm busy eating. He kicked me out and send my off the premises.

My daughter started to learn to cook when she was about 16. By the time she was 17, she was the quite the little chef. She always helped me in the kitchen and got her father and I opened to trying new recipes.

Barely making ends meet, having to utilize government assistance for all of their necessities, rarely having money left over.  Naturally they don't want to go back to that lifestyle at any point.

I'm not wealthy at all.  I grew up poor as well, but now I'm a normal middle class guy.  I'm stable in my career, own my own home, never missed a meal, no bio kids.  The most important things I learned when growing up is the best way to make sure you stay poor when you grew up poor is to have a teenage baby, and to not finish school (at least associates).  So thats what I told the boys.  If you want to be successful in life, the dumbest thing you can do is get somebody pregnant and drop out of school.  When you finally do decide to start a family, make sure the bulk of your education is finished and you have a career...and make sure you know who you're having a baby with so you can marry them and start a life together.

I usually just deal with it because I understand she has a disability and I’m not an asshole but lately she’s been slacking because she knows she can get away with it. My coworkers have told me she won’t do things and say “I don’t have to because OP can just do it tomorrow.”  Lately she’s been skipping things but telling the crew leaders that she’s “finished up early.”

She did it again yesterday when I wasn’t there. Didn’t do about a third of the job and told the crew leader she was finished. So today I called my department manager and told her on her. It’s one thing to not finish because you’re disabled and have problem, it’s another to just be lazy. I’ve come to resent her as a person.

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us.

I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other ""projects"" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

0,"AITA for driving like a maniac on my private drive? | tl;dr - I have a long, private drive on property that I own and I go fast as shit on it. Nosy neighbor came to complain that I am endangering others for speeding. Told him if he didn't leave i'd call the police on him for trespassing. 



Full story. 
So I live in a rural area on the outskirts of the city because I like peace and quiet. We recently got a new neighbor over a month and a half ago and the houses in this area are spread out quite a bit and our house happens to have a very long driveway/street which is on our land. This being a driveway, it has no speed limit signs posted or anything. Our driveway out here is fairly long though. It runs from the main road about a mile and a half to our house.
Our driveway is also fenced. Once you drive off the main road and go through the gate, you're on our driveway.

Now, because we have our own private road basically, I treat it how I want since it's on our land and isn't governed by the city/state etc. This road has now laws so I speed up and down it as fast I can for shits and giggles. It has a few turns so it's fun to whip my little MX-5 about in when I go to the store, work or really just whenever I am coming and going because I find it fun and its not hurting anyone. 

Well apparently our new neighbor across the street has noticed my ""dangerous"" driving. How? I don't know. You basically need binoculars to see your neighbors house because my drive is a mile and a half long and so is his. He came over one day after I got done speeding home from work, banged on my door and told me that I need to stop speeding and driving so recklessly and told me that I could hit someone and how I am endangering others.

I told him that it's my street, on my property which I own and that it's not a through street that just anyone can use because it's a private drive. I also told him there are no posted speed limit signs and that I had no intentions of ever putting one up and that I can't endanger anyone since no one should be driving down my street to begin with. (and there is a gate that's always closed unless I open it or leave it open) Further more if someone is driving down my street it's usually planed and I know they are coming. Lastly, it's not like I am driving up and the driveway all day every day. Only when I am leaving the house or coming home. 

He lost his shit and I told him he needs to fuck off and I will damn well drive how I want to drive on my driveway. So he threatened to call the city and get one of those mobile police traps setup that records speed. I told him that they can't put that on private property and if he would like, I would be happy to call the police to come over right now and have him arrested for trespassing.

I already had the horrible experience living with her mom in our house in Japan before, and ended up being homeless. So I strongly said no to her offer. Also, we couldn't afford her. They got frustrated saying that I was ugly about money, that all I care about is money, and that to me money is more important than family. I straight up told them they were being greedy and selfish, and she was not welcomed in my house. My words can be harsh when I'm pissed off. But I did not get angry for no reason. My husband pulled out from his credit card to send her the money. She came anyways.

Despite disliking it so much, I still opened our door for her and treated her nicely. She got her own room with mattress and warm blanket. I work all day and my boy goes to nursery so she had the house for herself. I only saw her about 3 hours a day, at most. I asked my husband to take her to places. I took her to a nice restaurant on the first day she arrived. I bought extra food and shared with her what I cooked. She was very quiet most of the time. It made me feel pretty awkward. She did help with the dishes and spent a little time with my boy. I said I appreciated for that.

Then on the 3rd day, she started acting out. That morning I heard my husband joking around about the coffee she was struggling to make. It was the first time we brought Japanese coffee so I got curious and asked ""how much was this coffee?"". Right after that she dumped out the coffee in front of my face, stomped into her room, slammed the door and started crying. She said that I hurt her feelings, and that I'm always concerned about money. I got pretty pissed off but did not say anything.

I stopped her right there, told her she was being full of shit and this disrespectful behavior is not accepted in my house. She yelled back then left. Later she came back and cried to my husband about how she tried to run away from her dark life in US but when came here all she got was mean words from me. I stomped out of my room said everybody has their own problem but decent people would try to solve it themselves, not to bring burden to other people's shoulders like what she was doing. She jumped up and down and yelled back at me. We both blew up and threw hurtful words to each other. I asked her to get out of my house. She didn't leave. She apologized. I did not.

0,"AITA for not waiting for my in laws when they were late to my wedding? | This happened a few years ago but it still plays on my mind a lot. 

I got married in a church in the countryside a few years ago. My husband's parents lived in the city and it was a 90 minute drive to the church from their house the morning of the wedding. I was really stressed leading up to it and they come from a different culture where weddings just start when everyone turns up and the time for starting the ceremony isn't as strict. I called my mother in law 3 times before the date of the wedding to discuss the start time and I even had a conversation with her about how the wedding needed to start on time because the priest had another engagement in the afternoon (I'm not sure exactly what it was, could have been anything from a funeral to visiting some parishoners, in any event, the priest was really clear that we couldn't start the wedding late). 

I called my mother in law again twice leading up the wedding - I offered her to go to my parents house beforehand and travel with them. I offered her to go to my husbands house and get ready there. I gave her a map showing where the church was. I asked them if they needed me to explain the directions etc. They declined all these things and said they were fine, they didn't need any help etc. I normally wouldn't have done this but I knew it was an area of the country they weren't familiar with and the priest was putting pressure on me about the start time. 

Anyway, day of the wedding: I turned up to the church. The church is full. All of my husbands family is there, the bridal party, my family. My mother and father in law aren't there. I'm standing there in front of the church, people just awkwardly looking at me from the pews, and everyone is buzzing around saying ""They're late! No one knows where they are! What are we going to do!"" Everyone is trying to call them but they're not answering. The priest is annoyed at us and saying that we need to start the wedding. 

I pushed back the start time again and again and managed to convince the priest to delay the start time by 45 minutes. Forty five minutes pass and I'm still standing around, no sign of them. My husband was freaking out and I said to him ""We probably need to start the wedding soon but they're your parents and you can make the decision whether we wait a bit longer or start."" He made the decision to start and we got married, his parents turned up just before we had the kiss. 

Anyway, people still think it was my fault they missed their son's wedding. His family whisper about it. His parents never once apologised to us. My parents still say it was a ""terrible"" thing that I did. I tend to think it's easier to make it my fault because I'm the daughter in law but this is still a whole thing 3 years later.

When she's unable to do her work, or gets it wrong, I end up being unable to do my work or at least unable to finish it completely because it's missing things from her.

Now, I have the skills to just fill in the missing parts, for example, if she forgets to add an order for our client, I can just do it for her. However, she's relatively new to the job so I figure it's better to tell her she forgot something, and show her how to do it so she won't repeat the mistake later on.

BIG MISTAKE

The interaction is brief, like 5 seconds. This is the first time I've ever corrected her for anything.

Me: Hey Sammy, when we get this request from our client, you have to add this order in.

Sammy: Oh, right...

I hand her the request, she fixes it, and gives it back to me later. No big deal.

Later on, at lunch, my buddy tells me she's been talking shit behind my back. I figure that sucks, screw her then.

Afterwards, she seems to be learning her job well and doesn't make many more errors. The PROBLEM IS she's still talking crap about me behind my back. I have different people telling me to:

1) Leave her alone OR 2) People telling me she's talking crap behind my back.

I go to her and ask if there's anything she wants to say to me. She says no, I ask if she's sure, she says yes, I say alright then.

The shit-talking only intensifies, and apparently I'm harassing her at work now. Drama ensues, only a few people are sticking by me, which kinda makes me sad but at least now I know who I can depend on.

Now comes the day when I see she makes a small mistake but could lead to a large inconvenience for our client. Nothing that would destroy lives but would delay our client's schedule and would make them very unhappy. This mistake went past her, her co-workers, her supervisor, and apparently nobody noticed the problem before it got to me.

So... I send an e-mail to her supervisor about the issue, which is standard protocol but the supervisor is gone for the day and they should (but don't) bother reading their e-mails after they leave.

The next day the client personally shows up and asks about this issue because he arrived in the morning and his people can't get to work because they were missing critical components for their operation.

Our boss smooths things over, gives them a discount on the order, and promises to take care of it himself. The client is satisfied, and leaves with no fuss.

Boss finds out Sammy was the one who made the initial error and fires her, everyone else gets warnings except the supervisor, who said she read my e-mail and was trying to fix the issue. Boss leaves, supervisor thanks me for catching the problem (she probably doesn't realize I could've fixed it myself since it's not actually my job to, and everyone else was too scared to say anything).

My husband obviously can’t do anything without my approval so i’m deciding whether she goes or not. i’m leaning towards not letting her go, i don’t think seeing her lowlife uncle in a casket will bring her closure imo.

1,"AITA for asking my wife where she wants the door of her raised garden to be? | So my wife drops a $1000 on a semi prefabricated garden bed kit, 8' x 12' U shaped.

About a month later, it finally arrives and my son-in-law and I get ready to assemble it. I ask her to show me where she wants it, and we decide on a fairly level piece of ground. I will need to Rototill and level it, then build the garden, looking at a long day of physical labor for this old fat man.

I'm already annoyed that I've wasted over 2 hours in the morning trying to pick up the rototiller I reserved online that no one can find even though their website showed 2 in stock. Ended up having to drive half an hour to another store, with 100 people in line to get in. Fortunately I was able to show the Gate Keeper the transferred pick up order and thy got it to me in 10 minutes.

Back home, already past noon, finish assembling the rototiller...

Ask the wife to show me how she wants the garden situated, where she wants to be able to enter...

ZW: ""OK, show me where you want the door""

Wife: ""I want the corner to be over here...""

ZW: ""The corners don't matter, tell me which side you want the door on and I can lay it out.""

Wife: ""But I want the corners to be...""

ZW: ""The corners DO NOT MATTER, what matters is where you want the door so I can lay it out.""

Wife: ""You don't understand, I need the corners to be...""

ZW: ""For the last fucking time, it DOES. NOT. MATTER. Where you want the corner, it is all built around the door. The door is the critical component. Just show me which direction you want the God Damn door!""

A Wild Daughter appears to defend her Mother

Daughter: ""DAD! Not everyone thinks like you, she's trying to tell you how she wants it...""

ZW: ""This is not rocket science, if she shows me where she wants the door, the rest will fall into place. All I NEED is to know is where she wants the door!""

Mother/Daughter team up on ZW about him being unreasonable and not listening

ZW: (Steam coming out of ears) ""Which part of show me where the fucking door needs to go is so hard to understand?

Wife: ""I don't care anymore, just do it whatever way you want. You never listen, you just do it your way no matter what.""

Considers tossing 25' tape measure at wife but reconsiders

Name calling ensues and women folk decide the correct course of action is to go shopping.

Left to my own devices, I determine the door SHALL be here and stake out an area and break out the laser tape measure, T's and L's to make right angles, spikes and string and other implements of mass destruction and actually get to work.

By the time they get back, the area has been tilled, all the pieces have been laid out, my Son-in-Law has placated the 3 & 6 y.o. to the point he can actually help work on the garden and much progress has been made.

Women folk return form their shopping trip, walk over to where we're working, find nothing to disapprove of and go back inside.",False,False,2,3,2,4,1,3,Authority
0,"AITA For politely refusing to answer questions asked in class by this kid | So basically in my high level maths class i have this kid who is nice and all and i try to be as nice as possible with him
The problem is that he isn’t the best math student 
So when we are solving he asks me a ton of questions including basic concepts
At first i answered everything but this caused me to not be able to finish my exercises and focus in class
Which negatively affected me
Now i just ask him to go to the professor as i need to do my own work and dont really have the time
I dont shout or anything i just ask politely 
Its just very annoying getting asked a question every 2 seconds",False,False,2,3,1,4,1,3,Authority
1,"AITA for breaking my son's tablet? | Kiddo is 9. He was calling me names this morning. No reason - he just thought it was funny. I told him he was hurting my feelings. He didn't stop, so I said if he didn't quit he would be grounded (lose electronics). He called me a loser one more time, so I grabbed the tablet to put it away. He said that he was just going to follow me to see where I put it and take it back. So I purposefully broke it - I smacked it against the counter and handed it back to him. The screen shattered and it is unplayable. 

&#x200B;

One one hand, I feel really bad about it, but on the other hand, I'm kind of glad that it is gone. It has caused so many issues, like staying up late trying to play it, trying to get around the time limits, arguing when we won't let him spend real money on games, etc.",False,False,3,2,1,5,1,4,Authority
