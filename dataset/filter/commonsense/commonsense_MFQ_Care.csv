1,"AITA for moving on after being an abuser | I have had 3 serious girlfriends, now 4. My first relationship was in college and that ended when I went to grad school. I cheated on my grad school girlfriend with my ex. I cheated on my grad school girlfriend with a lot of people. I wasn't ready to be tied down. When she broke up with me, I tried to get her back in any way I could. She says now that this was stalking. I held her down one time and she says that I choked her but I don't remember these things so clearly. I do not think she's lying, I just don't remember how everything went down. That was a very hard break up for me and I didn't date anyone seriously for a long time after that. I was definitely an asshole to other women but nothing too serious. Then I met my third girlfriend. I was an asshole to her at first and I cheated on her but she stuck up for herself and I quickly fell in love with her. We were quite a match made in heaven. But she never seemed to fully trust me. She had very bad anxiety attacks being with me. At first, I started just holding her down but then it became more physical. I ended up bruising her multiple times and then hitting her in her face giving her a black and blue eye. I wanted the relationship to end. When she finally was leaving, a lightbulb turned on in my head and I realized how awful I was treating her. I begged for her back. She took me back but she never could forgive me. She kept breaking up with me and getting back together. I think she became abusive towards me. She became more and more unstable. I still think she is the one that brought out the worst in me. I went to anger management, I'm better now and she finally broke up with me. A week later, I met someone else and we started a relationship. I had pretty much checked out of the old relationship so it's not like I've moved on too fast.

Anyways, I'm doing better in this new relationship. I feel calmer and better and I've learned a lot from my past. I feel bad for how badly I've treated those two girlfriends in my past but I can't be living in the past forever. I've learned and I've grown. I'm sorry they're still hurting. My grad school girlfriend has written articles about abuse and trauma since she's a psychology professor now. She's blocked me from everything. My recent ex, I don't know much about her because she's essentially hidden from me. I tried to contact her to check in on her but she blocked those advances as well. Look, I know what I've done is wrong. I feel guilty about it every single day but I feel better where I am in my life and idk if I'm an asshole for being okay with who I am after everything that I've done.",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,2,Care
0,"AITA for not saying thank you for clothes bought for my daughter? | My mom is angry at me for being rude and not saying thank you for clothes she has bought my 4 year old. 

My daughter is her first and only grandchild and she absolutely adores and spoils her. So much so that we had to ask her to stop keep buying her new toys as we simply don’t have space at home and my daughter really doesn’t need it. 

I ALWAYS say thank you (and actually go out of my way to say extra thank yous as my mom is SO particular with manners) if she looks after my daughter, if we go around for dinner, if she gets something I have asked for it if she gets anything at all for myself. 

My LO stays at her house regularly and quite often she will come home wearing a new pair of shoes or a new sweater — I will always say aw that’s lovely or aw I like these new shoes and will prompt my daughter to say thank you for them. 

This morning, my mom brought my daughter home in a completely new outfit - my daughter is poorly and is throwing a tantrum (quite out of character for her) I’m taking her coat off and my mom asks if I like her outfit- I have a quick response of yeah it’s lovely very cute. I’m honestly not paying too much attention as I have a wave of snot flying my way along with tears and coughs and LO kicking. After she calms down and I’m trying to explain to her she needs to apologise for kicking my mom turns around and says to me.. ‘well you could say thank you.’ At first i was like huh sorry what? She goes on to explain that I should say thank you for the outfit and the last couple of times she has bought something I haven’t actually said thank you for it. 

I was a little thrown off and was a bit surprised ... I always show appreciation for what she gets for my daughter by saying oh it’s lovely ect but I do realise I don’t actually say thank you.

But part of me is thinking like it’s not for me, it’s for my daughter who is old enough to understand and appreciate new things and I always encourage her to say thank you. I never ask for these new things nor do we need them, my daughter has plenty and is never in need of anything. My mum literally buys them because she likes them and wants them for my daughter, it’s not as though she is buying them to help me out. Although I appreciate her buying them for her, I didn’t realise I had to outright say thank you for them!

1,"AITA for spraying my wife in the face with the bottle we use to keep the cats off the counter? She was really, really annoying me. | So despite the title of this post, my wife and I have a really great relationship. We have been married for 3 years now and get along really great. 

However she is an incredibly intense personality and when she gets something on her brain, she almost is stymied from doing or thinking about anything else. Right now she wants to start looking at buying a house. She must look at Zillow and various real estate websites 100 time a day and she is constantly looking at houses and she's always sticking her phone in my face saying ""I love this one so much"" and then want to have an in depth conversation about everything form how we'll afford it to how she wants to decorate it. 

The reality is unless we absolutely stretch, we can't afford a house for a few more years so to me, it's not the urgent rush that she's making it. 

I had a terrible day at work yesterday. I had to fire a really nice guy who really needed the job but had just screwed up way too many times. It really ate at me all day long and I wanted to get home, eat a frozen burrito over the sink and then put my headphones on and rock out to bad 80/90s pop music. 

As soon as I stepped through the door my wife shoved her phone in my face and started going on and on about how she found the perfect house in the historic district she loved and she'd talked to the agent and we needed to start getting our financing together (say that at the speed of a cracked out chipmunk trying to get laid and add a thousand more words and you can sort of see how she was acting). I told her I'd had a really bad day and just didn't have the brain power to process anything that wasn't realistically going to happen. 

I went to heat up my burrito and she just kept pestering me. I told her several times that I just needed a break. She kept at me so I finally told her I couldn't talk about this tonight and please leave me along. She just kept at it but started mixing in things about how I'm ruining her dreams and the real estate agent told her that if we didn't act today this house was going to be gone. She just wouldn't listen to me so I picked up the spray bottle (full of water) we use to squirt the cats and sprayed her right in the face. 

She got understandably pissed and hasn't spoken to me. At first I felt like I'd done the right thing because I got a little breathing room. But she is still not speaking to me and while she slept next to me I could feel her moving around all night and huffing and puffing like she was really mad.

1,"WIBTA for apologizing to a girl after I was told to stop contacting her? | Here's the situation: I met this girl on a dating app and things started off fantastically. We had incredible chemistry and would text all day and meet up when we could and there was clearly strong mutual interest. She was moving out of town, however, so after a couple weeks we talked about what we were looking for and she wasn't interested in either enjoying things while they lasted or trying to do long distance, while I was. I pushed too hard in trying to convince her of my point of view and she told me to stop contacting her- this is what I feel bad about.

Then the other day (a couple months after we last communicated) I was on the dating app we met through and her profile appeared. For better or worse I sent a message saying sorry I was an asshole for not accepting her answer and that I would resume no contact. I know for sure that the situation is that she deleted the app from her phone but her profile still exists (which is why I saw it in my area and it had no changes from when we initially matched) so she will never see that message.

Now, I’m tempted to text her and say that I was thinking about her because her profile popped up and had actually apologized but that after realizing she wouldn't see that apology I wanted to apologize more directly

0,"AITA For refusing to let my friend lump me in with her mental illness? | Hi. I have OCD. It's really bad, and it affects like life in tons of ways. One of those ways is that I have a lot of rituals involving food, but nothing related to how much I can eat, what I specifically can eat, and some other things. It's really just one of many, but it's definitely one of the most prevalent and noticeable sets of rituals that I have. 

One of my friends is in treatment for an eating disorder. We were talking about our various *things* and she brought up that I should come with her to support group/group therapy for people with eating disorders. I thanked her for the sentiment, but said such a group would not be helpful at all to me, because I don't have an eating disorder, I have disordered eating due to a completely separate mental illness. Treatment for specific eating disorders would not be helpful to me, because it would not in any way address the underlying cause of my weird eating. 

She insisted that any time a person can't eat exactly how and what they want, they have an eating disorder, and I said this just wasn't the case. I don't have body dysmorphia, I don't have a poor relationship with food, and if I treated the OCD, the food stuff would go away, just like the touching stuff, the counting stuff, etc. 

She got SUPER offended and wanted to know why I wouldn't consider it at all, why I was refusing to acknowledge that I have an eating disorder, and I just said it's similar to if we both had high blood pressure due to different causes, and she wanted me to take medicine for that treated her cause, but did absolutely nothing for mine. She said it's nothing like that, and didn't even like the comparison to a physical illness. 

She kind of tried to get some of our mutual friends involved, but most of them won't touch it. I still insist that being treated for an eating disorder would just not be helpful to me.

We did sell the property, and kept the money in a safe account that can be used for the kids when they needed it, or until they could legally handle it on their own.

My eldest daughter (28) wanted her full share for a house, my son (19) wanted his for his schooling, and my younger daughter (23) used about 80% of hers for her wedding. 
My wife and I didn’t think she should use so much of on a one day event, especially because she also has mentioned that she does want to own property as well so it would of been better off going towards a down payment. But She insisted, so that’s what she did. 

My youngest recently came to us and told us that she wants the remaining money and that she is planning on getting a breast augmentation with it. 

My wife and I think this a ridiculous idea and a complete waste of money. She has this crazy notion when she was a teenager as well, but we figured she would have grown out of it.

0,"WIBTA if I didn’t let my daughter go to Disney World? | A little backstory.. My daughter, we will call her M, just turned 5. Her dad and I split a little over 3 years ago, but the last year and a half or so of our marriage we were really just roommates and he didn’t have much to do with M or me. Since then I have remarried and we have a 1yo son as well that M adores. After the split M’s dad moved into an apartment with roommates about 20 minutes from us. She was to spend every Wednesday and ever other weekend with him. This only lasted a month. Then he suddenly couldn’t have her on Wednesday’s anymore, then he couldn’t have her on Friday’s either. And then she ended up going to her paternal grandparents every other weekend and her dad would “visit” her there for a couple of hours Saturday and/or Sunday. (He would mostly be playing on his phone or watching TV while his mother took care of M. I know this from his sister) Then in April of last year M’s dad moved 8 hours away and rarely sees her anymore (he came to visit for Christmas and then her birthday in May and probably won’t be back until thanksgiving or Christmas). When he visits he stays with his parents and M stays there too so they can spend the most amount of time together possible. However he only gets to spend about 3 days here when he comes to visit and a VERY small portion of that is actually spend with M. He is more worried about hanging out with old friends etc. He originally said he was going to call her daily, but he calls once a month if she is lucky. 

Now to the dilemma. M’s dad wants to take her to Florida (9ish hours from us) for a week and take her to Disney world. He KNOWS that I love Disney and have been looking forward to taking her basically since I found out I was pregnant. 

I do not feel comfortable with her going as she barely knows him and he has shown on several occasions that he isn’t exactly fit to be a father (example: when he lived here with roommates M got sick one time while spending the night there and her dad WOKE UP his female roommate and asked her to give M a shower and clean her off because he wasn’t sure what to do. M also told me that when she woke up early in the mornings her dad would tell her to go get said female roommate instead and let him sleep).

1,"AITA for pressuring my SO to quit her job? | My SO and I have been together for more than a decade. We are childless, unmarried, and unburdened by debts, so the only reason we have to stay together is because we want to be.

She's a cook and is currently working for some relatives' organization on a gig-by-gig basis. She cooks all meals for groups of people that stay temporarily in a place run by them. Sometimes it's for a couple of days, sometimes it's more than a week, with varying frequency: she might do nothing in two months, and then have 3 gigs in a row.

She loves this job. She has free reign, and it was tailored for her. She even helped designing the kitchen. At first it was only her but now she has an assistant she's become pretty closed to. She has made friends among the organization as well. It also came at a time when we had money issues so we were grateful for it.

There is, however, a series of problems. First of all, her place of work is very far away so she has to stay there for the duration of each job. Which wouldn't be an issue if not for the fact she doesn't have a regular place to stay. Sometimes there's a room available in that place but if not she has to crash somewhere, suitcase in toll. Which could be fixed if not because it's not a well-paid job so we can't afford her own place there.

There are two much bigger issues, though. One, my SO has a physical condition that makes her tired most of the time. She still can work but so much moving around is pushing it. Each time she comes back from a job she stays longer in bed, and she's close to maxxing her meds. And two, this job is straining our relationship. As I said we are together because we want to be together, and yet this thing is keeping us apart sometimes for almost full months at a time. I not only never wanted a long-distance relationship but also living alone makes me anxious and ultimately affects my health, all of which she knows.

Before someone asks, moving there is not an option. Right now we live in a decent apartment of a mid-sized city, I have a full-time job, and we are close to all services and doctors we need for our conditions. She works in a small town in the middle of nowhere with very few job prospects for me, limited rental options, and far from specialized care centers. None of us want that.

I've made myself very clear I want her to quit for both our sakes. She agrees with me but says she doesn't want to leave them in the lurch, so she has volunteered to find and train a replacement. However, not only nobody has looked for any candidates yet, she has also already agreed to do more jobs for the next sixth months. I understand she has a hard time with this because she likes it there, and she doesn't want conflict with her relatives who, after all, gave her the job. However, at the end of the day it is not her company or her responsibility, and any moral debt has been sufficiently paid, so I'm pressuring her to give a very short notice and leave.

I love my girlfriend and I love going on holiday with her. HOWEVER I've recently been asked by a friend if I want to go travelling with them for a few months. My girlfriend isn't happy because in the past she has suggested this and I haven't been keen.

I don't care for my own safety anywhere near as much as I care about hers and if anything happened to her while travelling I know I would never forgive myself, even if it wasn't directly my fault or I couldn't have prevented it.

I'm usually the one who remains calm and composed in unusual or frightening situations and TBH I like that role (it makes me feel valued) but while travelling around areas that I feel I would already be slightly anxious I think it might ruin it if I had to feel anxious for both me and her.

My parents just called me downstairs to ask if I could reschedule my surgery. My brother (who is severely disabled) has something going on with his leg (I’m not exactly sure what, but it isn’t serious enough for the emergency room, they just want a regular doctors visit). My brothers doctor had May 3rd open and May 8th.

I told them I wouldn’t reschedule, seeing as I need my tonsils out and I also need more than a week of recovery before the black belt test.

0,"AITA for complaining to management about the aesthetician? | I'm not a big complainer, but I do believe that if a service isn't great and someone asks me how it was, I'll be honest with them as politely as possible.

I had a facial earlier this week. I went in for dry skin and exfoliation. That's it. Nothing else. I've had maybe three other facials in my life, and IME I received constructive feedback on how to care for my skin. I get that it's not a compliment session, it's for the purposes of skin care. But this week's experience was really negative. I was asked to get there early to fill out paperwork, which required a detailed list of my skincare products, and my history (Have I smoked? No. Have I gone tanning? No. etc...). I filled all of it out in detail. 

The aesthetician who worked with me obviously didn't read it because she proceeded to ask me all the questions on the form. Okay, fine. She hadn't heard of the company that makes my skincare stuff. I mentioned I ordered online and she said ""oh well that's terrible, you can't trust anything you buy online."" Oookay. Then she says ""You used to tan?"" I said no, and she said ""really??"" I said no. I'm a pale lady with freckles, it's just my skin type. I wear sunscreen daily. She proceeded to ask me ""what are you doing about these lines in your forehead"" and then asking me what my heritage was to see if it could explain ""all the sun damage."" I don't actually have a lot of sun damage, but I do have freckles. I have pretty healthy skin overall, but I do not tan and I tend to have dry skin. She said everything in a really demanding tone. I explained that I'm actually okay with having a few lines, and that I've had freckles since I was a kid. I probably sounded upset because she immediately started to apologize and then didn't talk much after that. It was not a relaxing experience at all. She did an okay job at the actual facial, she just had no customer service skills. 

On the way out, I was asked how it was. I told them that I did not think the aesthetician was a good fit for me. They asked me to elaborate and I said it was because she was a bit pushy and aggressive in her way of interacting. I told them I didn't want to cause her any trouble, but that if I come back I didn't want to work with her, and that's all. I left her a 5% tip, since she did actually complete the service, she was just really unpleasant to work with. 

The owner called me later and said that I wasn't the first to complain and said that they would offer me a discount if I decide to come back. I thought that was nice of them, but it also made me wonder if I'm just being a bitch. On one hand, I'm mad that I spent money on something that was supposed to be pampering and I just left feeling upset.

1,"AITA for trying to keep my stepdaughter from her formerly drug-addicted bio mom? | A few years ago, I became a stepmom to a girl I love very much. She was in her pre-teens when I met her and now she’s 16. I love everything about her and doing everything with her, even when it’s hard and we disagree on certain things. 

I worried so much about not being able to love her like “my own” despite not having any bio kids (and not wanting any), but whenever I go to her soccer games or dance concerts I feel that I feel the same pride that the other parents in the crowd/on the bleachers feel. I love being able to snuggle with her and talk to her about her day on weekends (since my her dad/my husband isn’t a morning person at all haha), and I love that I can be there for her when she needs me, especially now that school is out for me and her (I am a teacher). 

I honestly hope she feels the same way about me.

However, her biological mom has come back into the picture recently. She got addicted to drugs after extensive surgery for health problems when my daughter was 3 but has told my husband and I that she’s getting into rehab to get better and wants to see her kid again whenever it's a better time to do so, given her condition and what we have going on now. 

But honestly, I’ve been telling my husband I don’t want our kid to see her bio mom, and cited incidents from earlier years where the BM would get sober, reach out, and do 1-2 nice outings with our daughter before spiraling back into drugs again, hurting her in the process. 

Granted, it’s been 3-4 years since she did that, and her bio mom does seem like she has changed for the better (has a job again that pays pretty well, is going back to school for a masters, etc.)

However, the real reason, which I’ve told no one, except for my husband, subtly, is that I feel concerned that my stepdaughter won’t love me as much after she reunites with her bio mom though I’ve said I’d support her regardless of what happens. Even if it hurts. 

Everyone says that the biological connection is super unique and powerful and I’m worried that I’ll lose her when her BM comes back into her life, assuming that her BM has changed and wants to love and care for her. I get that I’m not her mom, but I’ve cared for and loved her through the pre-teen and teen years. I'm going to feel devastated if I lose her.

Unfortunately enough, my MIL (we are clearly best friends /s) has also picked up on my behavior and is nagging my husband about how evil I am to have kept her from her BM.

0,"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to befriend the girl who bullied me for months? | I used to be friends with a girl in my class. We were quite close sometimes, and even tho we were very different I once considered her to be a close friend.

And... Well then I met my boyfriend. And when we told her... She ignored me that whole day. And well, the cold shoulder eventually vanished and turned into a cold ""friendship"" where I had to hide everything about my boyfriend, or else she would get pissed. If I was hanging out with my boyfriend, she got pissed. If I kissed my boyfriend or anything, she would look disgusted. As if I was doing a horrible crime.

This just continued for months. It felt like it would never stop. I was walking on eggshells to not make her mad. Whenever I tried to talk with her about it, she would say that I overreacted and call me dramatic.

She would talk shit about me to both our shared friends and others. This put our friends in quite a uncomfortable position, and I'm sorry that our problem dragged them in.

Eventually I just got tired. I was mentally exhausted and I just couldn't hang out with a ""friend"" who hated my relationship. All of the hatred and coldness was against me. Never my boyfriend. They used to be friends before our relationship.

I cut her off, and I didn't talk to her for months. Then she came to me and apologized, and I accepted it. (She stopped hating my relationship when she got a boyfriend of her own.) Ever since she's been nice to me, but we never really became friends again. She was just... There. Okay, but never friends.

And... Now my boyfriend told me that he was going to her house. I followed, but... Well, it didn't really feel good. I hadn't been to her house for... Like, a year.

He asked me why I looked sad, and I asked him how long we were going to be there. He got a little bit annoyed and said that I wouldn't appreciate it if he had this attitude about my friends that he didn't like.

We (me, my boyfriend, the girl and her boyfriend) just sat and talked about cars for a while. It went okay, she's nice and all... But I don't know. I'm still a bit nervous around her.

My boyfriend and her has been snaping all throughout the day. He told me that he wants to befriend her again. And I kind of just smiled and nodded.

I... Kind of don't want him to do that. I don't know why, but it feels like walking into the same trap again.

I'm also a bit surprised that he wants to be friends with someone who made several months of my life a living hell. Sure, she's nicer now but I feel like there are better people out there one could be friends with.

But, well, it is his choice after all. I just don't feel good about it. I wish he didn't want to have her as a friend. And I kind of feel bad about that. I know that he's obviously allowed to be friend with anyone... But I just wish it wasn't her. I haven't said anything about it to him.

Before we used to spend alot of time together, she used to spend a couple of days at mine and I would stay over hers a few days a week as she has the bigger apartment due getting lucky with a job offer straight from school, possibly a cause of who you know rather than what you know....

Earlier today we were video chatting like we do every day at the moment, kelsie has been calling less since she is still working from home from her laptop.

Today I noticed she looked tired and asked if she's getting enough sleep, she said yes but only because of ( random youtuber) I asked to check our the channel so she linked me.

It's just a random YouTube guy that films nature audio and scenery, like rain falling or one if a snowy mountain wind sounds.

I noticed in his description that he asks for donations to his channel wich I thought was hilariously bad, like he's filming mountain streams on his hikes and expects money for that!?

Kelsie argued that she uses his videos to sleep every night as he has 24 7 live rain videos and a bunch of 12 hour audio stuff.

Then she dropped the real bomb, as I'm laughing at the guy for begging for money on the internet she says that she has donated $50 over the last 4 months to this fucking simp.

I asked her if shes speaking to the guy who makes the videos and she said not exactly, she said he emailed her thanking her for the donations the 2 times she donated, wich makes that a blatant lie.

emailing is talking too, she also attached notes to her donations wich I asked to see.

In the notes she thanks him for the videos and sings them praise for curing her chronic insomnia.

Kelsie has prescribed sleeping pills for insomia, she absolutely doesn't need to be spending money on this random guy on YouTube.

Shit hit the absolute fan anyway because kelsie must have called her dad to intervene and he called me and told me to fuck off away from kelsie and called me controlling.

Unbeknowst to me, Julie has also offered to supply weed in the past, although Elise has never accepted before.

I have a three year old niece. When my sister went back to work after her daughter was born, the whole family kinda pitched in the help with childcare so they didn’t have to use a daycare. Her mother in law and our mother each looked after her for a few days a week. Eventually, with my extreme reluctance, I was rope in to help babysit maybe a total of seven day a month, sometimes more. Some of those day were super long, like eight hour days and I did this for about a year and a half. Somehow I become my niece’s favorite person during this time.

1,"AITA for asking my GF to come home after working an event in the city? | Gf (39F) and I (35M) have been together for about a year and a half. We live apart and spend nights together when we can. Unfortunately, we end up spending most nights apart. We have both said we don't like this. However, being busy professionals, we deal with it.

GF got a new job in the spring as a project manager for a shipping association. She's been putting together industry events, organizing tours for various ships, etc. These events almost always occur away from our home city. Some of them are quite far away (travel by plane), but others have been in driving distance (around an hour).

On the occasion that the event has been closer, I've asked if she could consider staying at home or if I could drive up and stay with her. She's always refused. Her reasoning is that she's going to be way too busy with work, and will just be crashing at the hotel (or place she's staying).

Recently, an event she was organising came up in our city. Two weeks before it, she let me know that she would be staying at the event site. I asked her why, as the city transit goes there, and all together we're talking maybe 30-35 minutes door to door. I got the usual response. I asked if I could come and stay with her, she said no. I dug further and asked about the plans in the evening. The first night she says she'll be working late setting up, but then her portion will finish, so she doesnt need to worry about tear down. I ask her why is she staying there for an additional two nights, then? It comes out there are social events those nights. Events I'm not invited to. I say fine, doesn't feel great, but then can she please just come back home after the parties rather than stay at the site? She says no, she has to be back at the event in the mornings.

I got upset.

I pointed out it takes longer for me to get to work from her apartment than it would for her to get to the event, and yet I do this all the time. I pointed out that none of this is a reason I couldn't come stay with her. I pointed out she could just leave the social portion before it was 2AM and get a good night's sleep if she wanted. I pointed out we dont spend that much time together as is. I pointed out I am NEVER (not an exaggeration) invited to anything to do with her new job, when I am very conscientious to invite her to everything in the hopes she'll make it.

Her response was to question why I can't just support her, and that this is what she feels she needs to be successful. I told her I would like to support her but these decisions seem less about work and more about socializing and convenience and they don't make me feel valued in the relationship. I told her she needs to be more open to compromise.

0,"AITA for asking the sleep technicians at my sleep study to not be so loud? | I had a sleep study performed this past weekend.

Unfortunately, my room was connected to the lab that the technicians sat in during the night. The wall was not sound proof and I could hear everything. They were laughing and talking really loud. A couple of hours went by and they were not showing signs of settling down. At this point, not only was the noise keeping me awake, my irritation was keeping me up too. I could not believe that they would be making so much noise in a *sleep* lab! If I couldn’t fall sleep, I didn’t know how and if I would be able to do a re-do. At this thought, I finally spoke up and said into the room “excuse me? I’m hearing a lot of noise in the hall and am having a really hard time falling asleep.” (They have a camera and microphone in there so all you have to do is talk for your tech to hear you.” 

She said “be right in.” 

She came in and asked what she could do for me. I asked if they maybe had ear plugs or something. I didn’t want to directly blame them for talking too loud. They didn’t have ear plugs but she brought in a fan to help cancel out the noise. 

As she was getting ready to leave she said in an irritated tone, “You should’ve tried to go to sleep earlier.” The rule was that everyone had to have lights out by 11. I hadn’t been sleep when I came in for my study so I stayed up until the last minute before I fell asleep. I wish she had said something to me about going to bed earlier. All she told me was the rule was everyone in bed by 11.

0,"AITA for snapping at my boyfriend for calling several times in a row? | One thing that annoys me is that my boyfriend tends to call multiple times in a row when I don't answer for whatever reason. He does this with his parents too- if he wants to chat, he'll call his dad's cell phone, his mom's cell, the house phone, and then repeat before giving up. He does this pretty frequently, and I've told him off at several points throughout our relationship for giving me a heart attack when I see 4 missed phone calls just because he was bored.

Today, I was on the phone with my dad, and I get a phone call from my boyfriend. I'm in the middle of the conversation with my dad, so I let it go to voicemail thinking I'll call him back in a few when I'm off the phone. Two minutes later, my phone starts buzzing again, so I interrupt my dad mid-sentence and say, ""Hey, boyfriend's calling again- something must be wrong, let me answer this"".

&#x200B;

I immediately say, ""What's wrong? Is everything okay?"" And my boyfriend's just like, ""Hey, what's up"". I got mad and told him that I was on the phone with my dad, and I got scared thinking something was wrong. I ended up snapping at him to respect the fact that if I don't answer the phone right away, it means I'm busy and calling several times just conveys a false sense of urgency that I need to stop what I'm doing and answer his phone call. He very defensively said that he just wanted to talk to me and basically acted like I was jumping all over him for no reason.

I've made it clear that while we can always do things, anything bigger (I.E. something outside of town) I want to wait till I have my son so he can go with. She has always obliged in the 3+ years we've dated.

My GF wants to take her daughter and me to Calloway Gardens this weekend. Despite living fairly close, I've never actually been and neither has my son. So I don't really know what to expect there. I told her that if we postpone it a week until I have my son, I would enjoy the trip more. I have a harder time enjoying things if I'm thinking ""My son would have liked this, I wish he was here with us."" 

&#x200B;

This set her off quite a bit. I understand to some level. It does make planning trips harder because we have to wait till weekend that she doesn't have to work, and we have my son. Her exact words were, paraphrased ""It's starting to hurt my feelings, everything revolves around your son \[being here\] and it's like my daughter isn't as important. He's at the beach having fun with his mom, so my daughter should get to have fun this weekend too."" I conceded that is a good point, but I would rather wait if we could because I honestly can't enjoy it as much wishing he were with us.

So she un-invited me on the trip. 

(Which brings up a whole other bag of emotions with me, because she goes off on this single mom tirade, and I tell her that if her daughter doesn't see me as a father at this point, it's because my GF treats me as though I'm the optional member of the family. To be fair that's probably not 100% accurate or fair. I could definitely try harder but it feels like there's so many walls up with my GF, I'll never really be allowed to have that role.)

0,"AITA for hiding the fact that I switched careers from my parents? | To give some context, I’m a senior in college and was pre-med/neuroscience up until last year. I tried applying to med schools last cycle and didn’t get in. I decided to add a fifth year to add a psychology major in order to boost my gpa and apply again. I fell in love with psychology and decided to apply to a grad program in psych. It’s truly my passion and what makes me happy. I debated telling my parents but I decided against it because I have a mother that criticizes everything and makes me feel bad about everything I do. She’s never been nice about anything good I’ve done and I always end up feeling stupid after telling her about it. To counteract this, I hide all of my accomplishments from my parents so that I don’t feel bad about them. 

I wanted to avoid getting my feelings hurt because I even heard back from the program. I’m extremely sensitive and I know if she tried hard enough she could make me hate the program that I was super excited about applying to. Because of this, I couldn’t tell my father either out of fear that he would convince me to tell her or tell her himself.

A few days ago I found out that I got in and I was so happy! This is a passion of mine and I feel so content and comfortable. I decided to tell my parents that night and the first thing my mom said was that she would never be happy with it and neither would my father. She then proceeded to make fun the grad program and told me it was nothing to be excited about. Then she told me that I only switched because I didn’t think I would be able to make it through med school. My dad was quiet through all of this.

I told him that I didn’t want to be discouraged before I even got in and he told me that it wouldn’t have happened (even though I knew it would...and it did). He really guilted me for not telling them but I was just protecting my heart and self-esteem. My mom has been going off about it for days and is standing firm in the belief that she wasn’t wrong for the things she said and that it was just parental concerns.

I asked her does she wants pancakes or is there anything I can do for. After that I started kissing her-just soft pecks, hoping it would make her feel better. After this nothing really changed again. She said she needs tissues (as she was crying) and told me that she would tell me what's wrong when I got her some tissues. I gave her a full roll of toilet paper and she said she doesn't want it. I said keep it because we have loads in the bathroom. She dismissed me.

 I then went over to her and she started saying that I am so vain and that I don't care about her because she said that she would tell me what's wrong after I got her tissues. I did get distracted honestly, but that doesn't mean I don't care about her. I do care and told her while hugging her. She started calling my vain again whilst I tried to explain to her what I was doing, but she was still pissed. 

As she got more upset/angry/attacking/ I moved away from her and as I did, I saw two  wet snotty tissues on the bed, with the scary coronavirus I'm trying to promote healthy hygiene habits, so as I picked them up with thumb and finger I said something like ""babe you must put your tissues in the bin"".

0,"AITA for making my friend use my chosen name for me? | Hi, folks.

I have this friend of mine. He's always been a good friend, and he is probably one of the most important people in my life.

Recently, I have gathered the courage to ask that my friends call me by a chosen name. My legal name is pretty, but it really doesn't connect with me. My chosen name I have been using for myself for nearly 4 years, I have been writing and drawing under this name, and most online friends know me by it. Needless to say, I am very comfortable with my choice.

I started by telling 3 of my closest friends. One of them is trans, so the reaction was exactly what I expected. The other one is kind of hard to read,  but she took it surprisingly well, going ""you're my friend, and I will try my best to use your new name"", which made me really happy. I expected a similar reaction from him as well.

The reality was different, though. He said that I picked a nice name, but he will still use my old one, since it is weird to him that my name would differ from the one in my passport. He then said I should get it legally changed, otherwise, he won't do it. ""Make it legal"" was his answer to everything, as it would prove I am ""serious enough"" about this name. I was severely hurt by this for several reasons:
1) where I live, there's only about 6 cases where you'd be permitted to change your name, and ""I want to"" is not one of them, so, unless I move somewhere else, it is not a possibility.
2) even if it was, it's a major hassle and expense that I cannot afford right now, both mentally and financially.
3) my legal and chosen names being different is really not an issue for me - after all, it's not like my friends file paperwork for me, and I don't have to use my legal name for things all that often. After all, it is not a problem for him to use nicknames for other friends. He also doesn't ask any new person to show them their ID, lest the names differ and makes it, as he says, ""weird"".

It is very possible that I overreacted, as it seemed like he couldn't be bothered to accomodate a reasonable enough need for a friend. We parted ways being very upset, and we haven't spoken since, and it's been bothering me, as I told him he better gets used to my new name. I plan to change it on my social media profiles eventually, and stop responding to my old one.

Am I the asshole here? To me, it seemed a reasonable enough request, as I cannot think of a single reason why anyone would refuse to use a name that a person has given them. As somebody who has done this before, it takes some time, and I wouldn't blame anyone for slipping up, but I would like my friends to put some effort into switching to it.

0,"AITA for sticking by my autistic wife? | Bit of a backstory.

My wife is autistic, and has a lot of rigidity issues. Shes heavily routine oriented, and can often get very overwhelmed when something messes up her schedule.

I messed up her schedule.

My buddy and I planned a camping trip, and went for it. My wife, obviously and quite understandably, was having a very hard time with it, being as I'm literally ALWAYS home after work, and me being completely gone for 4 days was a HUGE break in routine for her. So there was a heavy emphasis on being home when I say I'm going to be home.

Now, my friend is one of those guys who buys a 20 year old vehicle, and drives it likes it's a brand new really car. Just ratbags the shit out of things. He had recently gotten a rather old truck, and sure enough, he beat the hell out of it so badly that the exhaust pipe sheared clean off of the muffler. So he was all ""well if you wanna make it home on your 'schedule' youd better call someone."" So that's exactly what I did. Tbh, I think he was expecting me to stay for a few extra nights while he figures out where to get his exhaust fixed. (Worth noting this happened on the day before Canada Day and no place was going to be open for a few more days).

So I call my brother, and he saves our asses. In the 3 hours it took for him to get to us, we managed to redneck rig the exhaust back on to the truck, and we decide to just limp it home and hell get it fixed in a few days. The thing was running like shit but we got her home.

Fast forward 2 days.

Hes been to a muffler shop, and got a really awesome new exhaust manifold installed. I made it home to my wife ahead of schedule, and everyone was doing fine. Until he goes to drive it away and it's still running like shit. A few hours in an engine repair shop later, and he finds out the horrible truth: he has cooked his engine. The thing is just dead. He castrated the poor thing. Understandably, he was a bit upset. That's where the ""WITA"" part comes in.

(This was a month ago so I'm paraphrasing)
Him - So the motor in the truck is fucked. But at least we got you home for YOUR schedule right?(make sure to read that in a snarky shitty voice)

Me - I'm sorry about that man. But that was a pretty shitty thing to say.

Him - (still in that shitty way) You're right. I've been biting my tongue for a long time now but I guess I'll just bite it some more.

A couple days later the stove was going with a pot and I sent another text. They said “I know, I’ll be back in half an hour.” 

I said I couldn’t watch it and had to be leaving myself. They said it was fine to leave it on. That’s unsafe and I was definitely not going to walk out and wait for the house to burn down. I said “I’m turning this off when I leave.” 

They said they’d be back in 20 minutes and it wasn’t a big deal. I had no way of knowing whether that was true or not. Especially considering they’d already been gone two hours. I didn’t doubt them because they’re disingenuous, just because things come up. Traffic, passing the supermarket and realizing you need something, getting caught up in a phone call, whatever. In the time it took to do any of those, a fire could start. 

I turned it off. This resulted in a long and heated (no pun intended) argument about fire safety when they got back. They said it was ridiculous for them to have to stay home when something is just baking or simmering and doesn’t require anything attention.

She could easily choose to work in a bigger city or anywhere really with her level of talent however my field of work is rather limited on locations so we live in a smaller area that limits her opportunities. She also makes less working here in one of the few upscale restaurants in our area but the cost of living is lower too. 

Between the two of us, we make decent money but we are both paying off student debt and other accumulated debt. Plus we are planning on taking a cruise at the end of this year that I want us to save to make sure we have a cushion for the trip. Adding to all of this I've implemented a workout and diet regiment for the two of us so we can tone up/trim down for our trip. My GF is not overweight by any means but she's always complaining that her body isn't as toned as she would like and I think between toning along with losing ten lbs she would be a knockout on the cruise hopefully in her own mind as much as she is in mine. 

So I have been suggesting because of all of these reasons we should stop going out and just eat at home. It's cheaper in the long run. She's just as good if not better than any place we could go to our surrounding area. We can also better stick to the diet and eat healthier in general. But she's been pushing back against this saying she spends most of her day cooking at work and though she doesn't mind cooking occasionally at home (for her this means 2-3 times a week depending on her work schedule) she doesn't to do it all the time. As she out it if you came home and just continued to do what you do at work all the time are you really getting any time off? 

She has said there are other ways we can save money and by doing it this way she's the only one really making the sacrifices of enjoyment in the relationship. Because of all this she feels I'm being a total AH here and that she won't get a proper date night ever again or a nice night out on the town if she cooks all our meals.

0,"AITA For not attending a traditional thanksgiving dinner with my family, though they want me to? | I love my family and I also love family gatherings, but I hate Thanksgiving. I find my family to be whiny, difficult, unhelpful, manipulative and generally exhausting on that day. Very few people participate in the planning and creation of the meal. The men don’t participate at all and when you finally get to the table someone is always upset because this year you made the cranberry sauce from scratch instead of pouring it out of a can or put real mushrooms in the casserole. I’m sure many people attend delightful culinary repasts where great memories are made, but to me its a day of drudgery and emotional minefields. 

The second-to-last time I attended my stepmother was dying from an awful disease and my father from 2 kinds of cancer. The meal was to be over at my sister‘s house and the family was supposed to come back to my house to play games, since the older generation could not travel. Thursday morning I dragged my poor SM into her special chair and hauled her into the living room so she would be ready when guests arrived. I prepared a full traditional meal for my dad and my BF, who stayed with my parents, and then I went to my sister‘s house. I hung out for a little, ate the meal and left. After all, there were people at my house who also needed to be fed. No one came back to my house. My SM waited all day and no one came over. Im so angry about it that even now it’s making me teary. My sister‘s response, “oh I didn’t think the plans were firm.“ Then she went on to tell me that her son (10 at the time) cried in his room beclause I left so suddenly. My step-brother didn’t even bother to comment. He was a ghost the entire time his mom was sick.

I‘m still pretty upset about it because it was just the icing on the cake of a year in which I felt abandoned by my siblings, while I cared for our parents.

Fast forward 5 years and my sister is repeatedly asking me to come over. She just texted me again with guilt about the kids wondering why I won’t come over. At this point I just answer that I’m not coming because I don‘t want to. I’m 51 years old and I know what I want and it‘s to be left in peace on that day. FWIW I do go to other family gatherings.

1,"AITA for gettin annoyed that my wife keeps locking the deadbolt to our house | I only have hand, and our front door’s lock doesn’t quite work right.

I can’t turn the key while pulling on the door at the same time. The back door has the same problem. 

My wife keeps locking the deadbolt when she leaves to pick up my daughter from school violin or basketball. I typically get home around 5 minutes after she leaves, and it takes her around half an hour to pick up my daughter. 

This means that I’m either stuck outside for half an hour, or I have to pull on the door with my right hand and try and turn the key by mashing it with my elbow. Doesn’t work terribly well. I’ve been telling my wife for almost a year to stop locking the deadbolt. I text her when I leave from work that I’m coming home, don’t lock it. She locks it every time.

Last night when I got home it was inevitably locked. I couldn’t get it open and had a bad day. I cut my elbow trying to turn the key. When my wife got home I told her to stop locking the deadbolt or I would take it off the door. She got mad and said it’s a safety hazard to leave it unlocked. We live in a great town and it’s half an hour unlocked. 

I told her this and she said that I’m being unreasonable and waiting outside isn’t going to kill me. I told her she’s the unreasonable one and that maybe instead of being deathly afraid that someone is going to steal all $100 worth of carryable stuff in our house she should care that she keeps locking her husband out.

0,"WIBTA if I reported my friend for animal negligence? | Basically, around 2 years ago my friend moved out of home and bought two kittens. Due to health issues she ended up quitting her job and staying at home full time living on welfare (I am only mentioning this because I believe it is relevant to the problem). This meant she spent 24/7 in her 1 bedroom flat with her cats. As they grew out of the tiny kitten stage, she said she wanted more. So she bought 3. I was a little worried at first, I didn't know whether she had considered the commitment of having 5 cats but she seemed set on getting them. As she doesn't have work to focus on anymore, her cats have become her entire life.

Fast forward by about 9 months on and the same pattern just kept happening again and again, the cats started getting bigger and then she said she wanted more kittens. I suggested fostering kittens but she said it wouldn't be the same.  Now, she has 10 cats, all under 3 years old. Ultimately, they were being cared for so I stopped getting involved.

That is, until a month ago. I hadn't seen my friend in a while as I've started a teaching job. I thought it'd be a nice surprise to visit her but when I got to her flat, she didn't seem happy to see me at all. Her place was a tip. I know she suffers from depression so I tried to reassure her that there was no need to be embarrassed and helped her clean. As I reached for a box in the corner of the room she shouted at me not to touch it. I looked inside it and saw a bunch of newborn kittens curled up with one of her cats.

She explained she hadn't realised she had male cats and assumed they were all female. She'd never taken any of her cats to the vets, so none had been spayed or neutered or received any vaccinations because she ""didn't see the point in wasting money and putting them through invasive surgery"". While I was there I noticed 3 other cats with protruding stomachs, I asked if they're all pregnant and she said yes. When I asked whether she would consider taking them to be spayed (basically, aborting the kittens) she said absolutely not and that she'd be keeping any kittens she can't find homes for. I can't even do the math on how many cats that would leave her with.

So here's my dilemma. Talking to her is completely useless at this point. I offered to adopt a few of her cats but she refused. One of the pregnant cats is only 9 months old, and the others are not much older. Though all of the cats seem happy I just feel so bad for them. I'm meant to be her friend and I feel awful for considering this.

I would warn her first but I don't think it would achieve anything, I think if I told her she'd just freak out and threaten to harm herself, as she has done that kind of thing in the past. But I also think reporting her could mean all of the cats will be taken from her and I genuinely do not know if she'd mentally recover from that.

She was told that she could bring a plus one with her to the station to meet the band, and so she took me with her. Even in the car, she was so excited that she was shaking, and she kept saying that she wasn't sure she could do it. (I didn't care either way, I wanted it over with!)

She cried for most of it (awkward) and kept bowing to the members (she's white) and while I didn't say anything, I was SO embarrassed for her. Some of the guys also shook my hand and greeted me, but a few of them didn't, probably noticing that I wasn't really into it. Whatever, it wasn't for me it was for her, I'm not a fan.

She has some other friends who are also kpop fans, and when we all hung out later, she started talking about how wonderful and surreal it was to meet her ""idols"".

1,"AITA for trying to strongly dissuade my GF from doing a Ph.D? | Let me preface this that I quit my ph.D program out of choice. Why? I was a middle-of-the-pack student. For an average student like me, I stand little to no chance in landing a tenure-track position even at an ""average"" university. What awaited me was post-doc purgatory and adjunct teaching, where you make a \*pittance\* for the amount of education you have invested in yourself. Foreseeing this, I noped the fuck out and jumped to the job market.

&#x200B;

Enter my GF. She is a 28 years old Masters student in engineering. She has informed me on several occasions that she wants to pursue a Ph.D after graduating from her current program. I have been urging her to think twice about this momentous decision. Here are my arguments as to why I think a Ph.D is not good for her:

&#x200B;

1. The Ph.D department she wants to go to is not that highly-ranked. Landing a tenure-track position after graduating from there is a snowball chance in hell.

&#x200B;

2. You don't need a Ph.D in engineering to thrive in the professional/industrial job market.

&#x200B;

3. She has never been on the job market. How would she know she wouldn't like it?

&#x200B;

4. I don't think she knows what she's getting into. It's clear she hasn't thoroughly researched this career path. 

&#x200B;

5. She's not that young anymore. Do you really want to use your prime years for an endeavor with highly uncertain payoff? Even if you manage to get a job after, that's \~5 years of opportunity cost gone. That's \~5 years in which you could have been working because a Masters is perfectly \*sufficient\* already. 

&#x200B;

6. I don't think her personality is good for academia. She is a very quiet and somewhat passive. Teaching, competing for grants, going to conferences, and all that jazz would probably be tough for her. 

&#x200B;

7. Hell, if the Ph.D is really needed for her next promotion, what prevents her from going \*back\* to it after gaining some work experience on the job market first?

&#x200B;

Most importantly, though, it's that I see myself in her. I believe I was in her shoes 4 years ago. I do not want her to make the same mistake I did. 

&#x200B;

Now, here's where I could be the asshole:

&#x200B;

1. She's allowed to do whatever the fuck she wants. Maybe I can give her some (unsolicited?) advice, but it's not my purview to tell her what to do.

&#x200B;

2. The big one: I'm not that young anymore either. I'm also materialistic. Basically, I don't want a future in which my partner doesn't really contribute to the American Dream because she's still studying as an 30+ years old. If we are to share our life together, I'd want her to work. I'm scared of the uncertainty that her preferred career path brings.

&#x200B;

Because I legit care about her and \*because I want someone who can help me create the future I want\*, I've been trying to dissuade her from pursuing her goal.

Since we aren't a professional choir the concert was free to attend (we still asked for donations to break even for the rent of the town hall).

It was a very important event for me and my friends wanted to come too, partially to support me and some of them had family members in the choir so they also came to support their relatives.

As choir members we were allowed to reserve up to three seats for family and friends and I reserved three seats for three friends. My friends asked me to reserve seats with a good view of the stage.

People constantly walked up to the seats just to see the reserved sign and then walk away disappointed or upset. I especially felt bad for families with kids.

I told them they have 10 minutes to get here because people are constantly coming up to the seats to see if they're free and some people are even starting to not get any seats at all and they have to stand.

Five minutes before the concert started I removed the reserved sign and I let a small family take the seats.

My friends arrived a minute after the concert started and they were pissed that I gave away their seats. They told me that reserved means reserved and it shouldn't matter when they show up. They ended up having to stand for about two hours.

Life events like holidays or lunches/dinners with friends and family have been ruined because he doesn’t curb his drinking. I often have to drive him home and sit with him in the bathroom as he gets sick. He also has a tendency to wet the bed, or couch, or wherever he’s sleeping after a might of drinking. I’ve had to clean up countless messes and it’s to the point where I routinely buy adult diapers just to minimize the mess. 

He’s also very belligerent when he’s drunk and prefers to have all of our arguments after he’s been drinking. This makes for some really explosive disagreements and he often breaks up with me in a fit of drunkenness and then apologizes the next day or pretends it didn’t happen. 

Dealing with this for half a decade is just mentally and physically exhausting.

At one point she contacted my mother and brother without telling me to ask them about if I showed signs of it growing up. She wants me to get formally tested but upon looking into that's very difficult and expensive for an adult.

She joined a Facebook group for women with autistic boyfriends or husbands. The group seems to not act as a support group even if that's what it is in theory, but rather a place for women to vent about their autistic partners, or often just ex-partners of them venting about how awful they are. A lot of stuff she's shown me from it seems pretty bigoted, talking about how autistic people are basically sociopaths, how they can never understand emotions and never avoid from hurting people. She regularly shows me posts on it that ""remind her of me"" and sends me screenshots, often with her often hurtful comments about me intact. She asked on it if they thought I was on the spectrum and then showed me the responses. Her post was very one-sided in the description. The comments were very hurtful, most telling her to leave me, and about how I was obviously autistic and would never change. I told her how this hurts me and she just says that I need to address this even if it hurts because it could kill the relationship otherwise.

Whenever we discuss it we mostly go in circles. I pledge to change behaviors she dislikes and she shares stories from it as ""proof"" I might not be able to change and says it's important to talk about it because I need to be prepared if she decides to just walk away from the relationship as a result.

We once were having a discussion about boundaries. I asked if I could set some boundaries and one was not discussing that group with me. She got infuriated and went on a tirade against me, claiming my requests were ""rules, not boundaries"" and the only reason she shared that and other actions was ""a reaction to my bullshit"" so I had no right to complain about it, and how he she relies on that group for support because of my behavior so it's all ultimately my fault. She also regularly reminds me about how she might have to ""walk away from the relationship"" and how I shouldn't be bothered or offended if she does.

0,"AITA If I Choose A Random Couple For Adoption Than Stepsister? | 
So I (21F) am in my junior year of college. I’ve been extremely careful on not getting pregnant and have tried all avanues. My IUD moved and I almost died so I had to get it removed, the implant in my arm left a rash and started to burn so I had it removed, so me and my FWB started using the calendar and condom method which is basically when I’m not ovulating we would use the pull out method and when I was we would use a condom and a Plan B just for backup.

Well, I’m pregnant. I found out in the beginning of December that I am four weeks along. I knew immediately I didn’t want to keep the baby. I considered going through with an abortion via the pill. I got them but couldn’t do it. I know that it was selfish, but until you’re in those shoes you never know how it truly feels.

So I decided adoption. I told my friend that I was planning on delivering the baby and she told me about her brother and her sister in law back in her home state that have been struggling with infertility and have been desperately trying to conceive a baby for years without fail. We FaceTimed a few times and I think they would be perfect parents for my baby. They’re both well educated with well paying jobs and an amazing home they could raise a baby in. It actually made me excited to be able to know that the baby will go to a family that so desperately wants them. I decided they would be a great fit and since they’re so far away, it’s like it never happened kinda thing.

I finally brought it up to my mom yesterday that I’m pregnant and everything else. My moms first words were “What about Sylvia? Her and Jon would love a baby”. My older stepsister is 28 and infertile. She’s known this for years and we aren’t that close so I didn’t know if she ever planned on having a baby through other means.

I said no. Sylvia lives in the same city as me and I see her during holidays and any other family gatherings. I don’t want to adopt the baby into my own family circle and still have to be in some form of its life. I would basically become the step aunt? I just prefer the idea of having a closed adoption in a far away state with a picture every once in a while. My mom started gushing and called Sylvia immediately despite my protests who seemed really happy. She told my mom they were looking into an egg donor and a surrogate but this baby is so much less expensive and less of a hassle.

I told Sylvia that I don’t want to give the baby to her for the reasons I listed above and kind of already “promised” another couple that they could adopt the baby.

0,"WIBTA If I turned off my boyfriend's alarm clocks without telling him | Hello Everyone,

Its 5am and I don't have to be at work till 9am. I'm currently lying next to my snoring bf who doesn't even roll out of bed until I've already left for work (he has a job). So why am I awake right now? Is it insomnia? Restless leg syndrome? No.

ITS ALL OF THE GODDAMN ALARMS MY BF HAS SET TO GO OFF BETWEEN 5AM AND 8AM!

Here is a morning in my life.

5am:
 
bf's alarm goes off

He doesn't wake up

I wake up

I shake him awake 

He doesn't wake up 

I shake a little harder 

He doesn't wake up

I shake him a lot harder

He goes ""stooooooop""

He turns towards his cell phone

He just idk stares at it while the alarm is still going?

I shake him again

He turns off the alarm 

He goes back to sleep


Rinse and repeat for until 7am which is when I get out of bed. The alarms are still going off mind you I'm just not there to shake him awake. 

I've asked my bf several times to turn off all these alarms but he always has the same excuse. ""I need them to wake up I wake up slowly"" this statement is dumb for two reasons. 

1 - The alarm doesn't wake him up. I do. His alarm wakes me up and then I have to shake him awake multiple times within a few hours to get all these alarms turned off. Then he doesn't even become fully awake until I get out of bed and turn the light on

2 - Why does he even need an alarm at 5am when he doesn't even need to get ready until after 8am? The answer is he doesn't. The answer is that he set up alarms for one time events and then never turns them off!! Im being woken up for doctor's appointments for six months ago!

So like I said Ive asked my bf to turn off these alarms multiple times but he always has his excuses. I've been putting up with this for years, but I'm at the end of my mental rope. 

The alarms. They haunt me. The jingle. I hear it now. Even as Im looking at his phone which is clearly off I hear the jingle playing over and over in my head. I can't turn it off. I have to do something.

Three months after I broke up with my ex, he texts me randomly, asking for forgiveness (I’ve given him enough chances, so my good bye was final); when I didn’t respond to those texts, he responds by telling me he had pissed all over my couch and carpet just a month before our breakup, and then lied to me when I asked him why BOTH my couch cushions and even the upholstered base and frame under the cushions was wet, and why my couch has this weird stain. He simply insisted the couch and carpet were wet when he arrived and would not take my version of events. At that time, our relationship was already on shaky grounds and I had spent the better part of that day researching couples counselors and trying to convince him to go for couples counseling, so I really didn’t have the energy to pursue another battle about the couch. 

The fact that he knowingly let me sit on that couch for months after he did this is just mind boggling. I had even jokingly said to him the morning after the wet couch incident, “how did you spend the night watching TV on this couch, it’s so wet” (he watched TV till late). He just said he sat on a wet couch and it was a miserable night for him - the couch was too small, (it is actually larger than standard couches); the couch was wet; he can’t sleep in my house because he does not know where anything is (because I just moved two days ago and I did the whole move by myself 100%; he actually stayed at his house and played video games all day after promising to be around to see the movers did their job OK); he just did not like my house (he was a big complainer, so it was difficult to solve anything / reach a constructive solution with him). 

I am livid at this, but recognize that he is trying to engage me. Then he sends a text saying he will buy me a new couch. I am furious at his lies from that night / morning, but do not want to engage with him right away, so I stay silent. (He was / is someone with narcissistic tendencies and I really don’t want to engage with his word salad ever again). 

On the flip side, I have something that we both bought together and the plan when I broke up was that I’ll be selling it and splitting the funds between us; will come to about 300$ each. Ever since this I got these texts about him pissing on my couch, I do not care to return him anything. It will cost me as much to get a new couch and carpet- probably more given that my furniture is a couple of price points above Ikea.

We met on a dating app. The relationship has been amazing, the best relationship I’ve ever had and she’s a great girl. I did notice she had a few odd habits. Not super strange but some things I noticed: 

She’s obsessed with everything being clean and perfect hygiene, 
She insists on going to bed no later than midnight. If we’re out, she insists she has to get home before 11:30 even on the weekends.
She refuses to sleep with her phone in the room and charges it in the kitchen (even though she has roommates).  
She has this super bright “therapy lamp” by her desk that is supposed to simulate the sunlight and “makes her feel better”. 
 She is a super healthy eater who likes to eat at exact the same time every day 
 She takes like 8 different medications in the morning (she said most of them were supplements)

None of this really affected our relationship and I assumed she was just a really organized person. 

Last weekend we were out at this fancy club for one of her friend’s birthday. We were having a really fun time but then at 11:15 she said she had to go and get to bed. I was a bit disappointed since we were having fun but I offered to go with her. She said I could stay and she didn’t want to bother me since she was just going to sleep.  

After she leaves I start talking to Eve’s friend Lea and joke about how Eve sleeps so early. Lea laughs and then says she thinks she started doing it as part of her mental health recovery.  I had no idea what she was talking about and ask her what she’s talking about. Lea was surprised that I didn’t know and starts telling me about how Eve really struggled in the past with severe depression and basically dropped out of college and stopped talking to everybody for years. People thought she had disappeared. Around 2 years ago she started reconnecting with all her friends and telling them about her struggles with depression and how she was doing therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. She soon started school again and became really obsessive about doing everything perfectly but she’s doing so well now. Lea acted like it was no big deal but that it was weird I didn’t know since most people knew. 

I was shocked. The next day I “confront” Eve about why she never told me about her past with depression. She gets really defensive and just goes on about how Lea is an “obnoxious gossip who never shuts up”. I’m pretty angry at this point because she’s talking about her friend gossiping instead of her keeping a huge secret from me. She says I’m being an asshole and have no right to be mad and that she was “obviously going to tell me” and that she was just scared and waiting for the right moment.

He was absolutely heartbroken and didn't understand why he was the only one not invited.  I consoled him and calmed him down and he seemed to quickly forget about it and move on.

After 6 months I was upgraded from contractor to full-time employee and moved from the large team I started at to an intimate team of 6 people, working directly under my manager as the only non-remote employee in our dept.

Our team worked crazy hours, got little sleep, and were threatened with being disbanded for months. We became very close under those adverse circumstances. Eventually we got out of the danger zone and were able to bring more members to the team, which was nice. The dynamic remained close and we continued to put in long hours. One night I was there at 2am with my manager, and we were drinking since it was after hours in a very alcohol-friendly company, and she confessed that she really liked me. She asked me to break up with my girlfriend and date her instead, semi-jokingly. I laughed it off and said I couldn't do that, but felt disquieted. 

The next day I was wary since I had no idea she felt that way up until then, and started to question if maybe I'd been hired for my appearance and not my work (the person I was hired to replace was my boss's ex (I later found out), and VERY similar in looks to me). My manager asked if I was okay and I said yes but decided to be distant, which changed the vibe. She crossed the line imo when she scheduled a 1:1 during work hours to ask if ""we were cool"" and to talk about interpersonal things. After that I felt her watching me constantly, she'd leave work the same time to talk to me in the parking lot, and would try to corner me to check in on things when I was by myself... eventually I asked a male friend to warn me when she was around because I was so stressed. Our coworkers noticed and I didn't want to tell them about everything so I brushed their questions off, but it was obvious I was avoiding her. The exec of the 10 person team also pulled me aside and asked if I was being harassed but I said no... this situation was made more complicated by the fact that she was trans, and I identified as such as well at the time but did not present.

We will both have to agree on the cat that we get."" I then said, if it doesn't work out are you willing to take the cat back and not hold it against me?"" She said ""Yes.""

She's in started to buy cat stuff for the house. And I told her not to buy too much cat stuff because we weren't quite ready yet. She kept buying more, but I let it go because ultimately we didn't have the cat yet, and she was just getting prepared.

We were supposed to go look for a cat together. Admittedly I missed the first day because of my insomnia, I had to try to sleep some. This was not a new thing and after nine years. I thought she understood that. But she went to look with at cats without me. That part could be an easy misunderstanding. And I can accept that. It's what she did next that I could not accept.

She made the unilateral decision to fill out an application for adoption. She found a cat. She thought she liked and she did it without me? She came home from work and told me about a 10 month old cat she petted in a cage. She told me of how the store attendant wouldn't even let her take the cat out of the cage. And she told me that she filled out an application for adoption. I said ""No! I do not want this cat!.."" I said it was too young and the situation was too strange...

I said no for 3 days, and then she brought the cat home. I gave it a fair chance. Although my anxiety disorder was at level 11, I tried to work with the cat. And the cat was very loving. But he also attacked the TV when it was on. We tried misdirecting this Behavior to something else for 3 days. The second two of those days. He grabbed onto my hand and scratched me. Not maliciously, but still the exact thing I never wanted.

On day one. I told her it was a problem. On day two. I also told her it was still a problem. And the same goes for day 3. On day 4 she agreed to return the cat, But now she pretty much hates me. She wanted a cat so very much that she threw everything about her and I out the window. On paper. I am definitely right, but emotionally I still feel wrong.

0,"AITA for not changing seats on a red eye flight for a Mum with three kids | I apologise in advance for any spelling or grammar mistakes.

So last night I was flying from LAX to Lima. This was my 2nd flight out of the three I had to take and I had been up since 5am as I had to catch a pretty early bus to get to the airport on time.

On top of getting up early the last couple of days I’ve been working overtime most days into early hours of the morning and not getting a whole lot of sleep due to conflicting work schedules with my room mates so I was running on very little sleep.

After finding my seat on the plane I see a family of 5 get on the plane (Mum, Dad and three boys under the age of 10 ) and pray that they won’t be sitting near me but they were.

I had specifically booked a window seat so I could rest against the window and sleep and for some reason the parents had booked the two aisle seats and the complete middle row so the kids could sit in middle and they would sit either side, but the rows weren’t lined up exactly so the mum and dad were slightly in front of the children and had to look back. 

I could hear the parents arguing and and knew it was coming the Mum turns to me and ask me if I’d mind moving to one of the aisle seats so it would be easier for them to sit together with one parent in the aisle and one kid next to the parents in my seat.

I said I’d rather not because I was really tired and had specifically booked a window seat the mother explained and tried to ask again and I said if there were no other options I’d move they asked some other people to move but nobody else wanted move either.

She didn’t end up asking me again but she seemed pretty stressed out during the flight and    Ended up having to get up a lot

0,"AITA for refusing to hold hands with a stranger on an airplane? | Hello Reddit!

I recently flew in a plane by myself. at first I thought maybe I had lucked out big time getting a empty row. But sure enough, a girl straggled on the plane last minute and sat next to me (the seats are not assigned)

I joked “I knew it was too good to be true!” and chuckled to try to lighten the mood but no reaction. I looked behind at the guy behind me laughing and said “right?” but he had earphones in. 

As the plane began to disembark the girl was clearly experiencing a lot of anxiety. She was going “ohhhhh” rubbing her knees. I was trying not to get nervous myself, but seeing her freak out was not helping. I just tried to ignore it.

But she kept up, getting louder as the plane taxi’ed. I could tell everyone else was getting annoyed by her as well. she apologized to me and said it’s her first time flying alone.

The plane started accelerating down the runway and when it took off, her screaming had reached mach 5. With every tremor she went “OH !!!! MY GOD! OH MY GOD” etc. 

People were staring a bit. I said, “It’s okay. I get nervous too” and told her she was more likely to have gotten in an accident on the way to the airport and since she hadn’t yet, she was doing pretty good so far. 

She said you’re right. thank you. And calmed down briefly before the plane wringled and she was back to screaming.

this is where it got strange. She said straight up “I know this is weird but could you hold my hand? it would really help” I was pretty taken aback. for reasons it is unnecessary to describe I don’t like to be touched unless I am very close with the person. 

I said “wow, take me out to dinner first!” trying to make a joke with the hopes it would deflect the offer without outright turning her down. but she persisted. A particularly forceful bump occured and she yelped and instinctively grabbed my hand. 

It was very sudden so I also yelped and instinctively jerked it back. I said “I’m sorry, no offense, I just don’t like to be touched unless I care about the person” etc 

I could tell the lady in the row across from us also thought the girl’s behavior was strange because she shot the nastiest look at her past me. 

I was very sympathetic to her. but also I felt I had a right to enforce a boundary.

after more turbulence i could see her hand getting close to mine. At this point I was beginning to have a panic attack myself so I went to the restroom. I was honestly just uncomfortable so I saw a vacant row as I walked back and took an empty seat. 

After the plane ride my mom and sister picked me up and I told them about the incident. my mom agreed with me. my sister on the other hand just likes to stir the pot so of course she said that I was a dick.

She was underweight t some point but not really now. I guess lately she's been ok because my parents don't really talk about it and I know she doesn't see a nutritionist anymore but just a therapist a couple times a month. I still kinda worry though but I didn't see much of my sister when she was at her worst (I recently moved back home after being away) so IDK if I'm wrong here.

Basically today she was making lunch and I came upstairs in the kitchen. Our parents were not home.  'If you want the kitchen, I'll be out in a couple minutes.' I said okay and just stood there watching her make her food. She didn't notice at first but when she did she said 'Uh could you not?' I said 'I just want to make sure you're okay, eating and everything."" She looked at me really weird and said 'I'm fine, it's none of your business and you're making me uncomfortable.' I said that wasn't my intention I just was checking on her. I really didn't mean anything except making sure she's eating. She said I was the last person she'd confide into about her problems anyways. Ouch. We don't have a great relationship but I want her to like eat and be okay and stuff.

She finished making food and stomped off. Later my mom told me my sister had talked to her and my mom explained to me my sister was actually doing good but I was making her feel like a child 'making sure she eats' and my parents trust her to eat, and it's been a while since things have been really bad.

We put her to sleep and I was in the bathroom (next to her bedroom). I come out 10mins later and immediately smell smoke. The air is thick with it. 
I yell hey do you smell smoke? 
My wife is in the kitchen doing some homework with her headphones in. She gets up right away Bc her phone goes off. 

I yell with more urgency “HELLO DO YOU SEE SMOKE.” She immediately gets defensive and says “I had my headphones in and I didn’t hear you. My phone just rang so I went to get it”

She has this pattern of behavior with her where she has zero accountability for anything but that’s really not the point here. I only bring it up Bc it has gotten to a point where literally nothing is her fault. We argue and whenever I ask please tell me the last time something was your fault and she usually goes off saying something like I’m done w this or I lm not repeating myself or etc to deflect. 

Anyway, again I repeat “I’m saying do you see smoke in her room?!? CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK” Now to be upfront, I am panicking a bit here and definitely was yelling. It was not civil or nice the way I said it. 

I have issues w my contacts and sometimes things look foggy so I needed confirmation. I smelled smoke and saw it but also having my wife there to confirm would have made a huge difference if we were gonna move our daughter out of the room (and give up the precious sleep we expected). 

She tells me to stop yelling at her and that it wasn’t her fault for not hearing me. Now I’m incredibly agitated and yell at her “I don’t care about what your talking about like at all. Please just go check to see if there’s smoke” again, full disclosure, I yelled this at her. 
There’s smoke near my daughters room And I’m asking for help. 

She looks at me and says well what do you want me to do about it. Puts her earphones back in and continues her homework. 

I’m pretty shocked at the lack of care. It turned out to be nothing - smoke from a neighbor burning the dinner but her room was filled with obvious haze that anyone could see. I took her out and let her sleep in our bed. Wife meantime hasn’t gotten up once from her spot. 

I considered if the smoke was from her( maybe she burned something) but there was no smell or smoke in the kitchen just all in or daughters room. 

I am furious w her right now and seriously contemplating leaving her.

&#x200B;

My mom kicked me out of the house that year, and I had nowhere else to go. Dylan and I decide to get that apartment we've been planning for awhile, but we need a third roommate. Hayley volunteers, we're all set, they can have their cats since it's off-campus, I'm not homeless anymore. I figured out Hayley is a cool friend, but a sucky roommate. The more notable events/points:

&#x200B;

\- Complained she didn't like certain chores (she gagged while doing them). NBD, we all just switch chores. Wouldn't do the ones she picked. Rolls her eyes and sighs when asked. I'm on bedrest with severe illness, and The mess gets so bad even Dylan can't pick up the slack.

&#x200B;

\- If her family (well-to-do, lil bit judge-y) come over, everything has to be super clean, right then. Maybe I should've left the mess to see what happened.

&#x200B;

\- Brought kittens into the house from her crush. Barn cats, had fleas. Months-long, costly infestation that thank God didn't spread to the neighbors. She blamed our bathed, treated, collared cat and not help us until locking the cats out of her bedroom won't save her from the fleas.

&#x200B;

Things got worse when she found a boyfriend in one of my and Dylan's friends and spent all her time with his. I asked her to drop me off at the ER (not even stay, just drop me at the door, I explained this), and she pulled a face, saying she would, but she didn't know how to tell her boyfriend she'd be late to come stay with him for the weekend. I told her it was fine, ended up having to call Dylan at work to come take me. I was pretty upset about it, actually, but that could have been the pain I was in. Kidney stones fucking suck.

&#x200B;

She's gotten a lot worse about the chores since then, and I can't talk to her about them without her boyfriend puffing up and trying to interfere, since she's his gf now and can do no wrong (I'm serious, he's not the chum I knew before this). She started to spend more time at his house, only coming by for the key (she lost hers) to go into the apartment to drink, and I suppose do couple things. Then she stopped coming by altogether.

To preface, her husband's family comes from a very rural, backwoods part of a southern state, whereas my family is more of a northeastern city area near NYC. So there is a bit of a culture clash that I am taking into account.

My girlfriend is my sister's best friend and she had to give a speech. She is VERY nervous speaking in front of crowds but she wanted to give a speech for my sister. 

She starts the speech and is visibly nervous as her voice shakes a little. My side of the family is quiet but a couple of people from the groom's family shout out ""no need to be nervous, we're all friends here!"" I wanted no one to interrupt but that wasn't a big deal.

What started to annoy me was that as the speech went on, and she told a joke, the rural side would erupt with laughter as if it was the funniest thing in the world (even though it was only worthy of a chuckle and she knew that). The bride and groom seemed to be enjoying the speech and didn't mind the people constantly heckling but I was getting pissed off.

I eventually called out to them ""will you slack jawed bumpkins shut the fuck up and let her finish?"" and they all stayed quiet.

0,"AITA for expecting my husband to help in the middle of the night without arguing. | My husband and I have a 2.5 month old, and as you can imagine our baby comes with his share of needs to be met including in the middle of the night.

Early on my husband and I developed a system where I would nurse him from one breast, then my husband would change his diaper then I'd nurse him from the other breast before putting him back to sleep. This helped because it meant that after falling asleep on the first breast my husband could wake him up a little to get him to eat more from the second which meant more sleeping between feedings. Also if I changed his diaper if have to set him down and wash my hands before starting the other side and he'd already be asleep which didn't work as well.

My husband would fuss and complain every time I woke him up to do a diaper change, but after the first few weeks (when we didn't really sleep at all anyway) it was really only 2-3 times a night so it wasn't terrible.

Then 2 weeks ago, it was discovered that I had a raging infection in my left breast. I didn't get a fever or anything like most do, so by the time it was discovered it was huge and required surgery to drain and clean out.

Unfortunately now I'm nursing from only one side and desperately trying to build my supply up on that side to try and support a rapidly growing baby. This means he's hungry every 1.5-2 hours day and night.

Now every time I wake my husband up to do a diaper change he complains and argues and asks for more time then after getting a bit more time he complains and argues again how he shouldn't have to change the diapers. In the mean time I have to pump and store any milk I might pump then clean them pump parts before I can go back to sleep.

All this arguing plus the extra steps of getting up 5-6 times a night means that while my husband snores away between feedings I lay awake in bed being pissed off at him.

We talk about it every morning, and he apologizes and says he'll try to be better but he's just so tired, and he can't help what he says and does when he's first woken up and how he'll try to be better but probably just can't change.

We tried to set up a deal last night where I would give him a 3 minute warning (can you tell I work with kids?) And after his 3 minutes he would get up and take care of the baby without asking for more time or arguing. Right now it's 3am all 3 times he's asked for more time, then argued about how I should just change the diaper myself then finally told me ""I'm working on getting up"" while falling back asleep 2 more times.

The book was terrible. It reads like amateur fanfiction with blatantly copy+pasted elements from other books and TV shows in the same genre (fantasy). My friend is not a native English speaker and that's an obvious fact when you read their book, the prose of the novel jarring and awkward to read. The actual plot and characters are amateurish even in comparison to published books that I find to be terrible (like Twilight for example).

My friend is very, very proud of the book and wants to get it properly published. They're extremely enthusiastic that everyone should read it (but in a good willed, non pushy way) and gets very excited when someone does. Everyone who's read the book agrees that it's badly written but lies when they tell my friend about it since it's clear it would hurt them if they told the truth. Like with most self-published works, they're relying on their friends and family to buy it, so feedback is lot more personal. I didn't say anything after I read it because I didn't want to lie to them. They've already sunk a lot of money into getting it self-published in the first place.

They also seem quite naive about how the publishing industry works and are taking some pretty big missteps in that regard. It's like they're just following the ""how not to get published"" rules.

I'm also a writer and semi-professional at it with a high degree in the field. Harsh \*but constructive\* criticism is part of the game.

Our dad was a sperm donor and it has always been a touchy topic in our family. He donated solely because there was (is?) a shortage of donors in our country and he fathered 7 kids to 5 families which is the maximum number of families permitted by law.

Our dad had a relationship with two of his ""donor kids"" that had reached out as adults. One of them has reached out and obviously offered their support, but cannot attend the service. The other had become very close to our father to the point where our dad literally referred to her as his daughter etc. She didn't have a dad of her own (lesbian parents) and so bonded quite quickly when she reached out.

Anyway, cutting to the chase, his donor daughter wants to attend his funeral service and is just as broken up as we are. My sisters are all against the idea and think it would be ""creepy"", ""weird"", etc. They all expect me to tell her no because she isn't ""real family"".

But I'd feel like absolute shit saying no. She literally said she wont say a word to anyone and will just attend the service in silence. She just wants to honor dad, I don't get why my sisters are so vehemently opposed to her presence. Our dad left her some money from his estate so he obviously considered her family.

Anyway, since my sisters left it on me to plan, I told her to come and intend on making her feel welcome. I don't think a funeral is a time to exclude and alienate someone that is hurting.

As you can imagine I am now being called countless names by my sisters and also my mother. I think I might have accidently been an asshole here? Idk. AITA?",False,False,5,4,3,2,3,3,Care
0,"AITA for refusing to let go of my grudge against my stepfather? | Throwaway account. 

I [23M] have something of a hefty backstory. My bio father left my mum while she was pregnant and idek who he is. She remarried when I was 3 to my stepfather and had my first sister a year later. Stepfather had always been cold towards me, but when his own kid was born, he basically decided he didn't want to raise someone else's child too and I got put into care. I was in and out of the care system (mostly in it) until I was 15, when I was graciously allowed back into my family home because I was grown up enough now that he wouldn't have to deal with me. 

Now, my time in care was awful. I'm sure you've all heard the horror stories about what hapems to kids in the system sometimes, and that I don't need to go into too much detail. Any time I saw my mum I would beg her to come home but he just simply wouldn't allow it. I grew a really intense feeling of resentment towards my stepfather, and I still have it because honestly, fuck him for making me go through that. 

Now the man is sick. It could be terminal, but he's receiving treatment so potentially not. Mum wants me to make ammends with him, just in case, but I've no interest in that. I've told her as much, and told her why. She keeps telling me to ""see his side"", like that makes it any better. He shoved me into the system because he's too proud to raise another man's child? What kind of a justification is that? Mum keeps talking about how difficult it was for him to have a child with a disability, which he does as my second sister has Down's syndrome, but that's also a bs justification because: 1. I'd already been in the system for *four years* when she was born and 2. Her intellectual disability/developmental delay is really mild and she's honestly more or less on the same level as other kids her age and always has been, so it isn't like she has really difficult to cater to special needs. He's tried using the ""problem child"" excuse, and while it's true I acted out as a teenager, I believe that was a result of being in the system, not vice versa. 

TL;DR: my stepdad put me in care when my sister was born bc he didn't want to raise another man's kid now he had his own. Now he's sick and wants forgiveness but I still hold him responsible for the hellish experience I had in the system.",False,False,5,4,3,2,1,4,Care

I’m 30 years old and have some pretty serious health conditions. 
Until April I was going to my grandparents house every day from 9am until 7pm to care for them both. In April we moved in with my in laws whilst we waited to find a new home, as they lived further away and I don’t drive I then went 3-4 times a week for at least 3 hours at a time. I’ve been caring for them for years now. 

In June my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer and on Thursday we were told it was time for him to go into the hospice, however they had no space.
I went on Thursday until 9pm when I had to leave to sort my dogs out, I then went back Friday afternoon and have been there ever since. Helping care for grandad, cleaning the house ect. 
My grandad passed away on Sunday afternoon and my grandmas back pain was suddenly worse so she’s now bed ridden and can’t sit up at all. 

My uncle has gone on holiday he left the morning after my grandad passed and my father won’t do any actual care for grandma (cleaning her up, helping her use the bedpan as she can’t get up to the toilet). 

Since Sunday I’ve done everything alone, grandma has you up stairs every 5 minutes, she won’t let you stay upstairs but then demands you back to feed her, give her drinks, help her use the bedpan, keep her company, change the sheets ect. I’ve also been doing all the housework and I’m exhausted. 

My uncles wife has arrived and taken over but she lives 5 hours away and can’t stay indefinitely because she has children. 

We are currently waiting for the X-ray to verify but the doctor said he thinks it’s a crushed vertebrae and it’s likely to be months before she can sit up.

I come from a family of nine nieces and nephews. One has special needs so I thought I could handle anything. The little girl kicked her brother, spit, refused to put pajamas on. The little boy was an angel and cooperative for dinner, playing, bed time. I told the older one it was time to go to bed and she went wild like a banshee. She would climb on the kitchen table. I would lift her off the table and bring her back to bed. Several times. She would hide under the table. I put her back in bed several times, for her to get out.

On the day we found out we (my mom, wife and I) hung around my grandma's house doing crosswords together to pass the time until everyone got together for dinner, my wife slept instead of sitting with my mom and I.

She would simply get up, pack her bags and waltz straight out the door saying she had period pains. The teachers normally did not stop her but if they did she would glare at them until they let her go.

So, me being a young man, decided to complain to my friends, a group of girls, about how she was faking it and skipping school. They didn’t have none of my shit and proceeded to criticize me about not understanding how a girls body works, how period pains were the worst feeling in the world and how insensitive I was.

All I wanted was to make a light joke and voice my annoyance about how my classmate could simply skip school by saying she had period pains but I guess nobody else thought it was as funny as i did.",False,False,3,2,1,1,1,2,Care
0,"AITA for refusing to celebrate Christmas? | Hey guys.

My name is Jason (50M) (wow when did I get that old?)  and I live with my wonderful girlfriend Jessie (47F). She has three grown children all attending college. Before I met Jessie I was married. We were high school sweethearts and had two beautiful boys together. On Christmas Eve twenty years ago they were sadly in a fatal car accident and in one day I lost everything.

In all honesty I haven’t celebrated Christmas since. I’ve come a long way, but celebrating Christmas makes me sick to my stomach. Just thinking about my boys, thinking about the day I lost them and how they’ll never experience another Christmas makes me want to... I just don’t want to go there.

My girlfriend is an incredible support for me. She’s helped me with so much, and in a way I think she has brought me back to life. Her patience, her caring, her love. I could live a millions lifetimes and I still wouldn’t deserve it. She is a Christmas nut, but all ten years we’ve been together she’s let me do my thing. Disappear just before Christmas and return once it’s over. However this year she’s been pushing me to stay at home. Telling me how much the kids would appreciate me being there. How we need to spend it as a family. That I need to move on.

I realize that it has been 20 years, and I think she might be correct in what she’s saying. So I’m asking you, strangers of Reddit, Am I the asshole for not celebrating Christmas with my family?",False,False,5,1,3,1,1,3,Care
1,"AITA My wife wants to tell the kids, I'd rather they keep happy memories |  

My wife found out about my affair two days ago.  I’ve been trying to explain to her that I’ve been feeling like there’s no intimacy between us for a long time. This isn’t something that just happened, we’ve been in a downward spiral for the last six years. Up until last October we barely saw eachother. She would go on walks before leaving for work and I wouldn’t see her until later that night when I climbed into bed next to her sound asleep. We’ve been living like roommates and staying together for the sake of our kids, who are six and eleven. I don’t know if she’s cheated on me, but I suspect so, and really I don’t care, our relationship isn’t about us anymore and it hasn’t been for a long time.

I say until last October because she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I’ve been by her side giving her the emotional support she needs and taking care of her when she’s helpless due to chemo. If she’d gone to screenings like I’ve suggested to her over the years they could have caught it early enough that treatment would’ve been more effective. But at this time we’re planning our last Christmas together. 

I know it was wrong of me to cheat, and that probably makes me an asshole. But she wants to tell our kids that mom and dad need space from eachother and that she wants to move in with her mom. I think it's better if we act like nothing happened for the sake of our kids so that they have the memory of a happy family for the last year with their mother.  And if we live separately the kids will eventual find out why we split and they might hate me for it, causing lasting damage to our relationships. Of course, if she somehow makes a recovery, I'm more than open to the idea of a divorce.

Sister works full time and spends almost all of her money on childcare because Mum and Brother made it clear that she was on her own in terms of looking after Nephew, and she's done a good job of arranging it so whenever Nephew isn't in school, either she is with him or a babysitter is, unless there's an unforeseen emergency where things can get a bit rocky.

Today was an emergency situation. Sister had a crisis at work and everyone was expected to stay at least 2 hours late. She tried to get out of it but had no luck. She called the sitter, who was busy. She then called me. I was out of work in time to get Nephew and could drive him home but I had stuff to do at home and because I'm so far away if I brought Nephew to my place then someone would need to drive nearly 2 hours to get him home again.

Sister then called Brother. Brother does not have a license. He said he couldn't drive so he couldn't do pick up (even though the school is within a 20 minute walk of the house and 5 minutes on the bus) but said, in what Sister admitted was a very obviously sarcastic tone, if Nephew could make his own way home then sure, Brother would watch him, and then he hung up. Sister hadn't told Brother at that point that that I could drive Nephew home, it was the watching I couldn't do. Sister said she should be home within a couple hours but I could hear her getting a telling off for being on her phone and knew she had to go, so I said to leave it with me.

I decided to call Brother's bluff. I picked Nephew up, drove him home, and when Brother opened the door I handed Nephew over and said it was very nice of him to help Sister out. I could see him protesting but I was already walking back to my car. I stayed long enough to see Brother take Nephew inside and close the door. I texted Sister that Nephew was home safe. On the drive home Brother called multiple times, which I didn't answer because driving, but on getting home there were dozens of texts and voicemails calling me a bitch for leaving Nephew with him, saying he was obviously being sarcastic and I shouldn't have put him in this position.

I try to stay calm and tell her to calm down, but I admit, sometimes I lose my cool and I yell back at her and we have a screaming match. We certainly don't always fight, and there are days where she's outright pleasant, but she's a teenager, so outbursts are bound to happen.

Some new neighbors moved in below us last month, and they have already called the cops on us, as well as reported us to the management. When the cops came, my daughter had already calmed down, so the cops didn't hear anything.

Honestly no friends that I made here are homophobic, but I happened to have a bad experience with my first roommate because of his beliefs.

That wasn't very pleasant and since I'm usually more panicky person, I started feeling anxious about coming out to my new roommate. Despite the fact that there were no signs that he's homophobic, he even has LGBT friends, but I just didn't want to potentially go through that first experience again.

This week my boyfriend came over from Poland to visit. He stayed in a youth hostel because even though you can technically get away with someone staying at your dorm room for longer time, you both have to be sneaky and we just didn't really want that stress. The hostel is cheap and I helped him pay for it.

My roommate didn't know about this for the mentioned reasons. We're kinda close though and he's in class with one of my friends this semester.

This is very expensive but I'm happy paying it and is gives me everything I want.

1,"AITA for insulting my cheating ex over the fact her father left her as a child? | Hi, this is a throwaway as I don’t want this linked to my main account. Apologies for mobile formatting yada yada.

So I’ll get right into it. I (19m) go to a top university in the UK. I am a second year and live with my ex girlfriend (19f) and 3 of our mutual friends. This came about because in my first year, I started dating my now ex near the start of Uni and we all decided to live together for second year. Near the end of the year she cheated on me by sleeping with some random bloke she’d pulled in a club. I confronted her and broke it off. 

Fast forward to September and the arrangement is now very awkward as we’re not on speaking terms, yet share a house. There is a lot of tension and mutual dislike in the air. She has done a lot of petty things so far this year which I won’t get into, but safe to say she’s pissed off everyone in the house and there are arguments almost daily. 

Well a couple of nights ago I was coming back from a night out with my friends at around 2 or 3am, and it’s possibly important here to note that she doesn’t have any friends at university, whereas I am involved in several societies, was always the ‘popular’ social butterfly of our house, go out multiple times a week etc and that this was always a point of contention during our relationship as, though she didn’t like to admit it, she was always jealous. 

I went into the kitchen to fill up a bottle of water. I’m quite drunk at this point. Well lo and behold she is in there and turns to me to say something along the lines of ‘drunk again?’ With a smirk and belittled me for enjoying myself. I said it’s not my fault she’s a loner and that nobody likes her, we argued a bit about cleaning and other household issues. She then says that at least Adam liked her and that’s why she cheated because he was better than me, which really pissed me off.

I mention how lonely it must be to have no friends and family being so far away and ask if she heard me the other night with a girl I’d brought home. She said she’s glad she hurt me and asked if I’ve mentally recovered. She knew I had on and off mental health issues while we dated. Which was the final straw as I had further mental health issues for most of that summer as a direct result of her. I said to her, shouting, ‘at least my daddy didn’t fucking leave me when I was 5, if he could see you now he’d leave all over again you dirty little cunt.’

She burst out crying and ran from the kitchen. She had her mum pick her up the next day, and I haven’t seen her since. My housemates, who already dislike her are on my side. My friends and family are also on my side for the most part. 
I knew her insecurities from our time together and said the most hurtful thing I could muster, specifically targeting what I knew would cause the most pain and distress and probably took it too far, so while I hate her, I’m aware I’m probably in the wrong, though remorse still eludes me.

The agreement between my roommate and I was that she didn't have to pay rent, as long as we could split the electric and utilities bill. Also, I'm in a wheelchair. If I needed something during the night, like a drink of water, or if there were ever a fire or I got violently ill, it was understood that she'd help me out. So long as she followed our agreement, she could live rent-free in a $2700/month apartment in a desirable area that she'd been looking to move to. She stayed with me while she got her feet on the ground, then her ex moved back town and they got back together, and she moved in with him. (I have mixed feelings about the timing of it all, but I digress.)

Around the same time, my mom's younger brother (53M) had to temporarily leave his home because the well that provided his water supply had dried up. Without a second thought, I offered up the spare bedroom. My uncle has spent the last several years being down on his luck; he can't seem to hold on to a job for more than six months, and his living situation has changed several times throughout the last five years, whether that's because he's been evicted or because he just abandons the place he lives.

He moved into my apartment with the same understanding. I even covered the cost of utilities and electric until he got a job. The only thing I asked was if I needed help in the middle of the night, could he please help me. Of course he agreed. He's known me all my life and knows that I need help with certain things.

However, there's a very ugly side to his personality and it came out very quickly. I've struggled with depression for all of my adult life. He's made comments that depression isn't real, and that I'm smart enough to just get over it on my own without counseling or my antidepressants. He makes snide comments about my brother, who I love more than anyone in the world. He says that if it weren't for me, my brother and I wouldn't have a relationship because my brother doesn't put any effort into our relationship.

She does great, and i rarely need to help her along the pathways or off the curbs when we are out and about. However, often we will walk through public parks and she is scared of dogs... but is completely fine if they are on a lead and the owners are present to restrain them.

On this Saturday we were lined up outside of a very popular ice cream shop. It was extremely busy and has an outdoor service window so people can order outside instead of going in. We were lined up with a bunch of people who had dogs and Lacy was fine. However, a few minutes later someone lined up behind us, the girl that ended up behind us had a very aggressive terrier. I am not at all bothered by dogs, well behaved or not... but I could tell Lacy was getting anxious and her hands were getting sweaty. For some reason the dog was taking a special interest in the wheelchair, and not a pleasant one. He kept barking incessantly at Lacy and grabbed a hold of my jeans with his teeth when i stepped between him and Lacy as a barrier. He was gnawing away at the wheels and i would gently brush him off. Lacy was actively trying to move away from the dog, but as she moved up, the girl behind us moved up too, while still paying absolutely zero attention to the dogs behaviour and chatting to her friend.

Eventually I tried to get the girls attention, as she was deep in conversation and clearly used to tuning out the barking and growling. Instead of looking at me when i said ""excuse me..."", she just held up a finger, as if to say ""one second"", and then proceeded to keep on talking. It was such a rude gesture that my ears actually burned with fury. I pushed Lacy up a bit further and then the guys in front of us asked us ""is that dog bothering her?"" and just as i was about to answer the terrier jumped up and nipped at Lacys fingers and she screamed. Reflexively I swung around and grabbed the dog by its abdomen as it was just about to jump and pushed it away, probably a little more aggressively than i should have  (it fell over).... while nearly spluttering

I feel terrible for saying that but it really was. A lot of my family members and some of hers were glancing around like WTF? Go home and do that in private. 

After a while it became apparent that it was making everybody uncomfortable and even my MIL reccommend that she rest at home before it gets too late. She refused and said she was fine. In the middle of the kids opening their presents she went into pain again and this time she even screamed for a second. I then discreetly pulled her husband to the side and told them to leave. I did it politely (""Hey I appreciate you guys for being here but I think its time to go. I dont want you guys to give birth in our kitchen! lol"").

After I said that her husband got angry and quickly got her and the kids packed up. She  visibly upset and before heading out called me a bitch and said that I ruined Christmas for her. A few of their sides family members gave me dirty looks and left soon after.

1,"WIBTA for moving 15 hours away from my children? | I have 3 children with my ex 6,5,3

I'm expecting a child with my partner in 7 months.

I live literally 1 minute away from my ex and children, I see them all the time, I have them every other week, walk them to school and we have family meals every Friday.

Recently I got offered a better job, it pays almost double what I earn currently.

If I want this job I would have to move 15 hours away meaning seeing the children will be a tad more complicated than just popping up the street .

The issue is I've told my ex, I'd be willing to drive 15hours there to pick the children up for half terms, I can go there friday and stay for Saturday too.

She thinks I'd be an asshole since I make a comfortable living right now.

I do not need the money at all, I just want to have savings there for the children.

She claims moving away from the children without need would be an asshole move especially with a  baby on the way it will look like I'm moving away to be away from them with my new family.

They won't understand why they went from seeing me every day to only seeing them on holidays and Saturdays.

This job is literally a dream for me.

0,"WIBTA if I break up with my boyfriend over his weed usage? | First time poster with a throwaway for obvious reasons.

My boyfriend (early 20s) and I (same age, F) have been dating for 3 years. He was actually the one who introduced me to weed when I asked him to a little before our relationship began. He had a history of heavy smoking; my parent are very anti-drug so I was very new to it. I love him very much, and we don’t really have any issues apart from this one.

Anyway, for me, weed was pleasant but it was just a phase. For about a year now, I don’t have any desire to smoke. Especially after I’ve seen what it’s done for my boyfriend. 
When he smokes, he has little motivation, he has dropped out of school many times. He will say because of money, but he continues to spend money on weed? It’s been an issue for a while now. I try not to be judge-y. I really tried to be okay with it but something inside just rejects it. I just want him to be his best self, and get ahead because smoking has been part of what’s put him behind. 

I’m thinking of telling him that it’s me or weed. I hate to sound controlling. I don’t want to say he can never smoke again, just that he needs to stop buying it in quantities that feed the habit.

Now as a baby Charlotte had a traumatic brain injury at around 8 months old when her brother accidentally pulled a book case down on her, it partially caved in her skull which left her in a coma for 2 months, but she recovered well.

it's important to mention these 2 things because despite a rough start with the injury and she has had no trouble or seizures since. 

She gets migraine headaches but that may be unrelated.

so, this morning, we decided to go to the local mall for some bits and pieces, we split up and went to seperate shops.

half an hour later Charlotte calls my cell crying asking where i am.
I told her to calm down and tell me where she is, she said she was really confused and described what shops were nearby, i went to meet her and she was still crying.

She said she was in the middle of the shop when suddenly she didnt know where she was.
it's hard to describe it like she did because it was gibberish. She said its like she suddenly woke up in the store and had no idea how she got there and had no idea how long she had been there. from one second shopping and then suddenly finding herself standing in the store, i asked her what the last thing she remembered was but she said she wasn't sure because everything felt surreal. She said it was the strangest feeling but what bothered her most was that she felt like she had been in the store for hours despite suddenly finding herself there? are you seeing the holes in her logic yet?

Charlotte asked me to take her home because her vision went blurry like it dose before she gets a migraine, we drove home and ill admit i was a little pissed off because this is the first day off I've had in ages and i didn't get chance to get anything.

When we were home Charlotte took her migraine medicine and called her doctor and got an appointment for tomorrow morning but was advised to go to the hospital if her migriane got worse. Anyway it eased up with the codiene and she went to sleep. When she woke up she said she thinks it may have been a type of seazure, now im not a doctor obviously but i know what a seazure looks like and this sounds nothing like a seazure, she didn't faint or spasm or injure herself.

she literally just spaced out in the store and had what sounds like a major panic attack that we had to drop our shopping and dinner plans for.

i wasn't expecting her to blow up about it, but she said i was being a complete jerk. she isn't the attention grabbing type but i think it might have been like a pre migriane panic attack but she completely denies this saying she literally seemed to wake up in the store.

she has gone to lay back down because she feels sick after migraines and i do feek like a jerk but i don't think it was a seazure at all AITA",False,False,4,2,3,2,1,3,Care

A few days after arriving she was coughing and had a runny nose. My wife is 39 weeks and has been in and out of the delivery ward 3 times with contractions. I finally confronted her about it and requested a few things: 1) she drives a separate vehicle to the hospital, 2) she wears a mask around us, 3) we don't eat together, 4) she stays in the waiting room. When I told her these things my wife just broke into tears. Her mother means everything to her. I kept saying I'm sorry. And they kept saying ""its ok. it's the right thing to do.""  
Its been a challenging pregnancy and I have no idea what the baby's immune system is going to be like directly out of the womb. I also don't want me or my wife getting sick because that will undoubtedly lead to the baby getting sick.  
Mother-in-law took things so seriously that she wont leave her room. And she won't say a word to me. But I still hear her coughing. My wife says she agrees with me, but I know would be hugging and kissing her mom if I didn't put my foot down.  
I called two doctors about the situation. One said that baby's get exposed to everything so mother-in-law can be in the delivery room but make sure everyone washes their hands. Another suggested that its ok if she's there with a face mask. I trust the doctors and am now happy to move my position inline with the doctor - ""she can be in the delivery room but with a mask"".

She has a bit of a drinking problem, extreme social anxiety, and is controlling of him, but he’s tolerant of all these issues, and feels as though he needs to be there for her as help her through all of it. 

However our entire friendship she’s insisted we can’t be friends, can’t hang out, or spend time together because she is uncomfortable with it even though nothing has ever happened between us previously. I did try to befriend her and offered to meet her so she would be less stressed about him and I spending time together, but she flat out refused, and demanded he delete his Instagram/Snapchat (which we regularly talked on) and only communicate through text or Facebook so we have a history. 

I asked him if he felt like things would change between them, or if she’s “the one” and he said he can see it, but there needs to be some major changes before they would even be close to being sturdy enough. 

He’s a brilliant guy and we get along like a house on fire, but recently I have caught feelings and don’t know what to do about it. I very rarely like someone and he is important to me so cutting him out isn’t an option I’d like to take.

So it's been a trying time for me. My Mother allowed me to stay with her and her boyfriend just until I can get on my feet. 

So 3 months into the stay, I've had 2 jobs, none I could keep and have been holding down minimal work doing video editing for people. I've been paying her (although not huge amounts).

So 3 days ago, she comes home late and drunk with her boyfriend and my 2 other younger siblings in the car. I ask how everything went and she tells me I have until tomorrow afternoon to leave. I at first say ""Are you sure, let's talk about it more tomorrow."" And the annoying bf loud mouth gets in my face and says ""SHE'S SURE!! WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH YOUR SHIT ANYMORE!"" 

Next day comes and my stuff is outside. I try to talk to her but I can't say anything without her asking her bf. She's become so dependent on this guy she can't even make a decision on a meal, what pill she should take, and how much (and I'm not exaggerating this I SWEAR TO GOD, I SWEAR) how many breaths of air to breathe in a minute. 

I ask her if she can let me sleep in her car for the night in exchange for $10. She tells me ""NO! YOU ARE 19, YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU CAN FIGURE YOUR OWN SHIT OUT!""

So I've spent the last day or two looking for homeless shelters in my city, and any resources for homeless people, none for Men. All for women. I slept on a park bench last night in the pouring rain. So morning comes, I knock on her door and ask to take a shower. She asks her bf On speakerphone if I can, and he says ""if it's over 10 minutes, call the police"" So I quickly shower and I start the dreaded argument with my mother.

So I told her this during the argument ""You would really let your own son, freeze out in the cold rather than let me wait just until I get my tax return (already filed) and get out""

Then she said the words that sent me into rampage ""If you die, that's your fault, I am not going to help you with your problems"" I spent the next 20 minutes cussing her out until she broke down crying.

She attempted to call the police on me for cussing her out, in her words ""Abusive behavior"" After they found me, they brought me back and assessed the situation and told me to go so everything could calm down. I asked if there were any resources for homeless people and they told me ""No.""

My parents have a history of pranking me on special occasions an I begged them to please just let me have this party as a sort of symbol that I'm not a ""little girl"" anymore and I can have an event that doesn't end in me being embarrassed. They agreed.  

I also have to say that I despise whipped frosting on cakes. Like I mean I hate it. If there's whipped frosting, I simply won't eat it. If its going to be ""my"" cake, id rather go without than have a cake with whipped frosting. I could go into great lengths into why I hate but it would probably make me sound more psycho than I am, just know I hate it. I made my mom promise that IF she got me a cake it would have legit buttercream frosting or please just don't buy one. She said she knew me well enough to know that. 

So we had the party yesterday at a hotel with an awesome pool and waterslide. When it came time for the cake my parents made all my friends gather around and they did the ""she's a jolly good fellow"" song and at the end my mom stuck her finger in the frosting and wiped it all across my face and lips and it was whipped frosting. I about barfed and said very funny where was the real cake. My dad looked at me and said something like ""you're lucky that this is the only prank we are going to play on you!"" 

I lost my shit. I hate to admit this but I embarrassed myself in front of my friends and family. It was just so embarrassing to have my mom wipe cake on my face like I'm a toddler, and then to play a prank like they promised they wouldn't and to then make it prank with one of the things I literally hate the most in the world.

She was instantly attached to him as he was to her and she took on full responsibility fir him aside from vet care because she can't afford that.

She was very good at taking care of him. Never missed a meal or a walk. The problem was that no matter how well taken care of he was, he always makes messes in the house. We tried getting him house trained many times, and we had to have puppy pads at all times and it was starting to burden us financially.

Most songs by women she butchers, but songs by men she can do fairly okay. She can belt out Patsy Cline fine and other women with more smokier voices like that.

Pretty much every conversation i have with him, he mentions her. Its been really repetitive lately. He always makes blantant jokes about liking her, around her and other people, and the jokes almost always make everyone uncomfortable. She shows almost no interest in him and has been showing that she only sees him as his best friend for years now, but he litterally won't detach from her. He always ends up trying to wrap his arm around her, or flirt with her, and she always ends up pushing him away or cringing. One time he pretty much pushed me out of my seat just to sit next to her.
I more or less want to do this so he can move on from her, and try to be with someone who will actually feel the same way about him. I just don't want to do it in a way where i would be an asshole or dick about it. WIBTA?

But their parents, my husband’s sisters, also inherited the same amount of assets that my husband did, and they have their own assets which they acquired on their own so I am not that worried for their children financially.

She told me she was glad I'd finally listened when she said her mattress was terrible. She's almost 18 and she's had the same mattress since we moved into our home when she was 7. 

When I told her it was for the guest bedroom she got upset and said that it was really cruel of me to get a new mattress for a room we wont be using much anymore.

Obviously, my parents took it really hard and they were scared I would too. At the time, I don't think I knew what was happening at all, but my parents made it a priority to have me in grief counseling, which I did up until a year after he passed. To this day, I have absolutely no memory of him. I don't know his voice, face, etc. except for what I've seen in photos or videos.

I don't know if I'm going to explain this well, but I feel like my parents have always placed more emphasis on our relationship than actually existed/exists? They always talk about how as a little kid, if I was having a fit, I'd just see him and start to calm down, or how we were ""two peas in a pod"" and inseparable, how my older brother was so excited to have a little brother to teach and how they see so mcuh of him in me or whatever.

He sounds like a great guy but I don't know that.

Anyways, my parents are hosting their annual memorial for his birthday, and they want me to speak. Before, they thought I was too young but apparently 16 is the perfect age to talk about your dead brother. I hate talking about him or the memorial with my parents because they get really sad and nostalgic and it makes me feel uncomfortable because they start up with the ""you look so much like him"" and I just feel suffocated.

I dont know if this post is allowed due to rule 3. if so please remove it and I apologize. English is also not my first language so please be paitient with me. Now here is to the issue:   


I met my now wife several years ago when she was an exhange student in my country (Sweden). Long story short we clicked, got married and I moved with her to the US. Since sunday we are also now parents to a wonderful little baby boy and everything went fine with delivery. Now the problem is that my wife is jewish, she isnt religious her self but her father is and her uncle is a rabbi. I my self is an atheist and not a vocial antagonist towards it, I just think alot of it is silly and realy dont care much about it.    


Yesterday she dropped the bomb about him getting his circumcision when her family arrived, and baffled at the time I said no way am I maiming my son, if he wants to do it when he is older by his own free will its absolutley fine, but I refuse to let anyone do such a potential dangerous thing for something silly as religon! This did not land well and we had a big fight over it, it meaning alot to her and her pepole/family. She has never expressed any religious desires like this before (we have celebrated some jewish events but we have also skipped alot out of convinience). As I see it there are tonnes of potential risks, difficulty mastrubating etc so I realy dont want this for my son.  


Now it seam strange we never discussed this earlier, and in retrospec we realy should have,  but it realy was not in my thoughts since its an uncommon practice in Sweden, unless needed for medical reasons. Even if it legaly only require one parents consent in our state, any doctor will refuse unless both parents are on board.  Essentially she called me and asshole and a friend of hers agree.

0,"AITA for saying my sister needs to stop bringing up her miscarriage for attention? | Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. 

Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. 

So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. 

So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,3,Care

I also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.

Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).

Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!

Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.

My ex would show up now and again and take my son on expensive adventures and give him expensive gifts that I could never afford. 

In spite of this, I tried to encourage the relationship and never badmouthed my ex or let my son in on the details of our relationship. I tried to be a good parent and was comforted by the advice that one day, my son would see who was really there for him.

This never happened. Now that my son is older, my ex has taken more of an interest and still takes him on expensive trips and invites him to their house more often. Recently, my son compared me to my ex and told me that my ex has always been more fun to be around. My son acknowledged that I am more loving and supportive, but essentially said that his other parent is more exciting to be around and that he always resented me for being ""strict."" I wasn't strict, genuinely, but I didn't let him do whatever he wanted like his other parent. My son bought his other parent a big, thoughtful gift for mother's/Father's Day and said that it was in return for all the money the other parent spent on him. He bought me a chocolate bar.

This hurt me very deeply, and while I wouldn't discourage my son's relationship with his parent, I'm crushed by the situation. I didn't parent so that my son would grow up and grovel at my feet, but I feel incredibly unappreciated and tossed aside because I didn't have and still don't have the money or the time that my ex does, because I had to spend all the time and money raising and providing for our child. This has all been a big blow, and I feel like I need to take some time away from my son to process. I wouldn't cut him out completely of course, but I think I need to cut back on visits and on calling him as much as I usually do for the time being.

I read over the replies to the post and thought really hard about it, although I admit I was often argumentative and didn't really want to listen for the most part. 

Meanwhile, my fiance's daughter came home shortly after I wrote the post. I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. 

I opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.

She reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that ""I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had."" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.

Since her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. 

Now that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to ""force myself"" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. 

But I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors. Without her, I wouldn't get nearly as many hugs or as much love, and more importantly, I'd have missed out on getting really close with someone as intelligent, talented, and passionate as she is. 

When she was away for the past month or so at school/traveling for the summer, I actually *really* missed her and know that my life wouldn't be the same without her.

Problem is, when we got back, he was still obsessed. He immediately started looking at dates and prices to go back. It was cute at first, until I realized he was dead a** serious and planning a trip for September, 9 months after we had JUST been there.

We are not wealthy people, very straddled with student debt and working hard to save for our dream goal of buying a small house in the next 2-3 years and creating a comfortable emergency fund, and we will need new cars soon because both of ours are dying. I work two jobs to support these goals. For our first trip, we budgeted in our wedding money and a tax refund. For this trip, we can TECHNICALLY afford it, but would have to dip into those larger savings - and Disney World is one of the most expensive destinations in the US. And again, we were JUST on vacation. Doing this would ensure we can't afford more than a long weekend here and there for the next two years, at least. He never asked how I would feel about this trip, he just decided we would go.

Here's why I feel like TA though:

1. By seeing Disney for the first time, he was totally enchanted and realized how much he missed out on as a kid. He wants to go back and see things we didn't do and get more of that Disney high. It'll make him so happy.
2. He claims this is how he wants to celebrate his dirty 30 which is around that time.
3. He wants to experience it as a couple, even though he admitted many times he had a blast with my family there.

Basically, I don't want to be the one to kill his joy.

Compromises I've suggested before people comment:

1. Taking an abbreviated Disney trip that is more affordable, and doing every money saving trick in the book.
2. Asking him to hold off a few years; they are adding tons of stuff in the next couple years and pairing that fact with time to save would make for an epic trip.
3. If we do something cheaper for his 30th we can invite his friends.

He has vetoed all of these....

This would make him so happy, and it's true it's around his birthday. AITA for totally bucking against this trip? Thanks for reading!!

Tl;Dr: Took husband to Disney World for the first time and he loved it. He now is planning a trip for nine months after we just went without consulting my opinion, and it would require dipping into savings for our future. It'll make him SO SO happy and I love him, but I consider it an irresponsible idea and don't want to go through with it. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,2,1,4,Care|Proportionality
0,"AITA for asking my brother to stop playing a made up game | I'm a college senior (21F). To save on housing costs I moved back home for my final year of college. My household/family is me, my mom, stepdad, and two brothers. My biological father is/was an abuser; I left when I was 18; because I'm the oldest, my younger brothers still see him regularly, per the custody schedule, but they aren't treated nearly as badly as I was, being the oldest and only girl. Everyone agrees on everything up to this point.

What is disputed is whether my needs are actually being dismissed, or whether I'm being unreasonable. I moved back home, as I said, and my room is in the basement. I'm taking summer classes online and will be commuting to school in the fall and spring to finish my degree - I'm a full-time student and also work 15-20 hrs/week (from home right now, although that may change depending on internship opportunities).

While I lived away, my younger brother (13) - we'll call him Winston - developed a game he calls ""QWA."" The game is throwing a yoga ball around the basement. He does this for hours. He broke several things that I left outside my room, has put holes in the walls, etc. but my family generally laughs it off like it's a totally normal thing to do. And I ignored it until I moved back home.

But now I'm back. And the first issue was that it's very upsetting to my cat, who lives with me. He's developed stress-related health issues and Winston locks him in my room for hours to play this game, and often forgets to open the door when he leaves.

The second issue is that, obviously, I am working in my room in the basement. I simply cannot work while he is throwing a yoga ball against my door, and I don't think I have to defend that.

My mother gets really upset with me when I suggest that Winston shouldn't be allowed to play this ""game"" now that I'm back. The only argument that holds any weight (imo) is that this is clearly a coping mechanism for dealing with his issues with my dad. What I would add here in my own defense is that when I was 13, I was being really, really abused - had developed an eating disorder, depression and anxiety - and she explicitly told me to just take it to ""protect my brothers."" So it's difficult for me to accept her argument that he should be allowed to do whatever he wants because my dad is sometimes mean or controlling to him. It's also relevant that I have repeatedly suggested other activities like basketball (we have a hoop) or tennis (we live near courts) which (a) would resolve this conflict and (b) probably would be better coping skills bc they are normal games and could be played with others in a healthy social environment.

Clearly I have a lot of resentment towards my mom, and clearly all of this is bogged down in decades of unhealthy dynamics. I just need people who aren't in it to tell me - am I being totally unreasonable and prying away a coping mechanism from my younger brother, OR is this a reasonable complaint to have in light of all the extenuating circumstances and possible solutions?

0,"AITA for using 1/3 of my aunt's money to fix my house? | Some background: My uncle died about a year ago with no will, no life insurance, and no savings. They owned a home together. My aunt had a job managing a convenience store but had to stop working because she got sick. With only her social security money coming in, she was in a bad way and couldn't afford her bills. This January she was very sick with cancer and I was in the position to buy a home. I purchased the home for above what it was worth because my aunt needed money. The house is run down, infested with fleas and termites, cat pee embedded into the grout and walls, a large neglected yard, and all surfaces covered in 20 yrs worth of a pack a day nicotine. I moved into one half of the house and my aunt had the other half.

Currently: She passed away last week. With no will despite all of the family begging her to make one for the past 4 months. She had listed me as POA and beneficiary of her bank accounts because she believed I would make the good choices about the money from the home sale. Before she passed, we had discussed improvements she wanted to do to the home, such as remodeling the kitchen because of a decade old leaky dishwasher that ruined the cabinets and wall behind them and rescreening the back porch (she placed a deposit on this before she passed).

About 70k is left. About 4-5k is going to fix up her cats for adoption (they all 4 have several medical problems), 2k for the cremation, 10k to hold back for the family to come together and scatter her ashes sometime next year, 25k for me to fix the house, and 20k min for 8 of the cousins/step kids to split. There is about 9k left over that if no other expenses are foreseen, would also go into the cousin fund. So the cousins would get 2,500 -3,675 each

There is also an SUV that my aunt paid off and verbally said she would give to my mom. Mom thinks it is too big for her, so I offered to trade my car to her for the SUV.

My other aunts are mad because I am taking so much money AND getting the car. (The car was a deal just between my mom and I.) I need the money to fix the house into a livable condition and I would be doing most of the repairs myself to save expenses. There would be no money to split if I hadn't purchased the house. I feel that because the house needs so many repairs and because my aunt was going to do these repairs if she had survived , I should take the money and get the house in good condition. If I had not wanted to help my aunt out of poverty, I would have purchased a home that was in good shape. 

My other aunts want the ~55k to be split evenly between just the 6 cousins, leaving out my uncles kids from a previous marriage. The step kids got nothing from their father's death and I felt they should get something.

Basically a year ago I did a study abroad program. I had a couple of pet fish I had to leave behind. When I came home I reclaimed my pets, but my younger sister had grown attached to one so she asked to keep it. I said yes, as long as my parents helped with taking care of it. They agreed. For the record it is a pretty low level fish in terms of care; a betta that is in a 5 gallon tank with a filter.

I live two hours away for school. Routinely my mother will text me I need to come home to clean the aquarium. I remind her I offered to take him back with me, and they wanted him so it is not my responsibility. Regardless she will say things like ‘if you don’t come clean it the fish is just going to die’. Among expletives calling me lazy/ungrateful for not just doing it for them.

In the past I have come and done it just to ensure the fish’s health. Most of the time the tank isn’t even dirty; the 9 year old leaves the light on so algae grows on the glass and they take that to mean it’s ‘dirty’.

He agrees and tells me to pick. I show him one that I liked, it was in another terminal but we had time so he agreed.

&#x200B;

We get off the plane, he starts complaining how it was too far away and his foot was bothering him. He points out another restaurant, I asked if he wanted to go there instead. He says no. As we are walking more, I told him I wasnt married to that other restaurant and if he sees something else he likes along the way to pick that one. He says no, he wants to go where I want to eat. He complains more, I offer to take bags from him as he was carrying most of it, he says no. 

&#x200B;

We get separated in the crowd, I thought he was right behind me, but I turn around and hes not there. I start to wait, but then I see the restaurant is about 30 steps further so I go ahead and wait outside there next to the menu. He comes up and starts to bitch about me ditching him. I apologize and explained the restaurant was so close I thought it was ok to wait here. He told me I did it on purpose and I was really insensitive to his foot pain.

&#x200B;

 We are looking at the menu, usually we brainstorm toddler dishes, I mention they don’t have anything for toddler and he gets angry and storms off saying we walked all this way for nothing  and how Im insensitive to his pain, I told him I felt like I was giving him options to accommodate his pain but he refused them. 

&#x200B;

I say we need to get toddler food. He says ‘fine go get her food then!’ I point out the bistro nearby and start to head over. I look back and he’s still at the other spot. I was picking stuff out when I realized I didn’t have my phone or wallet. I start searching for him, toddler in tow, circling around for over 30 min. Finally decide to head back to our gate.  We see each other about half way to the gate, Before I can say anything, he starts laying into me about how I abandoned him and did this all on purpose. I ask why would I abandon him when he has all my stuff and I felt like he had done that to me since he was so pissed at me. He doesnt understand why I stayed over in that area looking for him for so long. I felt like he must not have even looked for us long because I was right where I said I’d be and was only there for under 10 min.

I say I’m sorry that this happened I understand I fucked up, but we both messed up in this. He refuses to believe that saying I was disgusting for not being able to take all the blame since this was all my fault. I told him I felt we shared equal blame. He stops talking to me. We get on the plane and I get two texts from him saying he really hated me right now and that he could not find one good reason to love me, this is the worst day of our marriage.

My daughter is an infant and also requires a good deal of attention and care. My husband and I have had our kids in full-time daycare for the entire year. 

I told my husband that I was going to buy the daycare teachers thank you Christmas gifts. He agreed it was a good idea because they have been so patient and loving to our kids. We didn't discuss a budget. 

There are three rotating teachers in each class. I gave a $25 dollar gift card and a small tube of $5 hand cream to each teacher. I purchased $2 wrapping paper and $2 for bows at a discount store. I spent about $187.

My husband was furious that I spent so much on them. I disagree. These teachers work really hard and they watch our kids just as much as we do.

1,"AITA for speaking to my sister about my wife's financial concerns for an event that my wife said she couldn't afford to attend? | My (31M) wife (34F) was recently invited to my younger sister's (29F) hen do happening this month. She showed me the invite, and almost immediately stated to me that there was no way she could go as she had no money and wouldn't be able to afford it, and how everyone else will have money to do things and she won't.

&#x200B;

(She's concerned as she only works a few hours each weekend, and the money she gets often goes (but not always) for household/kid's needs. She has access to our ""joint account"", which is where my salary goes in, and which pays for all rent/bills/car payments/everything else.)

&#x200B;

I would love for her to go, especially as she's been wanting some time away from the kids and normal routine, so I messaged my older sister (40F) who is planning the hen do and asked how much money my wife would need for the day, so that my wife would know what to expect/budget for. She replied that it's a very low key affair, mostly at her home, but one part will have a small cost and she'd be happy to pay for my wife because she'd love for her to come. I replied asking to know any costs and that I'd contribute as well if needed. It ends up that the cost would be less than £20.

&#x200B;

Today she mentioned that she had asked her coworkers about it (although she had phrased it in terms of me controlling what money she could or couldn't have) and of course they all sided with her. She was still adamant that I had ""done wrong"" by ""going behind her back"" to have me or my sister pay for her, and that she wasn't a ""charity case"". She then said that she'd pay for it herself anyway, or that she'd just use the joint account(!).  By the end of the argument, she was in a foul mood, and I'm back in the doghouse again. My argument to her was that my sister's generosity was borne out of no bad intention, and that me getting involved was was also not ill-intentioned.

My initial feeling was that my wife is being pretty rude and ungrateful, but I understand that there's always some embarrassment when you feel that you can't afford something that someone then pays for you.

My mom is 65 and has never kept a steady job. She refuses to learn how to use a computer and is therefore constantly asking me to look up everything for her. She has no skills.

Before coming to visit she talked about getting a place with a friend. She told me that fell through because the friend would not respond. Two days after she arrived, she ignored a call from her friend saying ""that's 8 times...""

I knew it would not be easy having my mom around, but she has made my life incredibly difficult. She refuses to do anything for herself. That includes looking stuff up, but also driving places, doing the dishes, taking out the trash, and picking up after herself.

She constantly ignores what I say, like the fact that I'm in a diet. I pay for everything, and I generally dont mind. However, she complains about how much everything costs, but then in the next breath suggests we do something expensive. I've been slowly getting angrier and yelling some.

I explained that I cannot get any space from her, physically emotionally or mentally. She didn't really respond. I gave her until the morning and said we would talk then.

Great company, great position, amazing money (more than TWICE my current salary). Chances of me finding anything comparable right now are next to none. Normally it would be a no-brainer for me to accept it.

The catch: as part of the induction/training for this role, I would have to go on a 2-week business trip in the second half of January, abroad, potentially even to the US (I’m in Europe), leaving my wife completely alone with a 2-month-old baby, and 2 dogs, for 2 weeks. I’m VERY uncomfortable with this idea and it makes me feel at best like an asshole and at worst as a monster.

Important details: she would be pretty much completely alone and nobody would be able to help. Our families are not in the picture, they live too far away to be able to assist. We don’t have any friends locally (at least not close enough to help with baby and house management), nor any sufficiently friendly neighbours. We have 2 dogs, and no garden, so the dogs need to be walked, at least twice a day. She would have to manage the baby, the apartment, the dogs, any shopping and what-not, cooking, and basically anything and everything else, all by herself.

She’s saying she “will manage”, she’s happy that I got the job offer and is telling me I should take it. I’m not sure she really comprehends the challenge of having a newborn in the house all by herself. I never had children of my own, but as a frequenter of r/beyondthebump, I’ve read enough to be seriously worried.

The alternative is to ditch this job offer and keep looking for something that would not imply any frequent or long business trips, but the downsides are quite obviously also severe – the offer is just too good to refuse. She says I should take the job, whereas my parents share my concerns and told me it sound very selfish and irresponsible. Reddit - would I be the asshole if I took this job?

0,"AITA for saying I would break up with a SO if he declawed a cat he adopted | I’ve had cats around me for my whole life. I volunteered at a cat shelter for awhile after college. I have done enough research to come to the conclusion that declawing a cat is tantamount to abuse of said cat. 
I was in a relationship with a man and he was talking about getting a cat, but wanted it to be declawed. I had been seeing him for about 3 months when this came up. I told him in no uncertain terms that I thought it was cruel and would not stay in a relationship with him if he did that to an animal. I further explained that if it was that big of a deal to him, there is a local shelter that at any given time has some number of declawed cats and I would support him adopting one of those so long as he had the knowledge to support one of these cats ( understood that they sometimes have litter box trouble, understanding the danger they’re in if they get outside and willing to make accommodations to deal with the issues)
He was livid and thought I was ridiculous for putting a relationship with a person who I might otherwise have been happy with on the line over such an issue. I think it speaks to the type of person he was and didn’t back down. It blew up and led to the deterioration and eventual end of our relationship

We've interviewed someone who is perfect for the job, I've actually worked with him before and he's great, ideal for the job and our future plans. He would bring skills and knowledge to our business that would be extremely beneficial. However, I have since discovered that he is engaged to a very unsavoury lady (how or why, baffles me).


Based on this, I dont want to hire him.


She has actually physically attacked me in the past with a bottle (at random), to the point I was actually pressing charges against her (which were eventually dropped by myself), it affected me so much that I didn't want to go out in my home town for several months. Another friend of mine has had a similar experience with her too so it's not an isolated event. She's violent and unpredictable. I still have a scar on the back of my head from the attack.


The culture of our company involves partners quite regularly for lunches, dinners, weekend retreats etc so avoiding her would be impossible and quite frankly I dont want anything to do with this person, ever. 


Ultimately, I'm responsible for day to day management and the final decision is my call, but my partners feel I'm being unreasonable and I should let bygones be bygones for the sake of the business, but I'm threatened and intimidated by this individual and being the co owner of this business, I dont think I should put myself in that situation.

The first day of my new job was an orientation and I was surprised to see that she was going to be working there as well. After our first training shift together, she started to explain her family hardships and how difficult it had been not having her license. I’ve been in this boat before: I got a DUI myself when I was a teenager, and it took me years to save up enough to buy a new car and reinstate my license and I definitely learned from my mistake right away. She has had not one, not two, but three DUI’s in a row. I honestly felt bad for her and offered her a ride home that day, not really caring if she was out of the way, but she explained she was “right off ____ street” as well. So that day I gave her a ride home. Now, she asks me for a ride every time we work together, which has been every single shift. We do live off the same road, but her house is 15 minutes in the opposite direction so I have to leave 30 minutes early and arrive home 30 min late at night. It’s especially frustrating that I often see her moms or her brothers cars in the driveway when I pull up, which means she probably could have found another ride. She’s given me a $5 bill twice, which I appreciate, but my car is a gas-guzzler and that’s not really covering what I’m paying to give her rides every day.  Also, we had a menu test that I had spent all night studying for and she said she was “just gonna copy off of me”. I tried to move to another table and she moved too... right next to me. Would I be the asshole if I said something to her? It gives me major anxiety but I do feel kind of like I’m being taken advantage of.

1,"AITA because I hid the tracking system my ex wife uses for our son. | We have an 8 year  old together. He has a medical condition but it is controlled by medication though. 

He is always not a very independent child. Mostly because my ex wife hovers a lot. She can’t have anymore children. I know that is a huge deal for her and those two are super close. She actually has primary custody and I get visitation pretty much anytime I want. 

I have a demanding job that takes me away a lot and she works close to the school and has a very flexible office job: 

When he started school, she bought him a tracking watch. It is a watch that tracks his location and has a white list of people he can call and that can call him. It has been two years now and it is nice to be able to call him directly instead of going through her. And my father loves being able to text him silly emojis and receive them from him. 

I am fine with him having a watch but I think he is 8 now and he should and can learn to do more on his own. 

I’ve not been letting him take it to my house lately even though he begs to. 

I just don’t think she needs to be able to track him all the time.

Last weekend I tried to talk to her about him not taking it to school but she said that since he goes to an aftercare program that he may need to contact her. 

I also understand that her brother disappeared when he was younger and is still a missing person. I believe he was 9, maybe 10. I get why she is nervous that our son may also go missing but I explained that it is so rare for that to happen that she shouldn’t let it impact our son. 

To help her along, I took the watch and hid it and asked her to go a week without tracking him and then I would return. 

She has completely lost it. I know that if she can just see for a week that he is fine. That he gets where he needs to be just fine and that nothing is going to happen to him, that she will be better for it. And he will too.

0,"WIBTA for missing my daughter’s wedding to prepare for the bar exam? | I’m a non-traditional 3L attending a law school on the East Coast. Previously, I spent about two decades working in a separate but related field, and becoming an attorney has been a long-desired career change for me. My ex and I had our daughter when I was in my late teens, and while I was able to finish my undergraduate degree, I found it incredibly challenging to juggle being a parent and a full-time student, and I opted to postpone all further education until my daughter was an adult and I could devote my full attention to my studies. 

My daughter and her fiance live in California, where they plan to get married, and recently announced that they’ve set their wedding date for Sunday, July 26, and put a deposit down on their venue. Unfortunately, this falls two days before I’m scheduled to take my state’s bar exam. I was not consulted about the date in advance. I asked if the date could be moved to a different weekend and was told no because it coincides with the availability of a big chunk of her fiancé’s extended family, who are traveling from out of the country, and the venue was already booked for Friday and Saturday that weekend. 

This creates a huge problem, because I really need to dedicate the last few days prior to the exam to studying, and I’m concerned that if I spend that Monday traveling, I’ll go into the exam the next day exhausted and run the risk of failing. I tried to explain this to my daughter, but she became very angry and upset and said if I really cared about her, I would be there. I do care about her! I do want to be there!

I feel absolutely terrible about the timing, and I’ve tried to come up with some compromises — I offered to fly out a few weeks beforehand to assist her with wedding planning, fly out and spend time with the two of them when they get back from their honeymoon, and Skype or FaceTime in to the rehearsal dinner, ceremony, and reception.

Anyways my husband and I have been together for 3 years, married for only 5 months. When I first met him we were still coworkers and his wife was already very, very sick (intestinal cancer).

She passed away ~2 months after I first met my now husband. 

We stayed good friends and I supported him through this time (platonically only) until we started dating roughly a year after his wife passed away. We both felt a lot of guilt for finding love after loss so quickly but we were inseparable and still are.

1,"AITA for letting my friend's cat eat a whole steak? | My friend and I disagree strongly on this, and as we both lurk this subreddit, we saw no better way to solve the argument than right here.

Some background information. I've never owned a pet before so I don't know completely how one is supposed to be treated. This past week, I was staying at friend A's house for a few days with her parents, and they owned a cat. It was super friendly, so I wasn't worried about being bitten or anything, but I never carried it around or really handled it in any way either. Friend B was also present. For the first three days I was there, the cat would always come up to the table while we were eating and paw on our chairs to get some of the food. When it came up to us, the family would shoo it away. But it would come over time and time again to beg, and I honestly felt bad for it.

Here's where the fuck up happened. The parents made some steaks and put it on plates for us to eat. When we were finished eating, there was only one steak left on the plate. Around 10 minutes after we finished eating, something happened that drew everyone's attention to a different room; it was important, but also none of my business, so I stayed behind at the table. Seeing this opportunity, the cat walks over, and jumps from the floor, to an empty chair, to the table, and starts eating the last steak. My first instinct was to tell the family, but they were super engrossed in what they're doing. So not wanting to disturb them, and frankly not seeing the situation as urgent, I just let the cat keep eating the steak. Admittedly, friend A's dad walked through room at some point and didn't notice the cat; I could have told him, but had never really talked to him before, and felt uncomfortable doing so.

By the time everyone comes back, the cat actually finished the entire steak and had begun licking the plate clean. Apparently, they didn't want the cat eating people food at all, and were shocked after realizing it finished the whole thing. The parents weren't mad at me, but friend B says I'm TA for letting the cat eat it. She argues that I should have known that the cat wasn't allowed to eat people food given how everyone was treating it, and that someone else might have wanted the steak for later; I should have told the dad, or just moved it myself. As I see it, I shouldn't have been expected to know how to treat someone else's pet, and even if I did I shouldn't be expected to physically move it away from the table. If someone wanted the steak, they should have put it somewhere where the cat couldn't reach it, given they had time to before leaving it alone. Plus the damn thing wanted human food the whole time I was there, and I didn't want to take the moment away from it. AITA?

0,"AITA for shouting at my mother that her new belief (NATUROPATHY) is a scam? | To give some background to the story, my mother never worked in her life, my father was able to provide for the family and she preferred looking after us and the house. So after me and my sister left our parents home (I moved to another country, my sister in a small town nearby my parents), start working was not an option for her because she's now in her 50s with no skills and/or qualifications. I guess being alone in the house made her pretty bored and I think also a bit depressed. 

So when she came up with this idea of going to this (very expensive) evening Naturopathy course, I was not totally against it although I thought it was silly. I just hoped it could be an hobby for her and entertain her. This was 3 years ago and I think things are degenerating. 

She's now obsessed with gluten, she's not celiac or gluten intolerant but at this course someone told her that gluten is bad and causes every sort of disease so now she would not touch it and does not allow my father to touch it neither. She spends hundreds of Euros in vitamins and food supplements because apparently this cure everything and are detox etc. She believes that negative thoughts are also the cause of every sort of disease and that if you think positive and eat following her diet (which is just everything except gluten and sugar) you can cure every disease. This seems harmless because she's not sick. However, she recently convinced my grandmother to stop taking all her drugs (my grandmother is old and has some problems with her blood pressure, back, and lungs). She recently told my father to stop taking one of his medications (he has colitis) because apparently 'the doctor want to sell this medicine to take money from the pharmaceutical company"". And now she wants to spend 450€ for a chromotherapy pen sold by a friend of one her teachers. This is just a pen with a light on top of it. And it's 450€ for the beginner one. Then she needs to buy one for 1,500€. These are just few examples of her new obsession with Naturopathy.

After realising things are now degenerating, I tried my best to explain that there are no evidences that the things these people teach her at this course work. That a pen with lights can't cure diseases and there are no researches made on any of the theories she reads about. I tried to convince her that my father and grandmother need their medications. I tried to talk rationally and be calm. As a result, I was treated like a close minded person that can't see over what 'corrupted people' (every doctor, scientist, pharmacist etc) tell me. 

At this point I just lost it and started shouting at her saying Naturopathy is a scam and that people that are selling her the chromotherapy pen are probably laughing at her for buying a 'magic' plastic pen for a ridiculous price etc. She is now very upset and is avoiding me.

It has only changed weekends a couple of times in the last 2 decades, causing chaos, sooo they don't change it idly.

I love this trip. I look forward to it every year, because it's often the only vacation hubby and I get. This year however, the camping trip weekend falls 6wks after my due date. 

I made an idle comment to MIL a couple weeks before Christmas about us planning on coming, and massively looking forward to it, while simultaneously hoping that I'll feel up to us coming...basically a hope and plan for the best but mentally prepare for the worst type conversation.

0,"WIBTA for accepting a very generous gift? | I work in a store where, we provide a service and have to go up to a counter to greet customers to take their orders. It’s a small department (3/4 employees). There is one customer who always wanted (26/f)me to help him (70s/M). I’ve been at this store almost 6 years, and he’s requested me for atleast the last 3. Hes probably been a customer for 20 years.

I don’t think anything weird of this because we all have our “regular customers”. As the years go by we are friendly with each other. He has always bought gifts around holidays for the entire store to share. (Cookies at Christmas, candy at Halloween, etc). A year or 2 ago, he started adding little extra gifts just for me. He always talks to me for longer than most customer, about his life and things going on in the world and I don’t cut him off because it’s my job to be nice to our customers. It’s usually just me listening and reacting to what he says, not me telling personal stuff about myself.

Fast forward to last August, I got engaged. He comes in and sees the ring on my finger, and the usual 20 min conversation was a 2. I didn’t think much of it because there are times he’s been in a rush. 3 months go by and he hasn’t been back in. He finally comes in and asks to speak with me privately. He confesses his love for me and how he’s never met anyone like me in his life, and how he thought we had something and how he thought I was single. Overall very overwhelming conversation because it wasn’t on my radar AT ALL. I didn’t tell anyone at work about this because I didn’t want weird vibes and figured I could handle this myself by still helping him but occasionally avoiding him and letting others help him. His visits have been shorter, and obviously a little weird but he hasn’t stopped being a regular customer.

Yesterday he came in before I got to work and asked for me and my coworkers told him I would be in later. So he came back later, dropped off work to do and gave me a card and left.

0,"WIBTA if I refused to give my mum a fridge that she bought us 10 years ago as a gift? | So this may be the most vanilla post on AITA ever and I apologise, but I’m [31F] a very conflict-averse person (particularly with regards to my mum [60F] for reasons outlined below) so it’s kind of a big deal for me. 

I’ll preface this by stating that my mum feels easily slighted and can cross boundaries. She finds it difficult to accept when she has mistreated someone and can escalate dramatically when confronted. I tend to walk on eggshells and constantly deny my own wants/needs/emotions so that she feels comfortable. I am aware that this is not helpful but it’s a lifelong pattern that’s difficult to break. 

My mum went into early retirement several years ago as she lives comfortably on her investments. 

10 years ago my husband and I moved into our home and mum bought us a fridge as a gift. We were students at the time. We live in a small, modest house but I have spent a great deal of time and energy honing the aesthetics of our home. I’ve always been interested in interior decorating. I struggle with my mental health and my home helps me feel calm, happy, and in control. BUT I recognise that I am perfectionistic and pedantic about things looking a certain way. Im hyperaware of small details. The fridge is simple and white and blends in with our white kitchen which is part of an open plan kitchen-dining-living. It sounds silly but I love our fridge. 

Recently mum has started talking about moving into her rental property. She has a problem because her current fridge is too big to fit in the fridge recess at the rental. She has announced (not asked) that when she moves we‘re going to swap fridges with her because ours is smaller. She’s brought it up a handful of times and each time I tell her how much I like our fridge but she doesn’t relent. Her fridge is steel (not white) and would visually make a big impact in our small space. 

WIBTA if I refused to let her swap fridges with us? It could potentially lead to her blowing up, with possible silent treatment/acts of revenge and definite bad mouthing to relatives.

At the end of the day I know it’s just a fridge and she paid for it, but I feel like it’s an AH move to take back a gift, particularly in the way she decided it was happening and informed us rather than asking us if it would be ok. 

My therapist says I need to learn to create boundaries with my mum but that usually relates to her saying nasty things (for example insulting my appearance or criticising my baby). However in this instance there is something tangible to lose so I have more motivation. But perhaps this is the wrong hill to die on and I’m an asshole for being concerned about a fridge.",False,False,4,3,3,2,1,3,Care

Obligatory on mobile so formatting might be screwed up :) 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now. Things are going well but he has a big problem with how much I use my phone. I agree that I do use it a lot, and that scrolling through reddit or twitter all day is an addiction. However, there are a lot of useful things I use my phone for as well. 

I have a set morning routine where I listen to a daily news podcast, do the NYT crossword, and do my Duolingo French lessons. This is whole routine takes about an hour in the morning. I understand that he wants to talk to me in the mornings and I end up on my phone, but the routine helps me. I feel much more productive throughout the day because I start it off doing something productive. 

After I’m done with this routine, I agree that using my phone beyond that is harmful and I need to reduce the amount I spend on reddit and Twitter drastically. He says that I should do my routine in the evening or before sleeping. This makes no sense to me, because I need to limit my screen time before sleeping, and also listening to the previous days news in the evening, or doing the crossword when I’m tired from the day doesn’t seem logical. 

My boyfriend says that even though I’ve been admitting for a while that there’s a problem I haven’t been working towards fixing it. He says that a big reason for my addiction is that I spend an hour in the morning on my phone. I agree that it might have an effect but I don’t think that changing that to a nightly routine will help.

He's never been in a relationship or lived with someone before now and I think that he just needs to give it some time so he can get used to the new space and sharing a bed with someone but he thinks the solution is that we sleep in separate rooms.

The other part is that the spare room isn't a spare room it's my lab where I work on all my biology experiments and do my writing and there is no room for a bed there without me giving up my hobbies and there is one other room but it's his office and he isn't willing to give it up for the extra bed and is putting it on me... I think the solution here is to give it some more time for things to settle and maybe to get him a pair of earplugs.

We have known for years but it's not something that we talk about in my family because my brother is embarrassed of it in a way. He is EXTREMELY smart and always has been. He excels in math and physics and everything in between. He is going to college and taking hard classes that he does well in. Lately, he has been depressed. More than depressed. A couple of months ago, he tried to take his own life by getting drunk and swallowing a bottle of acetaminophen. He and I are extremely close and he only talks to me. He called me in a panic hours after doing this and I took him to the hospital. He went to outpatient treatment after getting discharged from inpatient. The nurse had called me and asked if my brother was diagnosed with autism ever because he shows some clear signs. I talked to my brother about it today and he is still somewhat denying that he has autism.

My brother loves me to death and I love him just as much. He has always looked up to me. I can't imagine a world without him. He loves how much more alike we get as we get older. He constantly says it with a big smile on his face. I have tried to talk to him about his autism and how he shouldn't be ashamed and he should own that about himself because some people don't even realize he has bad communication skills and he's so damn smart.

0,"WIBTA for not having another kid? | Repost bc I exceeded character limits. 

I have a 3 year old. His biological father is not in the picture and basically never has been. I've always been content with that and started looking to date again when he was around 9 months old. I wasn't expecting to hit the jackpot but I did. My husband is the best man I've ever known and we are the absolute best of friends. He took my son in as his own and loves him to death. I'm so so grateful for him every day and my son adores him. It's just an overall awesome situation I never thought would happen. 

Okay. So my husband has always gone back and forth about wanting to have a child of his own. I've gone back and forth about it too since I had my son and ultimately I really, sincerely do not want to have another one. I have a lot of varying reasons for this.

 My husband does want one of his own. Mostly for the ""novelty"" of having a child with someone you love, passing on genes etc. A child who is biologically his that he helped create. I totally understand why he would want that and I empathize completely with how he feels. Although other times he will say it sounds nice, but he could really live without it and it's not the upmost important thing to him, he sees more benefits to NOT having another one etc. I think he feels like that sincerely at times but deep down he still wants one of his own. 

Today it came up again after a long period of time of not discussing it at all. We were talking about some bad shit happening in the world and I said that it's another reason I feel I don't want another child. From there it spiraled. My husband said that I'm denying him the opportunity to have one of his own. He said that I don't want another one because I'm lazy and simply don't want to put in the effort to raise another child. It got nasty. By the end of it after we both kind of cooled down the tone was basically ""if it happens it happens, if it doesn't it's whatever"" but now I feel this massive weight of pressure and guilt that I'm not sure how to get past. 

I get where he's coming from. I truly do. And I know theres a big possibility that down the road he will end up resenting me if I don't decide to have another child. But I absolutely cannot force myself to want it. I can't make myself have a kid out of obligation. There is no part of me that wants another kid. Honestly, I didn't ever want to have kids in the first place but shit happens I guess. I love being a mom, I love my son to death. I know there is a possibility one day I'll change my mind, and I accept that, but I don't want my husband to bank on that happening.

Yesterday, while I (19F) was on a walk with my little brother (10M) and I told him that he has ADHD. My parents got him diagnosed last year and while they have been making efforts to help succeed in school, they get mad at him for exhibiting textbook symptoms of ADHD. I moved away for college last fall and haven't seen the full scope of things, but since I've moved back home, my parents have been yelling at my brother for not being able to finish tasks, calling him stupid, and grounding him for weeks over trivial issues. I talked to my brother about it and he's told me that while I'm away the yelling is more frequent. I decided that I would give him an explanation behind what was going on, mainly because I feel like he deserves to know, and it would explain things to him, rather that keep him thinking that ""mom and dad hate me and I don't know why"". I explained to him that having ADHD doesn't make you a bad person, it just makes your thinking process a bit different.

Fast forward to today,  and while I was out on a walk, my brother confided  to our parents about what  we talked about on our walk yesterday.

I took her to the vet, and she was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. That was a couple years ago.

0,"AITA for using my wheelchair despite my parents' telling me not to? | I'm 21 & Im starting uni. Ive moved back in with my parents. I use a chair in public. I do have the ability to walk, & tend to walk around the house because it is carpeted & has stairs (its a struggle for me).  
 

What happened with my legs- I'm weak. My legs collapse frequently & even if they don't, I'm in constant pain 24/7 if I walk. To the point of crying. I have been to my GP & have been instructed to STAY IN THE CHAIR, until we figure out what the fuck is up with me. I'm not stated as disabled on any of my docs cause I have no diagnosis yet, but have docs from my GP for chair use.  
 

Now the real meat of this is my parents. When we (S/O and I) were moving back in with them, they said to take one of the wheelchairs in the airport to skip ahead of the line. I then had to drop the bombshell that I actually have my own chair & have to use it because my legs are crap. My parents did not like this.   
 

Some info, they see me as an abusive person because I refused to bend over & let them continously treat me like shit (making decisions for me, cutting me off from my family). Saying that I took advantage of them. Anyway, since I've moved back in, they are insistent about me not using my chair.

Last night, I was talking about my classmates to them, I was attending everyday, using public transport to get to my campus. My mom then asks me to never use my chair again, saying I shouldn't take advantage of people & I should stop pretending & just be ""normal"". My dad goes into this rant about how I just want to take advantage of people's kindness, stating I'm a cruel person for using the chair. I tried telling my dad that being disabled is difficult & he then said ""then stop pretending & just work through it!"" I insisted that its too painful to ever do that & I have to listen to my doctor until I figure out what's up. He went on about how karma will bite me in the ass & that I will be unloved, jobless in the world cause of the chair. He then instructed me to ditch the chair in the next week, & to lie to all my mates that I am on medication & can walk. I refused.

John is a spender - eats out nearly every day, gets nicest/name brand everything, regularly updates wardrobe, etc. I’m a saver. I buy maybe five new items of clothing each year, I don’t eat fast food, and I’m used to putting away hundreds of dollars in savings each month.

We both had full time jobs with comparable pay and John had a side job as well. We decided to combine our full time income that we budgeted together and agreed that John could use his side income for whatever he wanted, so that usually went to food and clothes (things we budgeted for together, but not enough for his lifestyle in his opinion). He’d often blow through our joint money too, but I tried to be patient with him since I knew we both weren’t used to having our spending affect someone else. 

I took out cash for something and ended up with $10 leftover. I told John and he said I should treat myself with that.

I used to work for the private school in question. One of the perks was heavily discounted tuition for my kids. So both of my older sons went to the school and have graduated.

Last year, I got a new job in a different school. It's a very good state school. It was an incredibly good career jump for me. My husband works remotely so he had no issues moving. My son was just about to start his final year of highschool but after much thinking and getting his input, we ended up moving because I don't think I'd ever get a career opportunity like that again.

Everything was going well until it was time for college applications.

We were very surprised to hear that my son wanted to go to the same private school as his brothers. The out of state tuition for that school without my discount is absolutely unaffordable for us. Especially with some recent medical bills we had.

He then proceeded to list another private school in our state but again, we cannot afford that kind of tuition. 

We were never the kind of family that put emphasis on ivy league schools. And our son was never vocal about going to private schools either. Both my husband and I went to state schools.

I told him the school I work for is excellent and we'd save a lot of money with my benefits.

This conversation ended very poorly. He said he would have never agreed to the move if we'd told him this would happen. This was a mistake on our part I must admit.

Our son went ahead and applied to the private school anyway and got accepted. But my husband and I were firm that we would not be cosigning any student loans. We are not in a place to do that.

He's made accusations of favoritism which I refuse to accept. Our kids went to schools based on what we could afford at the time.

Our son ended up going to the school I work at and is doing very poorly. He hates the school and has generally stopped talking to my husband and I. His brothers have tried talking to him and he's just lashed out at them, accusing then of using all of our funds. That's created a whole other conflict.

My husband got told by our son that he might be failing some midterms. It's extremely disappointing because our youngest has always been the most academically gifted.

0,"AITA for telling my bf I’m worried about how much he drinks? | Just wanting a little insight on something that happend recently.

My bfand I had not had a fight until this past weekend and I still feel a little weird about it. We both still live at home so most weekends we sleep at each others’ place, more often than not my house. Each time my bf comes over he brings 4-6 beers and sometimes a bottle of wine or cider as well.

It didn’t bother me at first but recently I’ve started to notice some things. Note that I don’t drink alcohol, so I don’t really know much about what is considered normal when it comes to drinking habits.

Last weekend he stayed over, we planed on going to dinner with my parents and he took a shower before he left but he took a cider in the shower with him. He even told my parents he was taking a cider into the shower with him because he likes to drink something cold when he’s having a hot shower. Again I don’t drink so I don’t know if this is a normal thing people who drink do. Before we left he had 3 drinks and 2 at dinner. 

After his 2 drinks there he had his head in his hand and tried to stay awake. We asked him to take a break from beer and have water which he did, but would have sips of my mother’s drink. Not ask her, but would look at her and slowly slide her drink towards him without verbally asking if he could have a sip.

We came home around 10:30 pm and by this time he sobered up a bit and grabbed his last cider in the fridge. I asked him if he thinks he should have another one since we were all going to bed soon and he already had 5 drinks. He snapped at me in front of my mother, I told him to have the cider if he wanted and we both went to my room. He did drink it later.

I asked him to honestly tell me how much he drinks a week and he said he has about 3 drinks a day on days he’s not working (about 3-4 days a week) and that the reason he drinks more when he’s around me is because he feels relaxed around me and he likes to drink when he’s relaxed. He then went on to explain how many standard drinks are in what he has and says it’s mostly out of his system within the hour so he can handle alcohol more than I think.

1,"AITA for refusing to support my daughter's career ambitions? | I am a doctor and my husband is an accountant. Our daughter Lily is 18 and wants to be a doctor like mumma, and is working on her university application, but I don't think medicine is a good fit for her. 

Let me start by saying I'm not saying this because I don't think she could achieve it. She absolutely could. She is studying A levels in biology, chemistry and history, and is top of the class in the first two and near the top in the third. She has always been a bright kid and we are very proud of her. 

That said, although she has the aptitude for it, I don't think it would be a good fit for her personality wise. She is, unfortunately, very lazy and her intellect is very much natural talent. She does not revise at all. Her routine on schoolnights is to come home, and immediately get changed and go out to smoke weed with her friends, and going to sleep as soon as she gets home. She doesn't make much of an effort in school and has a bit of a truancy problem. 

We and her teachers were convinced that this was because the work was too easy and she wasn't being challenged, but when she completed work tasks early they trialled giving her more advanced university-level material and relevant tasks, but even that failed to stimulate her once she learned the material and was able to complete the tasks. Husband and I agree that the problem isn't that she isn't being challenged, but that she is hedonistic and enjoys her easy life. That's great, but medicine isn't a career which requires only intellect. It requires a lot of hours, dedication and sacrifice, and since Lily is too used to simply using her talents to coast by I'm worried it will hit her hard when she starts working. 

Also, while I'm sure we've all met a nasty doctor or nurse in the past, generally the health field is one which you need a good deal of empathy and care for others to thrive in. Lily can be lovely, but she also has a mean streak. A few years back we got calls from the school a few times about Lily getting into trouble for bullying. Nothing extremely serious, but serious enough that the school felt the need to inform us which they don't do for minor issues.

I've been in the industry long enough to know that the young ones who try to bring that ''popular kid'' mentality onto the hospital floor either crash and burn after not too long or go on to inflict serious damage to their patients and colleagues. I don't want either of those outcomes happening to my daughter. 

Lately I've been trying to convince Lily to change her mind. With her talents, she could do really well in something like research, but she is adamant on becoming a doctor. Yesterday we had a discussion about it which turned to an argument, and she ended up crying in my husband's arms saying I don't believe she's good enough to be a doctor, which isn't true at all. 

Husband and I had a long talk, and he's convinced that I should let her follow her dreams like I got to do, but I'm just not sure it's the right thing.",False,False,4,3,2,3,2,4,Care|Proportionality

1,"AITA for not wanting my wife to book a hotel by herself for a night away? | Hello Reddit,

&#x200B;

So my wife is pregnant and is in her third trimester. She has recently been complaining about how stressed she is and how she needs a break. She says she needs a night away in a hotel by herself.

&#x200B;

I find the night away in a hotel by herself to be strange, especially seeing that I was talking about taking her away for a ""babymoon"" next weekend where we would both getaway and leave our 2 year old with grandma and grampa. Further, I tell her that I would rather use our vacation fund for joint holidays and not seperate trips and that I don´t want to set a precendent of taking seperate trips like this - I am uncomfortable with the idea. She is furious and says this is not a seperate trip and she needs this, but I tell her that is how I view it.

&#x200B;

After all this I inform her that I would be happy to give her a break this weekend - for both Saturday and Sunday I promise to take care of all responsibility and she is free to do anything but I ask her to come home and at least spend the night with me as there´s no need to get a hotel - especially with our upcoming babymoon. She gets incredibly upset at this and says that nothing will satisfy her except for the hotel and night away.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today (Saturday) and I thought this had blown over. I stick to my offer that I made her previously and start the day off by taking all responsibility around the house and caring for our child while she sleeps, I also make her breakfast. She however blows up at me after all this and says ""No this is not a break. I need a night away in a hotel."" An argument ensues and I end up feeling hurt that she doesn´t appreciate my gesture of giving her the weekend off all responsibility. In the end she storms out and books a hotel for herself anyways and stops talking to me.

I have a rare opportunity to do a degree apprenticeship (it's basically working while doing a bachelor's degree paid for by your employer and getting paid for the work). It requires me to move 4 hours away from my parents into my own place.

I currently live at home with my parents and pay for about 50% of the rent and other household expenses. My parents both work minimum wage jobs and dont make enough to pay for the household without my contributions.

I started to apply for multiple apprenticeships about 6 months ago and told my parents in no uncertain terms that I will be moving out if I get accepted for a role which was far from home and that they will have to manage the costs on their own. At the time they are both very happy and agreed saying that they will manage. 2 weeks ago I got accepted for a role in a town 4 hours away from my house when I told them I am accepting the role they both came out a told me that I am not allowed to take it is too far from home and it would be too far for me to travel daily, for some reason they were thinking that I would travel from home to my new place of work daily even though I told them that I would be moving out.

When I moveout I will not be able to pay for my parent's expenses as I will have increased expenses of my own. Am I wrong for leaving my parents on their own even though I gave them 6 months notice that this might happen? I start my new role in 3 months so they still have plenty of time to find a smaller place they can afford on their own but they seem intent on trying to stop me from taking the role instead of finding getting an affordable place. I would be the first person in my family to have a degree and long term stability as the role is for a minimum of 4 years and comes with many benefits.

It took a while but I’m slowly coming to terms with my body, since gaining weight I’ve actually been happy in my body for the first time since I was 10 I had a healthy relationship with food.


My sister is constantly making remarks on my weight gain and sometimes it reduces me to tears, I’m a healthy weight - I know this, she knows this too.

Sometimes because of these comments I find myself falling back into old habits and it puts a strain on my relationship.

I’ve told my mother that I fully intend to cut my sister off, and this won’t be temporary, I have no intention of telling her why either (she grew up with me, she knows how I feel about my body, she’s seen my reactions to her comments) 

My mother thinks I’m TA because I should understand this is my sisters way of coping with her weight and while I can limit communication, cutting her off is OTT 

Wife agreed and says I’ve had support and sister should too

1,"WIBTA for calling cops on young kids not in school | This has been on my mind all week.  Earlier this week, I pulled into a grocery store parking lot at around noon (weekday).  As I was waiting to pull into a spot, the car in front of me stopped and 2 young boys (maybe 11-13 years old) got out.  The car pulled away and left the shopping center. I wondered why the man had left these young boys.  My first thought was why weren’t the boys in school.  I went into shop and when I came out the boys were selling chocolate.  
 
I’ve thought of those boys all week.  It really bothered me that the man just left them out there alone.  Why weren’t they in school?  Why were they left alone at that age?

0,"AITA for not supporting my parents decision to adopt a child | I don't have a great relationship with my parents, but it's... okay. We talk to each other on holidays and birthdays. I had my first child a little over a year ago; their first grandchild. I thought this would bring us closer, since I hear grandparents like to spoil their grandkids. My MIL does this well. But, a few months after my daughter's birth, my mom (61f) texts me and says she is moving to the Philippines to adopt a baby. Reasoning: She's always wanted to adopt a baby. This is true. I remember my parents trying to adopt here in US (about 20 years ago), but they were deemed unqualified. Anyways, I thought she was joking, but 2 weeks later, my mom was on a flight to the Philippines. 

My mother buys a condo in PI and begins fostering a baby girl (we'll call her Emily) who's a few months younger than my own. My father is supportive of the idea. He is living here in the US and sends money to my mom for financial support. My younger sister is also supportive of the adoption. I am not. I had an abusive childhood, but according to my younger sister, their attitudes have changed since the time they raised me.

Fast forwarding to now: my parents were denied adoption rights because they are too old, but my mom is still caring for Emily until she's placed into new guardianship, which my mom estimates another year or so. 

Today, my dad called me and said ""Hey, I didn't get any gifts for \[your daughter\], but you'll get bonus points if you send Emily some money for Christmas. $100 will go a long way."" I told him I don't plan on sending any money right now, nor do I care for his bonus points. 

I know it's the time of giving, but I was a bit heated when he said he wasn't going to be giving a gift to his grandchild and then asking for money. Now, I feel guilt and jealousy. I want Emily to have a wonderful life and my parents (maybe) want a do-over when it comes to parenting, but I also want my daughter to get more love from her grandparents. AITA?

**Tldr:** I didn't have a great childhood. Gave my parents their first grandchild hoping this bundle of joy will bring us closer, but they aren't acting how I was hoping they'd react. They try to adopt a child (same age as my daughter). I don't support this adoption. Part of me feels jealous and angry that my daughter isn't getting the love she deserves, the other part says I should support someone trying to adopt. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,3,Care
0,"AITA for completely cutting off communication with someone who told me they have autism? | Recently got back into the dating scene and to help start off, I went back on Tinder just to get a heads start.

About a month or 3 weeks ago, I match with a guy who lives pretty close and we pretty much hit it off, text on the app for a little bit and we chose to exchange numbers.

Fast forward to about next week, he text me asking if we can hang out and I inform him that I can't, I would be running errands for my mom because she had a couple of medical appointments to do throughout the evening. He then ask if we can just talk in person while we do those errands, for which I inform him it was kind of out of the blue and I still had to finish the errands. He replies with an excuse is an excuse but I just let it go.

Yesterday, he texts me again asking if we can get breakfast. I felt it was kind of out of the ordinary, seeing we haven't even met yet, nothing was planned and it was 5:30 am and told him maybe but I can't promise anything, seeing I was tired from the night before for work reasons and got home late but still had to run errands. He then says maybe we can have breakfast in his car, implying we pick it up and since he had my address anyway, it wouldn't be a hassle (planned another meetup a couple days before but had to cancel to babysit), as he is driving to my house. Wasn't able to shower or change, due to him being literally a couple minutes away, so, I caved in and said yes, not in the mood for a possible freakout in front of my apartment building. He also chooses to tell me in the car that he was autistic, me saying that I didn't mind and we continue our drive.

He chooses a diner close by, we eat and before being able to say I'm ready to go home, he blatantly states that since he was autistic, girls chose to skip him. Choosing to continue, I ask why and he says that due to people who have different thinking to him, him being observant was seen as being rude and impolite. Basically, from what he told me, when he matches with someone, to start off an ice breaker he would tell the girls his pros and cons of what he sees and what should be different next time and said that he didn't want to tell me because he felt it should've been obvious already of how I take care of myself, while I reply I wasn't able to change since he literally came to my house without warning me first. Aside from that statement, he adds that because he's autistic, he doesn't believe whatever he says isn't allowed but at least people should understand he says it because he's observant and it should help people be more aware of themselves.

After getting home, I tell him I can't continue contact, him stating that I just don't understand his way of thinking and drop all communication with him.

To be clear, I have no issue with anyone with disabilities or mental illnesses, for I have a couple of my own but I felt he just used it as an excuse to judge people and their appearances.

0,"AITA for hoping siblings will help care for our dying mom | This is a throwaway account.

My mom is 80 and I have been caring for her for 20 yrs. She does not get enough social security to afford living on her own and I made the decision to be with her. I accept responsibility for that. She has begged me not to put her in a facility and I have honored that.

I am the youngest of 5 and my siblings are a lot older than me. There is a lot of history here, but I have to keep it short. I will gladly answer any requests for more info.

3 of my siblings do very well financially and the other one gets by OK. 2 of them live close by and the other 2 live in another state. None of them have helped out with my mom over the years and I accepted that. I have been a single mom for 24 yrs and things have been tough at times.

My mom has been very ill in the past. I have worked 2 jobs and my adult son moved back home to help. My siblings who live close by did not help with getting her to dr appts, caring for her at home, or any financials. Despite this, they want to remain in contact, be kept informed of my mom's status, and have a say in her affairs.

My son, who was working and going to college full time, quit school to help. I did not ask him to do this and it kills me that he did. When my mom got better, my son landed a better job, saved up money, and prepared to move out again.

My mom then became severely ill with diabetes and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. My son stayed home, I left my job and withdrew my retirement money so I could stay home to provide the 24 hr care my mom needs. My retirement money has since run out and now the burden is falling completely on my son.

My siblings think I should be home caring for our mom and they said they would help, but since having this discussion they claim they do not have extra money or time. I’ve been happy that they are successful and can afford many luxuries. I told them that I don't think anyone is obligated to provide assistance, but I would like for them to make their intentions clear so there are no false expectations or angry reactions to decisions I may have to make (e.g. one of my siblings was unhappy with potential funeral plans due to my financial constraints). I have to get a job and cannot leave my mom alone. She probably does not have long to live so we’re not talking about a situation that will drag on for years. I can try to work overnights while my son is home, but I don't know when I will get any sleep due to so many dr appts. My siblings have the resources to help, but they are not doing so. Yet they cry on the phone when discussing her impending death.

0,"AITA for hating when people drop by my house without an invitation? | For context, this just happened over Christmas - I live alone with a dog and two cats, a short walk from my parent's house.  My parent's house is very large, so they were hosting Christmas for our extended family.  I agreed to help my parents out by spending Christmas Eve and Christmas Day cooking sides and desserts for both dinners and then showing up with food to join the family later in the day. 

On Christmas morning, I am running around in my kitchen in some pajamas, trying to cook several things at once, and I hear a knock on my door.  It's some extended family, including my baby cousin (a toddler.)  I was pretty taken aback, as I was a) not in a state to receive guests and b) in the middle of several things.  

They came in when I opened the door, and immediately several of them were launching questions at me at once.  The kid wanted to see the pets (who ran and hid) and what was I making and where is some furniture they recalled from last time and how is everything going and what am I watching and where did I get these recipes and when are we even eating again anyway?!  I was doing some concentration-heavy tasks at the time (trying a complex baking recipe for the first time,) so I was trying to keep up with the timing of that while also trying to answer their questions.  I got very flustered.  

Eventually I tried hinting they should leave by saying things like 'I wasn't expecting company,' and 'I wish I had known you were coming,' 'I'm sorry, I really have to concentrate on this' and 'my pets are hiding, they get really stressed out by kids and loud voices,' and 'Oh, just a heads up, I need to hop in the shower soon.' (All of which was true.)

Eventually my family got very snippy with me, such as snapping at me ""well go and take a shower then!"" and ""Well OUR cats don't hide from baby cousin!"" but fortunately they finally left. 

Later I brought it up with my mom, and she implied that I was the weird one for being uncomfortable with unannounced visitors.  My family's frustrated reactions also seem to indicate this.  Personally, I think it's rude to show up unannounced/uninvited anywhere, and would never consider doing that to someone else; so I was pretty taken aback when it happened to me, and maybe didn't handle it well?

0,"AITA for telling people that I'm an orphan? | I'm female and young enough that people reasonably assume my parents are alive. They are not. For personal reasons I've cut the rest of my family off too, so I've been totally on my own since I was 19. Recently, I've started to wonder if letting people I'm not close with know this about me is some sort of huge social faux pas.

This mostly becomes an issue around the holidays where you're bombarded with smalltalk about what you'll be doing over break. ""Are you going back to your parents' house?"" is a common one -- if it's someone I don't really have any sort of relationship with at all I'll just answer something like ""nah, I'm just meeting up with friends"", but when I get these questions from people like classmates or colleagues on my immediately team at work I see every day I might try to gently say ""I'm on my own"" or ""no, I don't have much family"" or something like that.

My family history isn't super traumatizing for me to think about or anything, but I don't exactly enjoy having to field questions about my non-existent family either. So I'd like to let people I interact with frequently know this stuff so they at least know to avoid the topic with me. But they pretty much always react like I took a massive shit in the middle of the room whenever I say it.

One recent incident I've been dwelling on is this time I was talking to one of my supervisors (50s M), and he was offering me some advice about health care. He asked me something like ""are you still young enough to be on your parents' insurance"" -- I thought it was relevant so I said no, that's not an option for me since my parents are gone. He immediately got stopped up and acted like I'd said something inappropriate (he didn't chastise me, but it definitely felt like he thought I shouldn't have said it).

I really don't feel like I'm dropping nukes here with the way I phrase it (I try to keep it neither too heavy nor too flippant -- though I've TRIED saying it with a little sense of humor about it and that always went basically the same), but I've had enough of these hyper awkward interactions that it occurs to me I have no idea what the average person without a grimdark backstory considers appropriate social protocol here. I can get some degree of awkward response, but often it's clearly less of a ""oh, I feel bad for you and that makes me feel awkward"" reaction so much as it comes off like ""there's something wrong with you for sharing this information"".

I feel like on top of the weird factor, it has too much potential to make Doug feel like his autism is defining him.

I will also say that 9 times out of 10 these employees are friends of his.  There's a few times where it has been a surprise where he just walks in with one of the guys which leaves me running around the kitchen trying to figure out how to adjust dinner to accommodate and extra mouth to feed.

Now, I am more than happy to give them room and board for a few days on those one off's.  I get it, business is tough and whats good for the goose is good for the gander.  When business has been rough before there was a time when we had a different worker living at our house free of charge for up to two months.  This went on for about two years.  I felt like I was being taken advantage of.  After I had about enough of that we compromised with a one week maximum.

Wednesday I received a text from my SO as I am driving home from work stating ""Just FYI, Michael is at our house right now.""  I had no problems with that, workers come over all the time to pickup parts.  Nope, it turns out that Michael was staying with us Wednesday night and Thursday night.  My first thought was, ""Why in the hell now that family left does he need to stay with us?""  Apparently he had been sleeping on the other coworkers' couch and it just wasn't ""ideal"" for him.  I was irritated but the week went okay he was one of his friends so it wasn't too terrible of a time.

1,"AITA for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto FB who died during the 9/11 attacks? | I lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when TWC towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. 

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.""

A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here?

We just moved to the US this year and it is my son’s first year in school here, all of our first Halloween celebrations. 

My son is in third grade and has been excited to celebrate Halloween. I bought him a costume and we decorated the house and drew on pumpkins, I thought that was enough for him to feel he’d participated. 

I didn’t realize trick or treating was so widespread and thought he’d realize it was a tradition for some families but not ours since we don’t eat much candy, it is raining here, it is a school night, etc. 

Plus I am not very keen on his approaching the neighbors we haven’t met and running around the neighborhood after dark, even if I am with him. 

I told him tonight was not a good night but I’d go to the store and he could pick any candy he wanted. He is *hysterical*. I have not seen him this upset in a long time. 

He went to school and discussed this with his friends and five different moms called and offered to take him out. 

I didn’t want him eating a lot of candy and being exhausted tomorrow so just said “thanks but no thanks” and they were all very surprised and several asked “oh no is he sick” or “did he get into trouble” as though it was unthinkable he wouldn’t go out for this tradition. 

He says all his friends are going out but I cannot tell if it’s the same as “all my friends have the new Nintendo” or “all my friends stay awake until midnight” etc.

1. I happened to mention that me and my roommates had needed to go to a food bank this month because we had some unexpected expenses and were left a little short.  His reaction was ""I'm worried about your ability to financially take care of yourself, it sounds like I need to take control of your finances to make sure you're being safe"" 

2. I had a flare up of an existing mental health issue. I told him I may have to go to the hospital. Instead of responding with support I was told ""oh you just need a pacifier. The pharmacy can give you an emergency dose of Ativan you'll be fine"".

0,"AITA for cutting off my father for not paying for my college tuition? | 18 y/o high school senior here. My mom's been abused basically her entire life, including by my dad, and when I was seven my dad started to threaten her with death if she didn't divorce him and move back to the US. He took all of our money so she didn't finish the divorce entirely as we had to flee to live with her parents before we were totally broke. My dad accused her of kidnapping (even though he knew we were leaving), dragged her through US federal and circuit courts, and she was acquitted and got custody. However, he also received mandatory visitation, mandatory phone calls/contact, had to pay no alimony or settlements, and only pays minimal child support ($300/month).

As I've grown up, he and his family have continually denied that any of the abuse happened. His entire extended family insists my mom poisoned me and lied to me even though I witnessed and remember this abuse. However, aside from this, they do try to be good family, paying for flights to visit them, buying me clothes, etc, but their denial of these events really bothers me. Besides, even with a generous estimate of how much they pay (including child support) the amount they contribute still doesn't really cover the cost of raising a child, which my mom's parents have pretty much covered while my mom has been trying to recover from her trauma and find a stable job. My dad and his new wife on the other hand are very well-off, spending a lot of money on private school and expensive clothes for his other kids.

Now, I got into my dream school, and my dad is insisting that if he pays for my college (asking for $15,000 for the first year, even less after that if I become an RA and get the scholarships I applied for), I have to visit with him and his family more and start to distance myself from my mother, which is a non-negotiable for me. My mother is everything to me. He won't acknowledge any of the abuse he perpetrated against her for the eight years they were together, calling both me and her a liar. He keeps criticizing my mom and her parents for not being able to pay more for my college education, and calls my mother a ""lazy"" woman who is the ""source of all of my anxiety"" and has poisoned me.

0,"AITA for not wanting to know my bio-dad and family? | I'm the result of a one night stand and my dad was never a presence in my life. My mom remarried and that man became my father. They had kids together and we were a big, blended family. Two years ago I got engaged. Around that time my bio-dad got back in contact. He apologized, explained why he was gone. I understood his reasons. He was a drunk, on drugs, living on couches then. He wasn't ready or in a position to be a father and I believe him when he said he was too far gone to get right for me. Leaving was the best thing he could have done because it opened the door for me to have a stable life. We'll call Bio-Dad: Mike.

I let Mike in on a low-contact basis. We'd meet for lunch or dinner once a month. I didn't want to meet his family, wife and daughters, which I guess makes them my half-sisters. I didn't tell him I was engaged but I forgot to take my ring off so he found out. Somehow he got the idea he'd walk me down the aisle. I told him my (step) dad would be doing it. Mike got upset and started offering ""alternatives"". Maybe he could walk me halfway, or both him and my stepdad could take an arm. Then he suggested I make everyone happy and have my grandpa walk me. I told him I was uncomfortable with his emotions and needed a break. I cut him off. For six months he stayed gone but then he started sending me letters about himself, photos of his life, his family and whatnot. 

One day about three months ago he brought his 13 and 16 year old daughters to my place of work to meet me. I asked them all to leave and went to my manager's office until they left. More recently he showed up at my house with the daughters, his wife, and his parents. I asked them to leave and told Mike that I wasn't interested in knowing him. I didn't want him or his family in my life. He insisted I should at least try to know ""my sisters"". I told him I wasn't interested. I had a family, siblings, grandparents, and his family was not part of it. I told him to fuck off. He asked me about my wedding. I scoffed and asked if he seriously still thought he was invited. He asked me about walking me down the aisle. He was crying. I told him I wished he had never contacted me and that he should just leave me alone. He left but he couldn't stop contacting me so I got a restraining order against him.

Some of my friends have been in the know and I've been honest with them. They told me I took it too far with the legal blocking and I should try empathy. He gave me up so I could have a better life but it didn't mean he didn't love me. Apparently because he made a hard choice he has a right to know me now that he's turned it around. I know he doesn't have a ""right"" to me but do I have some kind of moral and emotional obligation to honor his sacrifice of me by letting him in? My friends said it was a dick move for cutting him off and going off on him

1,"AITA for telling my son the reason we don't get along? | So, ex and I had our children young (our eldest was born when we were 17 and youngest was born when we were 19) we broke up when our youngest was 2months old.

I had our children one week of the month.

When our son was a baby he would never settle for me, he would always ask for his mother, he would just never settle with me.

It got worse as he got older, he would just never listen to me and sometimes he would cry for his mother so much that he would just throw up everywhere.

He went to therapy but it never really improved, when he was 7 I got offered a good paying job about 11 hours away so I moved, my daughter would visit every second weekend and all school holidays but our son would refuse to see me and we didn't want to force him, I'd skype him every night.

He's 17 now and asked me why we never really got along when I made an effort with my other children (his sister and my children I had with my partner)

I told him the truth, no matter how petty it makes me seem, he only wanted his mother and I didn't have the patience.

He's obviously upset and I regret basically cutting him off, i should've forced him to come visit and tried harder but my wife thinks I should have lied and because I told him his mother coddled him that makes me seem like an AH for bad mouthing her.

0,"AITA for talking about my dead husband during my AA speaker meetings due to the fact that it makes my current husband uncomfortable? BONUS: AITA for keeping one picture up of him in my house? | Bit of backstory here: my second husband and I got sober together on literally the same day. As of 2019, I have 20 years of continuous sobriety, even though Mike died of heart failure 17 years ago. During this time, I married my current husband Brian 13 years ago. I am actively involved in a 12 Step program, attend meetings regularly, and speak on my anneversary. As Brian is a ""normie,"" i.e., not alcoholic or anything, he doesn't go to any of my weekly meetings.

He has not gone to one of my speaker meetings in many years. 

However, this year I FINALLY found out why. Apparently, it makes him feel uncomfortable when I talk about Mike's death, especially because I often get choked up at that point in the story. He never told me that before - he just made excuses to not go or bowed out because ""he's heard it all before."" (To be honest, the story doesn't change all that much over the years.)

After he finally got honest about this point, he made a snide remark about the one picture that I have up in the house of Mike. It is in our room, not prominently displayed, but it is there. I have thought about moving it to the spare bedroom, but I am not comfortable with just shuffling it off to an unused part of the house. I thought I was being respectful by not having it in the living room like it was before we started dating.

0,"AITA for calling a woman a cunt at the grocery store? | Some relevant background information: I have a myriad of health concerns, most of which are joint/back related. Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. 

Now onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.

Another woman in the isle pushes past me and says ""Fine just leave it then."", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say ""Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over."" and she scoffs and says ""don't make up fake excuses"" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said ""Don't be such a cunt"" and walked off to continue my shopping. 

When telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide.

0,"WIBTA If I don’t tell my brother I found his cat? | TL;DR at end
Background: I have dogs & cats. All of them have been rescued from being strays/abandoned, etc. I’ve also been fostering for 2 years. Obviously, I love animals. I’m 24 & moved out of my mom’s house 3 years ago when my boyfriend and I got a house together because I didn’t feel my pets and I were safe. Without going into detail, my mother has never been easy to live with but my last 7 years in her house were hell.
About 7 years ago (I was 17), I rescued a starving, sick kitten that I found in a parking lot across the street from a burning building. He was screaming, and alone, & starved. I took him home, fed & took him to the vet. I named him Scout. Because I had pets already, my younger brother decided Scout would be “his” cat. I didn’t mind because I was still living in the same house.
 A few months before moving out, I had worked a 17 hr shift and I got home asking about Scout because I had not seen him. NOBODY else noticed him missing. My boyfriend and I put up posters, walked the neighborhood for hours and put his litter box out. My brother did not help us look. The next night, boyfriend and I again searched all day. Around 11pm, we went out to check the litter box again and he had returned!! When I moved out, I took all the pets except Scout because my brother and mom wouldn’t let me. I begged them to be careful.
Well... not even a month after I moved out, I was told Scout was missing again. ONLY boyfriend and I again searched. We did everything we could to find scout. We kept it up for months but Scout never came home or was found. Over the last few years, I’ve continued to look for him and get email alerts for lost/found pets on my city. I check every one in case it’s him. I was devastated and have felt guilty about not bringing him with me.
Yesterday, while checking the animal shelter page, I saw a freshly posted cat I KNEW was him. By then, the shelter was closed. I showed my boyfriend, and he agrees it’s him. I texted my brother right away and sent him the picture. He said it looks like Scout. When I asked if he wanted to go see him at the shelter, he asked if today. I explained it was closed but he could go tomorrow AM since I can’t go till after work, around 5PM. All he replied with was “yea maybe”.
My boyfriend and I decided we will go after work, adopt scout, bring him home, & not to tell anyone. Would I be the asshole if I do this?
TL;DR: Cat that I rescued as a kitten 7 years ago was deemed my brother’s cat when we all lived together. He was let out to escape from mom & brother’s house a month after I moved out(3 years ago). Brother and mom wouldn’t let me take him with me when I moved. They never helped in extensive search for him.

I (F19) have been sort of going over in my head whether or not I should tell my mom about the fact that I like girls. She grew up in a very cult like setting where they were pretty much against anything and everything fun because someone did something in the Bible so don't do it or enjoy hell - they were not Christians, they were something way more fanatic so I'm not coming down on Christians. Anyway, she's said several times in the past that she would wonder where she went wrong or feel like a failure of a parent if I ""turned out gay."" But I knew this wasn't really her talking, but more of that cult talking so I never hated her for saying it.

Anyway, finally decided one afternoon to tell her that a recent outing with a ""friend"" off Bumble was more than that. I teared up, and became a lot more vulnerable than I usually am. I mean, it's a pretty scary situation. I thought she was going to look at me different. But she keeps texting on her phone and says, ""That's fine."" She was a bit more nonchalant about how upset I was than I cared for, but later she said she was trying not to make me nervous by looking at me the whole time so whatever. 

Anyway, something we like to do is go in each other's social media accounts and post something to throw off our friends. So while she was napping, I came up, unlocked her phone, and was about to go on her Facebook when I decided to check out audio recordings. Sometimes, she'll record us when we're reading a bad book or a bad movie to catch all the jokes we make and how much we laugh. So I click it thinking it's one of those until I skip ahead and hear myself crying and coming out to her not one week ago. I immediately wake her up and ask her why she did this.

I ask her to delete it. Telling her I was unusually vulnerable than I've ever been.

I feel like I am just being scrutinized over every little thing now. I almost dread coming home from work sometimes because I wonder what she is going to say.

Breastfeeding isn’t going well, sleep schedules are completely fucked, my body is a seeping sack of sutures and stitches, and I’m honestly feeling like a broken person at the moment. 

Mentally I’m doing great, however it’s the physical part that I’m struggling immensely with.

My husband and my 13 year old stepson have a weekend tradition of ordering pizza, blasting UK garage which is... loud and bright to say the least, and playing fifa with the volume turned way up. 

I gave my hub the go ahead to carry on these weekend traditions because time with his son is important, and I thought it would be fine. Sadly however, the reality is that the noise levels are beyond ridiculous, they’re still the same as they were pre baby and I’ve explained to them both that even if baby is awake, sometimes I’m trying to get a 10 min power nap and the dulcet sounds of fifa commentators aren’t really doing it for me.

My husband turns it down, but then my stepson turns it way back up because he forgets. I’m also incredibly ratty at the moment and emotional, so my temper is flaring. I asked my husband to supervise that the volume is on low, he’s a gem who has been incredibly brilliant and over and beyond supportive so I don’t want to take away his only bonding time with his son, but the reality is I need sleep, and I need to heal.

I suggested that the two boys go to play fifa at my MIL’s who is literally a 5 min drive away from us, and my husband apologised and understood. My MIL however rung me up and told me that it’s also my husbands and my stepsons home and that it’s unfair that I’m kicking them out.

They were so excited about christmas last year. There were many presents for them under the tree from the grand parents and us, and they were constantly checking them out trying to guess what was in them. 

They could hardly wait for Christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents early. So we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them. It was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when I told them they could open it on Christmas eve. They tore into it like a couple savages. I'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get at the goods. 

As the final paper was ripped off the present, the oldest was going like ""it's a..it's a"" and the final paper came off, ""brick"". I thought it was hilarious. The looks on their faces was priceless. Unfortunatly they were somewhat upset, tears were shed etc. So we let them open one more present to calm them down.

My sister is childfree and does not want kids. She has a cat whom she adores and basically treats as if it's her baby. That's fine, I don't care. However, she also has a niece (my daughter), and is no where NEAR as loving and affectionate to her as she is the cat.

To clarify, I'm not saying my sister is mean to her niece. She smiles at her, is friendly enough, speaks to her when spoken to, etc. But when I look at the way she treats her cat (fussing over it, buying it treats, calling it baby, kissing it on the head), in comparison it comes off like she loves a cat more than my daughter.

I called her out on this when I was visiting her this week. The cat came into the room and was rubbing up against our legs and such. My sister starts fussing and cooing and talking to the cat. I made a comment that she never talks to Sarah (niece) like that. My sister kind of laughed it off and made a joke that she doubts Sarah would want that. I got a little more serious and pretty much told her straight ""It seems like you love your cat more than your niece"".

My sister essentially agreed and said she loves her cat to death, but ""that doesn't mean I don't care about Sarah"". I told her maybe she should show it.

My sister is now mad at me, saying I'm making a drama out of nothing and trying to guilt her for loving her cat. Her boyfriend also called me pathetic, apparently.

0,"AITA for refusing to help my ""disabled"" boyfriend and calling him a bitch? | &#x200B;

Background: We (early 20s M+F) have been together for a year. We have an amazing relationship aside from this incident, he's brought up marriage, etc. 

&#x200B;

The dirty: My boyfriend broke his leg while horsing around with his friends on a boy's trip. He was discharged from the hospital and a surgery to repair the break was scheduled for a few days later. When he got home, he proceeded to *ignore* nearly all of his discharge instructions (elevate the leg, ice it, take painkillers, stay in bed) and insisted he felt fine. Of course, he was in a crazy amount of pain the next day and I had to leave work to take care of him. He's since had surgery and has continued being a terrible patient.

&#x200B;

He's fallen *three times* on his newly repaired leg, each time from doing something risky (going up stairs on crutches, trying to see how fast he can go on his mobility scooter, taking a shower alone), and each time he blames me. Yesterday, before he fell in the shower, I asked him if he wanted help. He told me no and shut the bathroom door in my face. A few minutes later, he called me down from upstairs. He was very irritated and told me he had fallen in the shower, and that I was a ""terrible caretaker"" and that it was my fault. I calmly reminded him that I offered to help him shower, and since he locked me out of the bathroom and refused my help, that there was no way that I could have prevented him from falling. He threw his crutches on the floor and ranted at me while he dried off and went upstairs. I was so frustrated that I cried.

&#x200B;

I haven't slept more than 4 hours at a time since his accident, since he wakes me up when he needs pain pills during the night. We've probably spent close to $500 on UberEats in less than two weeks since nothing that can be made at home is good enough for him. He requires lights to be turned on and off, blinds to be at just the right angle, gets cravings for strange foods at peculiar hours. I feel like I'm taking care of a pregnant woman with no support system and no maternity leave. Some nights, I don't even have time to shower. 

&#x200B;

After his shower tantrum, I told him that he was being a b\*tch, making life extremely overwhelming for me, and that I wasn't going to cater to all of his needs anymore. I told him that I was done catering to him and potentially done with the relationship if he didn't change his attitude. He seemed shaken and was upset that I went that far. He also took issue with me calling him a b\*tch and said that my approach was rude. I did apologize, but I also feel like I was justified in saying what I said. He disagrees. 

&#x200B;

I feel conflicted because he clearly trusts me and I understand that having a broken leg must be difficult for him, especially since he's a fiercely independent and physically active guy. I love him and am sympathetic to his situation, but I feel like his behavior is seriously out of line.

Turns out one of his friends from college love ""close"" to me and his dad just passed away. He asked if I would be able to make something for him and take it to his friends house. He said that he would Venmo me to cover ingredients for it and everything.

1. ""Close"" is a 45 minute drive (my brother does live halfway across the US away so closer than he is but still)
2. I am a relatively awkward person and would not like the social anxiety of showing up to the house of someone I never met, while they are mourning, with a tray of cookies and have to explain who I am and why I'm there. ""My brother said your dad died. Hope you like oatmeal raisin""

If I knew the person I absolutely would have done it but the inconvenience involved when it's for a stranger was just a little much.

But there is one account owner that has been particularly clingy, messaging me a lot initially and with growing frequency. His messages were a bit TMI at times but it was friendly enough. 

However, at some point he started to express feeling of attraction toward me very explicitly. I told him that I did not feel the same way and to please stop saying these things. He began messaging me many times daily on YT and instagram, saying he wanted to be in a relationship with me. I tried to continue to be polite but he seemed frankly obsessed. After a few more firm messages, I decided I had to block his account. 

Now he is messaging me from an alternate account saying he is very depressed and has thoughts of suicide. He says that if he hurts himself it's my fault. The whole thing has gotten very dark and is making me feel horrible about myself. I'm not sure what my duty is here.

I've been happily married to my wife for 3 years now. We get along great and we continuously work on our communication because, as all couples do, we've had minor issues in the early stages of our marriage. A part of this is we do our best to ask each other how our days were when we get home and actively listen to things that our going on in each others lives. I know this might sound elementary, but it means a lot to my wife and me being more of an introvert I dont typically think about asking how her day was.

So anyways, yesterday I had a group of friends over, which is rare on a weekday night. We were all watching the first NFL game of the year and my wife was getting home late from work that day so everybody was already hanging out in the living room, watching the game when she got home. She super sweet so she's immediatly saying hi to all the guys and asking if they need anything, etc. So after a bit she sits on the arm of my chair and starts to talk for about 45 minutes about random pointless stories about her day. So I start to get frustrated because I'm trying to not only enjoy the time with my friends but I'm also wanting to watch the game.

My friends dont seem to mind and in fact they actually engage in some of the stuff she's talking about. This is what makes me feel like my frustration here is possibly misplaced. I didnt tell her to go away or anything like that. I just kept listening and kind of showed disinterest through my one worded replies.

I'd also like to add that anytime she has her friends over I'll greet them and maybe engage in the conversations they're having just for a bit, but I make sure to let them have time to themselves.

0,"AITA for putting my friend out even though she has no where else to go | I invited a friend to stay with me after she lost her job then her apartment. She'd spent some time with two different cousins and was now facing living in her car. For context, this friend's situation is entirely of her own making. Her mother died a couple years ago and left her a sizeable chunk of money which she completely blew through in less than 18 months. She did get a job but had her depression classified as a disability and was constantly taking days off due to mental exhaustion (she worked remotely). The company fired her for taking a week of with the flu (perfectly valid) then taking mental health days when it was time for her to come back. She missed two very important deadlines so they were within their rights for fire her for cause. When I asked her to stay I was going through a tough time - I'd just been forced to put my cat (and best friend) down and had suffered a miscarriage. 

This arrangement was supposed to be for two weeks while she got word on a job she'd interviewed for. She made some incredibly tone deaf demands of the company (High salary, insane signing bonus, etc.) and they declined to make her an offer. This happened maybe 3 times before I explained to her that at her age (45) and with her spotty at best work record, no company in their right mind would give her what she wants.

And now it's been 3 months. I am an introvert with anxiety and depression issues. She did finally get a job, but she tends to spend all her money within 3 days of payday and provides no help financially. She doesn't clean or cook. And I need my time alone to recharge after working all day. But it's difficult when she's here if she's not working. I'm over all of this. I keep hesitating because if I put her out I'm basically forcing her to live in her car.

I've been at my job for about six months now, and I have a coworker who started a few weeks after me. Even though we've only been there a few months, since we started there she's lost 4 family members (an aunt, a cousin, two grandparents. Her cousin died a week ago). Understandably she's been quite affected by it. She says she doesn't feel like she can take time off because there's too much work to split between the rest of us, which I agree with - we wouldn't be able to cope. 

The result of that is that we have to put up with her morbid sense of humour. For example, she had some chocolate in the office fridge and I didn't know it was hers, so I asked whose it was and she said ""oh, that's my bereavement chocolate, it gets me through the day."" When I asked her about her weekend plans, she said ""probably a few funerals, a bit of mourning, maybe an impromptu phonecall to say someone else has kicked the bucket."" Another time, she was making everyone coffee (I admit she usually ends up being the one to do this as no-one else makes it as nicely) and she said something like ""of course, it should be you all making me coffee, seeing as I'm the one whose family are dropping like flies."" She said it in a jokey way but it made me uncomfortable. I get that she needs to talk about this stuff and is probably trying to do it in the least depressing way but death is death and I don't see why we should all hear about it all the time.

0,"AITA for telling my wife off for not taking my health seriously | Me [32M] and my wife [29F] have been together for five years. Recently the first major issue in our relationship came up and it has caused huge problems. In January of this year I started to get sick, I was nauseous, had a fever, I was laying on the couch under a blanket with the chills. I assumed it was some sort of flu. My wife on the other hand would encourage me to stay up and about, discouraged me from taking time off of work because we'd have less vacation time this summer, and very much down played how sick I felt. 

My 'flu' went away in about 4 days, and came back with a vengeance 4 weeks later and also caused back pain. Once again I was laid up and this time my wife had no patience for me, she would tell me to man up, say this is just a bad cold, tell me I was being ridiculous, etc. I made an appointment to see my doctor about it and she told me that was insane, that I just needed to take some advil and I'd be fine. She told me I had the 'man flu' and lectured me about how men who are barely sick exaggerate their symptoms because they don't know how to handle illness. Eventually after much convincing I cancelled my appointment. 

This cycle began a third time recently and I insisted on seeing my doctor. I think at this point she knew there was something going on too so she didn't object. After doing some tests my doctor told me I had a kidney infection that's been partially resolving on it's own and coming back. And he told me I should have come to see him months ago because waiting to see my doctor could have permanently damaged my kidneys. 

I am furious. I'm mad at myself for cancelling my last appointment, I'm mad at my wife for insisting nothing is wrong and convincing me to cancel my last appointment. I'm just pissed. Now we are stuck in the house together and I'm sleeping in the basement because we have a spare bedroom down here and I honestly don't want to deal with the drama of this situation while I am recovering for a third time from a kidney infection.

So a few months ago, my boyfriend’s sister passed away suddenly. We hadn’t been dating long but I was in the ICU with him when he and his family found out  (I asked multiple times if it were okay because I wasn’t immediate family and never met her but they insisted). He also wanted me there at the wake and funeral. I’m still pretty young (23, he’s 29) and it was the first time I’d ever seen or known of anyone passing away. 

Ever since it happened, I feel like I’ve been experiencing his grief secondhand but I feel like it’d be selfish of me to bring it up. At the same time, I don’t think I can keep hiding how much this experience has drained me emotionally.

Anyways... so my dad raised us from then on. My dad has been very supportive, caring and has always looked out for me and my brother, and both came up pretty nice, we're decent fellas I'd like to think.

My mom and dad are hardly ever in the same room, but my brother had his first kid 2 months ago so they've been together lately. I'm a 25 year old guy who loves to hug his dad and to be annoying to him. It may be weird for some people but I don't care, whenever we're standing talking to someone I sometimes come out of nowhere and hug him from behind and stuff like that. So, since my brother has had his first kid my mom and dad have been in the same room many times lately, and I've kept hugging my dad out of nowhere.

My mom gets pretty jealous and snaps her fingers to grab my attention and start demanding affection from me. I'm not a very affective person, I just show affection to my dad and my SO, otherwise 0 affection.

I see my mom ocasionally, once a month perhaps but I do not feel close to her, and I don't feel like showing any affection, but sometimes I feel bad for her, seeing her son hugging his dad but not wanting to hug her, but yet again, she kicked us out of the house...

So I said “You’re not in trouble and it’s good you wanted to do something nice for your sister, but we didn’t pay for this. That’s called stealing and it’s not nice to do. Think about if a friend took something from you without asking. You’d be sad, right? Stealing makes people sad and it’s against the rules.

He's struggled with alcohol and drug addiction (mainly weed, but every now and then goes on meth binges) for years which got worse after my dad died in 2010. About two months before our mom died, he decided to come home and stay with her. He was staying with her rent free though and continued regularly asking her for money. She would give him a little bit here or there, but not a ton.

I (31F) looooove children. I’ve always loved children. I’ve always wanted children. I was very vocal about this even as a teenager. I had names picked out for my future children by the time I was 15. If I sound like I was insufferable, I can assure you I was. In my defense, I grew up Mormon and that’s just part of the culture. I have since left the church.

I married my high school boyfriend and we are still very happy together. We waited to start trying to have children until we were financially stable, which was about five years ago.

It turns out I am infertile. I’ve had six miscarriages. Many tests have been performed and we still don’t know why this is happening. I don’t even want to get into how devastating this has been.

My issue is that people who I haven’t seen recently almost immediately bring up “so where are all those kids you wanted so badly?” Or (upon finding out I work with kids) “don’t you still want kids of your own?” Variations on this theme, you get the idea.

Part of me thinks I made my bed as a teenager and now I’m having to lie in it, but another part of me is like...if someone told me they wanted kids more than anything at one point and now doesn’t have any, I’d assume something went wrong and wouldn’t ask?

Normally I try to change the topic because I don’t like confrontation, but if pressed I just straight up go “yeah, I’ve had six miscarriages so...” obviously this makes people really uncomfortable. My answers get progressively more rude and sarcastic if they continue with “what about adoption” and “my friend thought she was infertile until she tried *insert holistic bs* and then blah blah blah” until they get the hint and stop.

That isn't the problem - I understand that that's her personality and she can't change it - especially when she's been alone for around 6 months (my sister had opted to stay in her residence and my dad works in another country). 

The problem is that yesterday, I hung out with her in her room and she took that as an invitation I guess to come to my room at around 3 AM (I was asleep but she was up praying) and climb into bed with me and sleep right beside me. I noticed but I kind of let it slide because I didn't want to be mean. Today, she went into my bed and fell asleep before I even went to sleep.

I'm also only 4'11, and weighed around 95lbs for half of my pregnancy, so it was also very hard on my body. Pregnancy was not really an enjoyable experience for me for a bunch of reasons, so I was determined to try and make the birth as smooth as possible. I started my birth plan at around 7 months, and was adamant I wanted an epidural. 

I moved back in with my mom when I was 6 months gone because of the health issues around my pregnancy, as my boyfriend works 8-5 and I was on bed rest for a long time. My mom helped with my birth plan, and continuously said that I shouldn't have an epidural, that I should experience birth, if I don't have a natural birth with anything but gas and air that I'm not a 'real' mother, that young girls always cop out, etc. She was also judging me for my parenting choices (such as wanting cloth diapers and wanting to try EC). I was sick of hearing it and told her that I would be doing what I wanted, and that if she was so insistent I couldn't have an epidural then she couldn't be in the room when I gave birth.

I had to have an emergency c-section. It was traumatic and painful, and I don't remember much of my daughter's birth. I'm having a really hard time coming to terms with this, and I really do feel like the universe is telling me I shouldn't be a mother because of the pregnancy issues and the birth.

I stuck to my word and my mother wasn't allowed in the room with me until the day after the birth. She came in upset, and when she held my daughter the first thing she said was 'ah, she's gorgeous.

0,"AITA for refusing to go to my stepcousins wedding in Hawaii because of my band and chorus concerts? | Hi guys, this is going to be a doozy, English isn't my first language but I'll try my best to be clear. 

So, my stepmom's niece is getting married in Hawaii this May. The issue is, the dates of the trip are over my chorus and band concert, with the actual wedding being on the date of my band concert. Also, we'd be getting back the day before I have to take my SAT's. 

Now, normally, the choice should be to go to Hawaii. But I told my family I can't go, because of these reasons. Her family and I don't get along, except for a few exceptions, they are all super judgemental and rude to me. Especially the bride and her mother (my stepmom's sister.) But it's Hawaii, right? I really hate beaches and hot climates, and don't get me wrong, I'm so thankful for the opportunity but it's genuinely someplace I wouldn't be happy in at all. 

Next, the real issue. I am very depressed, and what gets me through is my music. Missing these concerts means I couldn't be in any of my small ensembles for the rest of the school year. And this is what kills me. I'm lead chair in all of my band ensembles, and the lead soprano in my choir ensembles. It's something I work so hard for, and I can't stress this enough, at this current point in my life, I NEED these. Without them, I have absolutely nothing to look forward to throughout the week. It would absolutely KILL me to be without these. Music is my passion, my plan for the future, and if I couldn't be with them my depression would get so much worse. 

I just got into an argument with my dad and he called me selfish. I tried explaining everything to him (besides the fact I don't like her family) and he just brushed it off and made my emotions feel like they're stupid. He does this any time I bring up my depression, because he thinks mental diseases are stupid and fake. It really hurts because I can't get treatment, and my emotions get invalidated on top of that. 

The kicker, my stepmom said my dad didn't want to go. So I asked him why, and he said ""money."" So I told him ""My one happiness is less important than money. Who's the real selfish one?"" And left. 

I feel really bad right now. Please tell me if I am an asshole or not.",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,3,Care
0,"AITA for 'airing dirty laundry' on Facebook? | I had an interesting childhood but for the sake of brevity: parents had an ugly divorce when I was under 2 years old. Their marriage was both their second marriage and they both had daughters from their previous marriages. After the ugly divorce, my father chose to stay out of my life to avoid the drama with my mother and focused instead on raising his daughter from his previous marriage. We did not communicate or see each other until I was 10 years old. 

My mother went to live with her ex-husband after she divorced my dad. I don't believe that they were romantically involved but they lived together again when I was young. I remember living in my sister's dad's (we will call him John) house for years. He treated me like a second daughter. After they moved apart again, on weekends when my sister would leave to visit her dad, I went too. I had my own room in his house, went on family vacations, visited his family events, attended the wedding of his new wife, played with his new sons after they were born, etc. They always felt like an extension of my own family. I could call them at any time, day or night, and if I needed something, they would do their best to help. After I turned 14, John and his family moved out of state but we kept in touch over the years. I visited and stayed with his family when I was a teenager and whenever they visited our home state, we would meet up for dinner and catch-up. 

My father and I are now quite close after almost 20 years of slowly re-building our relationship while I am not in contact with my mother at all. 

John passed away today from cancer. It was tragic and sad. The diagnosis came suddenly and his death followed very shortly after. I was only able to say goodbye through an email and couldn't even speak to him.

After I heard the news, I ended up posting to Facebook about my grief that he had passed. My sister had done the same. I stated that it was a weird relationship that we had but I loved him all the same. I said that he raised me and was a prominent father figure early on in my life even though in our later years we weren't in contact as much. 

My mother's family started posting their condolences and how he stepped up to raise me, how he was a second dad to me, and how he was a great man to take me on as his own. 

All of these posts have now led to my father contacting me via text to take the post down. He stated that it was attention-seeking. That I was stealing my sister's grief and that the post was factually inaccurate. He called it 'airing dirty laundry' from the family and that it shouldn't be posted about to family and friends. 

Now I'm wondering if I had a right to even post about it at all and if I should just take it down. AITA?",False,False,4,3,3,2,1,3,Care

My friend has recently got very into alternative medicine, which is fine, however he's recently shared an image with her claiming Fibromyalgia can be cured with celery juice. About five minutes googling will reveal this idea comes from a man who believes ghosts told him celery juice can cure many ailments, it has no basis in science and zero evidence that isn't anecdotal.

My partner was a little upset by this, so I told him as much, and might of gone a bit far by saying the advice was ""unwelcome, condescending, and hurtful"" and referred to him as just some ""prick in a van"" giving unwanted advice (He lives in a van). He responded by saying it wasn't advice it was just ""universal knowledge"" he thought might help, so it would be wrong not to share it. I walked away at this point because I was getting angry and I didn't feel like it was worth falling out over.

A few days later he texts my partner to apologise, but followed his apology by saying ""I'm only trying to help, if that offends you maybe you should look at yourself and figure out why"" and then continued to encourage her to research celery juice.

I’m printing something for a project for my final and it’s 2 parts. The first part finished earlier that day and the second part is a 26 hour print. It had been printing for 8 hours by the time everyone was over. 

We are all standing around talking and she gets near the printer walking backwards. She’s been over numerous times and while the printer isn’t loud, it’s not exactly fucking quiet.

I was gonna say something but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt that she knew it was behind her.

Then she stepped on it. Now it’s not in an enclosure but it was printing on the front of the bed so she didn’t damage anything that I know of.

She apologized and I said it was cool. I checked the print and it was a little wonky, but figured it could have been like that. 30 minutes later they leave to run to the store, and I check the print better. It caused a significant shift in the layers, so the print is ruined. 

She wasn’t there anymore but I was complaining about how that was 8 hours and material wasted. I was upset, and I feel that’s a normal reaction to this. My roommate started telling me to chill out, which made me even more frustrated. He took the part of the counter and threw it away.

I grabbed it out of the trash can and started seeing if maybe I could still use it somehow. I decided to Atleast see how my diaroma will look with all the parts, so I start cleaning the supports off the failure.

I was upset when they came back over because that was 8 god damn hours wasted, but she was already embarrassed and I didn’t want to bring it up.

We didn’t have have the stablest home growing up, mom had 6 kids, she worked 3 jobs, and told us frequently how dumb fat and stupid we were. dad was always sending money back home to the motherland so we were left with hand me downs and a father who barely tolerated us. If anyone has parents from west Africa you’ll know about that level of strict assholery. Coupled with the fact they were a weird sect of Muslim it seemed like any joy was sucked from our childhood. Normal Muslims are cool but my mom and dad had won the lotto on weird.

Anyway because he lives with me and I usually do the grocery stuff I’ve started to buy more healthy shit like olive oil vs butter and eggs and turkey bacon etc. Nuts and seeds and no more weed cuz that gives him a free pass to eat like a m’fer.

My BFF (I'll call her Sam) has a clingy cat. When she goes out of town (even now) I sleep at her house so her cat won't freak out.

While still living with my parents (at 20), Sam asked if I could sleep at her house for a night the next week. I said yes. The issue is I forgot to write it down and forgot. Day of, Sam texted ""let me know when you get there"" which jogged my memory.

I dressed, told mom what was up, and tried to leave. She stopped me. ""Why haven't you mentioned it before tonight?"" I explained I hadn't written it down and just forgot. She seemed skeptical, but I left.

I ended up on the phone with a friend who was having a personal emergency around 1 AM. At 1:30 my mom called. I shot her a text saying ""On the phone, what's up?"" She didn't answer and kept calling. I sent the text again, and denied the calls.

Around 2:30 AM there was a knock on the door. Honestly, it scared the shit out of me. I ended the call and looked through the peep hole. I was shocked to see my mom.

I opened the door, and before I had the chance to ask her what was happening she shoved her way in. She said ""You're NEVER not on your phone! Who's here? Where is he?!"" I was caught off guard. ""I was on the other line... I sent you texts, didn't you get them?"" She pushed past me.  ""Oh, I got them. But I know they're a cover up. You're hiding a boy here, and I'm going to find him.""

She searched each room... She looked under beds, in closets, and in the bathtub... When she didn't find anything, she left. No apology, no other explanation, nothing.

I IMMEDIATELY called Sam to tell her what happened, and she made a great point. ""Even if you had a guy over, how is that her business?! You are an adult, and weren't in her house! Even if you had a boy over, it would be between YOU and ME, not YOU and HER!""

The next morning, my mom pulled me aside and told me she didn't want Sam to find out what happened, because it was embarrassing... I fibbed and told her I wouldn't mention it. I knew that if I told her that Sam already knew, it'd just spiral into another (worse) fight. I didn't want mom saying Sam wasn't welcome over anymore, or something. I asked Sam to pretend as though she didn't know, and she agreed.

My girlfriend (19) and I (23) have been dating for 4 months. She often stays at my place since we live 45 minutes away and she doesn't drive, so when I pick her up for dates it often gets late so we just crash at my place. Sometimes this results in her staying for a few days since I work. [*She says she would rather go on dates in her town and go home at the end of the night, but that I always make reservations at places close to me and then am too tired to drive her home and won't get up early enough before work to take her home, sometimes meaning she's at my place for days in a row unintentionally and gets stuck in my room the whole time since my roommate doesn't like visitors.*]

Today she called my place of work asking to speak to me saying my dog had just eaten a couple of her prescription medications and she had already called the vet and they said it was a lethal amount and the dog had to be brought in. She told me her mom was there and they'd drive her to the vet, but to meet them there. 

The vet ended up giving my dog medicine to vomit, except she wouldn't vomit there and waited until she was in my car (when me, girlfriend, and the dog were driving back to my place-- her mom went home) to unload everywhere. She is okay now. I asked my girlfriend what happened and she said that when her mom arrived (which I had no knowledge of and totally wouldn't have been okay with her having people over without me there) the dog would not stop barking and lunging for the door. My girlfriend has repeatedly said the dog isn't safe which just isn't true, so she locked the dog in our bedroom. Apparently while her mom was visiting, the dog chewed and destroyed all her things-- purse, clothing, bag of toiletries, etc.. [*While she accepts nothing bad has ever happened, she doesn't feel the dog is safe since she will lunge and growl and she doesn't feel strong enough to keep control over the dog. She thought putting her in a room was the safest way to handle things. Her mom was there to bring her medicine and food, since I don't keep food at my place and don't want her eating my roommates things. She also says I'm only mad about her mom visiting because I don't like her.*]

Not only did my girlfriend refuse to clean up the vomit, but she won't pay me back for the vet bill and is asking me to pay half toward replacing her items.

There wasn’t a particular restaurant either of us were dying to go to, so I left it to him to make reservations somewhere. He asked me to dress for fine dining. 

Now, through out the holidays my sister has been very sick in the hospital. She has been battling cancer and it’s metastasized into her brain. It entered into her brain fluid and essentially became something “incurable but treatable.” It has been absolutely **devastating** for our entire family. I’ve been not going to work as frequently and barely have it in me to be social with anyone. 

I spent Christmas Eve, Christmas, and basically almost every day in between in the hospital with her. I’ve started to feel bad and apologetic because I know my boyfriend wants to spend this time with me, but to me I need to prioritize my sister. 

Yesterday I found out my sister supposedly has “a few days to less than a few weeks to live.” I’ve never been more heartbroken in my entire life. I want to spend all my time with her, but I also don’t want to make my boyfriend feel unimportant or leave him in a situation where he has to be alone on holidays. You may ask why he can’t come to the hospital with me, but my sister specifically requested not to see any non-family members. 

The hospital has asked that my sister always has someone with her, so we arrange our schedules something like this: my parents stay with her for a long majority of the morning, some relatives/my other sister and I will come in through out the afternoon or when we are off work, and her husband comes at night to stay the night with her. 

Today, on New Year’s Eve, my family would like me to go around 5-6. My boyfriend made a reservation for us at 8:30. I wanted to try to do both, but the hospital is an almost an hour away from where we are supposed to be going. I don’t see how I can make it for the dinner.

0,"AITA for telling my brother to see a doctor. | I(33F) have 20 y.o brother. I’ve never really had a close relationship with him. Recently we started hanging out more. About a week ago I moved in with him temporarily. 

So, the thing is, he eats crazy amounts of food. I always knew that he liked food but not this much. For example: in the morning he’ll have cereal, few donuts(more than 2), and full chocolate bar, then for the snack he’ll eat 2 PARTY SIZE bags of chips. He’ll have full large domino’s pizza for lunch. Between lunch and dinner yesterday he ate m&ms, full jar, it’s called pantry size I think. He usually orders food for dinner too, yesterday he had 3 big mac meals. 

Most bizarre thing is he’s skinny as fuck.  Probably even underweight. So obviously there’s something wrong. I talked to him today and said that it was kinda weird, so I told him to see a doctor.

0,"WIBTA for having a celebration for being sterilised? | I am a 28yo female. I suffer from an anxiety disorder which is massively amplified by birth control - I get week long anxiety spirals pretty much every other week followed by periods of depression over the things I’ve just been anxious about that haven’t even happened. The only time in the last 8 years or so that I’ve felt okay was when I came off birth control a couple of years ago to see how I felt and I felt fantastic, however I got stressed at the thought of accidentally getting pregnant and went back on it and I am really struggling again. 

I don’t want kids - never have, never will - and my boyfriend of 10 years feels the same. Family often tell me I’ll “change my mind” but I see it the same way as people who know they want kids eventually - you just know. I have been saving up money to pay to get sterilised and I still need to finish saving and then start the whole process which will probably take a while but I’m really excited. It will stop me getting pregnant and I can come off birth control for the sake of my mental health. 

People who know about this have asked me if I’m sure, what if I change my mind, and told me what a big decision it is. I know it’s a big decision but I don’t think it’s any bigger than the decision to have a child and it’s something I’ve been thinking about for years. 

Some of my friends have been really supportive and know how badly I want this operation so they have asked if they can throw me a “non-baby shower” to celebrate when I have had it done. I really appreciate the thought but I’m conscious of the fact there are people in the world who desperately want kids but can’t have them and whilst I obviously can’t relate I don’t want to upset anyone by celebrating essentially making myself infertile when there are people who that is a big problem for.

She then brought up how I am always making hurtful jokes and it feels like I no longer like her. I thought she was overreacting and told her as much and told her again that it was just a joke and that she needed to calm down. This only made her more upset and now we aren't really talking.

1,"AITA for telling my husband he needs to box up his deceased wife’s stuff so we can move into their old bedroom? | I met my husband about 10 months ago at grief counseling. I was there because of a late term miscarriage and he was grieving his wife who had just passed away in a car wreck. (Sorry if this is too heavy for some people, by the way. We’re both doing super well now).

I was obviously very sympathetic to the situation and never expected us to become more than friends. But we ended up connecting and got married within months of knowing each other, which I don’t regret at all. I also now have a 6-year-old stepdaughter who’s been incredibly sweet to me, given the circumstances.  

When we first got engaged I sold my condo and moved into my husband’s house to live with him and my stepdaughter. It’s a gorgeous, spacious home and I love it. 

The problem is that my husband still is keeping the master bedroom exactly as it was when his wife was alive. All of her clothes, jewelry, makeup, etc. —just like it was the day she died. This is what my stepdaughter tells me. I’ve never actually been in the room because my husband generally keeps it locked and has made it somewhat obvious he doesn’t want me to go in there. 

So we currently sleep in one of the guest bedrooms. It’s comfortable enough but I’m starting to get tired of this situation. At first I was tolerant. I know our relationship moved quickly and everyone had to make some adjustments. But it’s now been almost a year and he’s still done nothing. 

I got so angry yesterday that I called the room a shrine (which he didn’t like at all) and said I might leave if he didn’t finally box up her things. I didn’t actually intend to follow through with that. I was just upset and hurt and wanted him to understand how important this is to me. 

Whenever I bring this up he rationalizes and says he’s keeping the room that way for his daughter. But I honestly think it’s for him. I’m sure my stepdaughter loved her mother very much but I don’t think she’ll be particularly traumatized if the house no longer looks exactly like it did before. Besides, she is only allowed in the room when he decides to unlock it for her, which isn’t all that often. 

He also said he doesn’t see what difference it makes to me because the guest room is basically a second master. But that really isn’t the point!

My wife just called me saying that her brother will be losing his housing in 10 days or less. He has a disorder similar to schizophrenia and bipolar where he hears voices talking to him telling him to do things, and he goes through swings where he goes from calm to shouting and cursing at people. He is living in an apartment community sponsored by a state program that helps people living with mental illness and recovering substance abuse issues. It's a public apartment complex, they just rent out a few of the units at a lower price to people in this program. 

We found out that he is being kicked out because he was yelling abusive language at families in a near by dog park while potentially on drugs.

My wife hasn't asked if he can live with us yet, but I am fairly certain that she will. I don't want him to live with us for 3 reasons: 

1. Only her and my name are on the lease. We're allowed short term guests but not long term guests/roommates, although it is kind of grey where that line is. 
2. He has been kicked out of his last 2 places because of being on drugs yelling at people. I like our home and our neighbors and I don't want to get a bad name in our neighborhood, or even potentially not being able to renew our lease, putting us in a difficult housing situation. 
3. Everywhere he's been stuff has gone ""missing"". TV's, phones, art supplies, you name it. It seems like anything we buy him lasts a month or two then goes ""missing"". Having experiencing a similar situation in my family I can't help but wonder if he is selling his possessions to buy drugs.

There’s constantly dog shit on our back deck that I have to tip toe around whenever I go in and out and she leaves pee puddles on the floor and then leaves. The puppy chases my cats so they’re stressed out and he can’t even be around anyone without biting them. He bit our friend in the face and drew blood. Anyways, I had enough and messaged her the other day to let her know I was going to start looking for other places to live because it wasn’t working out with the dog. I really wanted to stay in our apartment since it’s nice and I need the space so I asked her if she’d stay or go because if she was moving I’d like to stay. She didn’t respond. I gave it a day and asked again, and again she didn’t respond. Then finally she responded and said she’s staying. I said I’d look for places for March 1st (a month’s notice and March was already paid for). She then sent a screenshot of an email from our landlord saying all of my stuff needed to be out by March 1st. I asked her why she went to our landlord without telling me and there was no guarantee I’d have something for March 1st. She went off on me saying she’s looked past so much but she was done after what happened this week (literally just me saying I was moving out) and how she’s never had a friendship like this and didn’t want it. She proceeded to say she’s never been honest with me because she’d just make me cry (she’s an asshole and I’m sensitive) and that she was over it. I finished the conversation with saying I’d be out by the end of the weekend (moved back in with a parent) and told her to rehome her dog if she wasn’t going to take better care of him. I feel like that part was a bit harsh but it’s not wrong so I don’t feel allll bad about saying it. Then she literally blocked me on every form of social media so I can’t contact her. She’ll only talk to me through one of our mutual friends. The one thing I slightly feel bad about is that 90% of the furniture in the apartment is mine. We moved most of it out today and she’s left with a bookshelf and tv stand. There’s no couch, tables, lamps, etc. I feel bad that she didn’t have any time to get any of her own furniture but I also think she’s being immature to not be able to have a civil conversation with me. Also we’re on opposite schedules so we don’t see each other much at home which is why I haven’t spoken to her in person. 

TLDR: told roommate I wanted to move out because of her puppy, she said she was done w me and blocked me on everything, I moved out almost immediately and took all of my furniture leaving her with almost nothing.

When we moved out a year ago my son was sad that the dog that he loved for 3 years was no longer going to be with us. I promised him that I would get him a dog that could not be taken away from him within a year of moving. 

My son wanted a puppy and said he wanted a bigger dog than what we had before (my ex roommate had a yorkie poo). A couple of weeks before Christmas we saw a post from an animal shelter that they had been overrun with puppies. We went and chose a lab/unknown mix puppy and brought it home when it was 8 weeks old.

Has been given all shots and is on medication for flea prevention and heartworms. But she has a lot of energy and is hard to control at times, likes to jump up and at times will bark loudly and playfully try to bite your hands, feet.

Before Christmas my dad wanted to treat me, my girlfriend, and her (Asian) friend to a spa day, so we went with his girlfriend and her family.

Everybody laughed, including my girlfriends friend, but I could tell the joke made her uncomfortable. I called him dad out and said that he shouldn’t use an Asian accent mockingly like that but his girlfriend pointed out that my girlfriends friend was laughing and we moved on. My GFs friend later confirmed w me that she thought it was ignorant of him to use that accent. 

Skip to today, me and my dad went out for a lovely dinner and a movie and on the ride home I thought I would bring up with him his use of the Asian accent, expecting him to be receptive and understand how those words could be hurtful. Instead, he refused to apologize, said that he saw it as no different then using a French or Italian accent, and criticized me for always attacking and targeted old whites dudes as the cause of all the worlds problems. He said that he saw what I was doing as a dangerous path towards censorship and that if my GFs friend was offended she should’ve “grown a pair” and pulled him aside to let him know

I was so upset in the car that I cried and said fuck you, and I left without saying goodbye.

When she first sent me info on Young Living oils for my kids, I did some research and I decided not to buy because I didn’t like the structure of the company (it’s a network marketing company, for those of you who have not heard of Young Living), the founder of the company has an ugly history, and I also found some conflicting information on how safe it is to use oils around children, especially very young ones. Mine are both babies still and I didn’t want to take a risk. I didn’t say that to her, of course...I just said  it wasn’t in my budget (the oils are $$$$) and that I’d get back to her later if that changed. She was cool with it, didn’t push, no harm done. 

Anyway, over the past couple of months, both her kids (who had no particular health issues before this) have had seizures. Which is not unheard of in kids when they have fevers. But I do remember from my initial reading that seizures are a possible side effect in children of using certain essential oils. Something about their systems being more immature and less able to handle such concentrated substances. 

I thought about sending her the article I read on this subject on WebMD or otherwise bringing it up. But I am a little nervous to, because 1) it’s not certain or even likely that oils might have anything to do with it, 2) she is known as a mom guru and she  might resent being given advice by someone who is not an expert on oils and hasn’t even been parenting as long, and 3) she has ranted before about how people including other moms are always thrusting unsolicited advice on other moms and how mom-shaming causes harm, etc. 

I keep telling myself that it is so unlikely that oils have anything to do with her kids’ seizures so if I said something, i might be causing her anxiety or stress for no reason. Also, her husband is also a nurse so he would know so much more about this kind of thing than me, who has only read a few articles. I think I can safely assume that he would have said something himself if there were any real risk.

He was such a gentle, kind soul, but he had his personal problems. You know, being ""perfect"" always has its downsides. For every issue N felt like he couldn't fix in any aspect of his life, that made him sad. And beyond his social life with his girlfriend (me) and his friends, his family life was really troubled. His parent (mother) was absent when he was 2, and his older brother; a drug-addict, criminally convicted drop kick (opposite to N, who was a straight A student and a guy who cared for the feelings of those close to him), couldn't even maintain a job. He'd just end up let go after so long. N and their father helped N's older brother find work and would allow them to stay at their place when he'd eventually lose work. It was tough for all of them. N's dad is nice man and he's the one I truly feel for in this situation. I tried my best to reassure N with lots of affection and love, but it worked only for short moments.

It all wasn't enough for N though. 2nd of January early morning, I got a text from N's brother that N had been found dead in a car wreck into a ditch with a few friends. Apparently they were all drunk celebrating New Years and the driver and two other passengers died at the scene too. When I first heard of N's death... I was mad. Anger at N's friends who admitted to cops they pressured him into drinking that night, and anger at myself for not being with him prior to that morning. At the same time I felt sad, but no tears came out. I felt blank. I couldn't grieve properly for the love of my life. How pathetic is that? So my parents recommended I see a therapist for a few days which helped for naught. Waste of money to be honest.

And so, this memorial was held for him with tons of people who knew and loved N seated in a gymnasium at our old school start of Feb, and I was just so angry for N. I couldn't breathe. So when it was my time to speak, instead of the pre-written garbage I wrote, I simply said off my head: ""Why am I upset about N leaving? Because he didn't need to. It wasn't his fault.

She went to stay with my sister as I figured out what I was going to do. She stayed with her for a year or so. When she came back to me, she began having behavior problems. She felt more comfortable talking things out with my sister so I let her. 

This Wednesday the hospital called me and said that my daughter was in the ER. Some “friends” of my daughters had dropped her off, high, in my sisters front yard. She was unresponsive, so sister called an ambulance. My sister called me and filled me in. I didn’t even know that my daughter was using drugs. 

I talked with my sister as soon as I got to the hospital, and asked her what happened. She told me that she knew about my daughter experimenting with drugs, but she didn’t think that it was this serious. I’m taken aback by this, she knew that my daughter was using drugs but didn’t tell me. 

When I asked her why, she told me that she didn’t want to lose my daughters trust, and that she was handling the situation. Obviously not, if shes in the hospital. She apologized and told me that she didn’t think it was serious. I didn’t care. I have the right to know what is going on with my daughter. I am her mother, she is not. 
We ended up getting into an argument, and I told her that she had to leave.

I took my daughters cellphone and laptop, upon her returning home so that I could go through them. I noticed that my sister was trying to contact my daughter.

She called me a bad friend for not being there for her and she thought I hated cops as much as she did... I told her I have NEVER said I hate cops.

0,"AITA for “forcing” a gluten free diet on my family? | I have celiac disease, which means I can’t eat gluten. My family doesn’t have celiac so they still eat gluten. I do get frustrated with them sometimes, because they’re very careless and often leave crumbs everywhere or use my pots and pans (I have separate ones to avoid cross contamination). I’ve never asked them to stop eating gluten though. The only thing I ask is that they don’t use wheat flour, since it gets EVERYWHERE and can stay in the air for hours and hours after using it, which I can get sick from if I breathe it in (it has happened multiple times before). Of course they don’t really listen though.

Anyway, my dads birthday was the other day. He asked if I could make him a cake, so I did. But, of course, it was gluten free. I love my dad but I’m not going to make myself sick by baking with wheat flour, it’s not worth it. They can be kind of weird about gluten free stuff, acting like it’s poison or something. Sometimes if they know something is gluten free, they’ll instantly act like they don’t like it, or try it and say that it’s gross. Which is why I don’t really cook/bake for them anymore. My dad is the only one who doesn’t act like that, so that’s the only reason I even tried making a cake. 

Because of this, I didn’t tell my family the cake was gluten free. They all ate it and loved it, didn’t say anything about it being gross. Later that night my mom found the package for the gluten free flour in the garbage. She asked if I had used it for the cake and I said yes. She immediately told the rest of the family, and they’re all really mad at me for “forcing” my diet on them. They said they thought I had grown up by now, and wasn’t doing that anymore. I find this very irritating, especially since only my parents ate the cake! Obviously we can’t have a party right now, so this was just something for the three of us.

1,"AITA for asking my wife to shower when she smells like sour breast milk | My wife had our first baby in June. I had 2 weeks of leave and my wife gets 4 months. Our baby breastfeeds and my wife is doing a great job. It's an exhausting ordeal and I often acknowledge the hard work she is doing that I don't have to do.

Since she's getting ready to go back to work, and so I can help more with feeding, she has been building up a milk supply. When she is not nursing the baby she is pumping, and because of some mouth issues the baby has half of its milk given via bottle already.

One thing I wasn't prepared for was the smell of sour breastmilk. My wife doesn't have OCD, but she's always been the cleaner one of us, and I have been impressed that her habits haven't changed despite the baby. She takes care of our pets and still keeps the house clean (I help out inside the house too but it's always been ""her"" area). However, it seem like milk gets on everything. All over baby, all over my wife, all over towels and blankets, and of course there is the endless supply of bottles and parts that have to be sterilized. It's a lot to take care of but my wife has been amazing. She dotes on the baby and changes its clothes after every feeding, so usually the smell isn't strong on the baby. Unfortunately, that doesn't apply to my wife.

When I get home, the first thing I want to do is greet my wife and baby. It's the best part of my day, but when I go to hug/kiss my wife, the smell of soured milk literally makes me gag. It's extra bad when I just came in from outside and can smell it very strong. I try to be tactfully honest with her and explain I know it isn't from lack of hygiene. She'll change her clothes when I get home but it's still on her skin. It's become a real issue and I feel terrible because my wife is already upset about having to return to work and be away from baby, and she's exhausted from taking care of baby alone all day. She said I make her feel disgusting. When I ask her to take a shower, she cries and says she hasn't been able to because she's been holding the baby. She says when she hasn't had a minute of alone time all day, the first thing she wants to do when I take the baby from her is not always take a shower.

What's the solution here? Even though I am trying to convince her she doesn't disgust me, just the smell does, she says I am making her feel awful about something she can't help. I even suggested that we hire someone to come give her a break for even just a couple days a week so she could take care of herself, but she said that if I say that it means I don't think she is able to do it (also while crying). That is not true, but the smell does make me gag and as much as I try to suck it up, I can't control it. I can't believe that of all things in all the years we have been together, this is what's driving a wedge between us.

I point out he has 26 other days a month to “get to know them”. I think he shows off our son so they can see what a good dad he is.
He told me about the latest one, a week after he met her online. 37 (wow, the oldest by far besides me), just got fired from her job, lives at home sleeping on the couch, and has a 16 year old daughter. Literally that weekend and EVERY weekend since she’s been at his house, mostly leaving the daughter with grandma 45 minutes away. My son told me he does not like her, she sits on the couch on her phone all day, they don’t even leave the house, and he said she is using his dad because she doesn’t want to go home. My son told all of this to his dad who promised a “dudes only weekend!” Guess who he picked him up with and stayed the whole weekend?
Anyhow, my ex sees nothing wrong with going through women like toilet paper and said he would see it no differently if I did the same.

I was in my AP chem class when suddenly an entourage of people entered my classroom with a disabled girl (she has cerebral palsy) that I know. I first saw the posters and the bouquet of flowers she was holding and thought, ""aww that's sweet of her."" Then they revealed the posters and I read my name and was completely taken aback. I literally almost had a fucking anxiety attack. I didn't know what to say at all and the entire class was cheering and people even started filming. I was straight up frozen for a minute and I could feel myself burning up with embarrassment. Of course I wanted to say no, but since it was so public and everyone was waiting for me to say yes, I did and hugged her. Everyone clapped including the teacher and I was mortified. 

One of my buddies asked me if I was okay afterwards since apparently I looked like I was gonna burst into tears and I told him I literally did not expect that at all and I didn't want to say yes. He suggested that I go find her after school or something and explain that to her and I agreed. Now, this girl is really  nice. We had a class together last year and sat next to each other for a majority of it and talked quite a lot. I would say we were friends then, but we haven't spoken more than two times this school year so we've definitely drifted apart. That's why I was completely shocked when she sprung the prom asking on me; usually, people have their friends make sure that the other is at least aware before doing the asking to prevent situations like this. I was contemplating if I should just bite the bullet and go with her, but decided I just couldn't because it is my senior year prom and I was already starting to plan my asking. There's this girl that I've liked for a couple of months now and I recently heard from my friends that she likes me back so I was gonna ask her. 

So I ended up going to the special ed classroom after school where I found her and asked if I could speak to her outside. I told her everything and how I really, really appreciated the gesture, but I was already planning on asking my crush to prom and she was CRUSHED. She started crying really loudly and asked me why I couldn't of just said no and I said that I didn't want to embarrass the two of us in front of all those people.

It's big dog friendly, maintenance is amazing, and it's quiet. I seriously have never had a bad experience here until this. I'm a female who lives alone.

There's a new guy in my neighborhood who has decided to hit on me every single time he sees me. I will admit I have never told him to stop, but because I just get quiet and try to ignore him as much as possible, or answer his gross questions curtly or by walking away.

1,"AITA for leaving the room while my wife was giving birth? | Just to be clear this happened a few years ago, and me and my wife are now parents to a beautiful, healthy girl. This particular incident got brought up because we went to family therapy - not because we're having problems or arguing or anything but because we want to take our marriage to the next level.

I don't quite have an aversion or a phobia of blood but when I see traumatic and/or gruesome things happen then I tend to get really nauseous and/or pass out. A tame example that might seem silly is that when we were watching Endgame last year I momentarily fainted when >!Thor beheaded Thanos!<. I say momentarily because it only lasted for a couple seconds and then I was awake.Another time I was watching a basketball game and somebody broke their leg to a point where the tibia was sticking out of the skin and I threw up my entire life savings. As far as I know (and my GP agrees with me) this is not indicative of any bigger health problems and its not worth taking medication for, since it happens so infrequently.

I was afraid of this happening when my wife was due to give birth and she told me that I should just suck it up - truth be told I wasn't very thrilled with hearing that because I felt like she was dismissing my legitimate concerns and making me out to be a sissy. But eventually I decided that I would try not to worry about what could happen and that I'd cross that bridge if (when) we got there. 

Narrator: It did happen.

I won't get into the gruesome details but I ended up puking, thankfully the nurses had the presence of mind to have buckets just for this purpose but I still got some on my clothes. True to form, I did momentarily faint again and came to slumped over in a chair in the corner of the room surrounded by concerned nurses. At this point I was taking a lot of attention from my wife and I was pretty sure that if I stayed in the room it'd happen again. Thus I made the decision that I had to leave and get myself cleaned up. I did ask her if it was okay with her before I left but as you guys might imagine she wasn't really lucid, all she did was nod her head but she didn't really respond. I felt awful but I felt like it was for the best, and I had a change of clothes and I brought garbage bags so I threw my clothes in the bag and got changed then waited outside the room until it was done.

Basically she feels like I abandoned her when she really needed me to support her, and she does not understand why I couldn't have just....took it.Even though there's literally nothing I can do about my condition. I was moreso afraid of something going wrong with her and the doctors having to split their attention between us, and that was the reason why I left.

About two months ago, I was having a terrible period in my life, and made some changes all at once. I quit my job, moved back to my hometown, ended my relationship, and went off all my meds. It was a very hard couple of months for both myself and my son. We are both starting to feel better and things are getting back to a good place. I am on different meds and have started a new job. My son is doing pretty good at school and is happy to be back in our hometown. 

The issue is that my ex-fiancé got ahold of my mother when we first moved out to let her know what was happening and that I was not in a good place. My son also reached out to my mother when he was feeling particularly down and wanted someone to talk to. She basically blew him off and never bothered to check back on him again. She never contacted me to check in either.

Some backstory: she believes in “tough love” and “codependency” and believes this means that it’s ok to just basically ignore her children (all 3 of us are adults) if they are struggling, or unhappy, or even need to just talk. By ignore, I mean she has already cut my youngest brother (39 yrs) out of her life because he struggles with PTSD and alcoholism and will not check himself into a hospital which is what she thinks he should do. So she refuses to have anything to do with him and basically pretends he doesn’t exist.

In regards to me, she abandoned me at age 1 to be with the man she cheated on my father with and her two babies she had with him. She did eventually get visitation rights and I saw her on the weekends for years. She was physically and verbally abusive for most of my childhood towards me and my (half-) brothers as well. She smoked pot constantly and drank a lot too. 

Over the years I have done a lot of therapy and pretty much got over most of my issues with her, and have had what I thought was a pretty good relationship with her for about 15 years. It was always up and down, but I just went with the flow and up to now, she has been a decent grandmother. 

Fast forward to now. She hasn’t spoken one word to me since I told her I quit my job two months ago, and as I mentioned, she blew my son off when he tried contacting her when he was upset and worried about me.

She is a sophomore in high school, where she excels in all her subjects in school, and is in honors and higher level (junior/senior) classes. She attends a private school, where we pay a pretty hefty tuition, but it was obvious to me and my wife in her middle school years that she would do great there, so we bit the bullet and paid. She has proven us right in every regard.

Sarah is in the eighth grade, and has already begun to excitedly talk about how excited she is about the art program at the private school her sister attends. Sarah has a beautiful heart and is one of the kindest people I know. She is also very talented at art, but the program at our local public high school is good as well. She is not as diligent or hardworking as Abby is (or was at Sarah's age), and can be a bit of a slacker when it comes to STEM. She does alright in English and History, about average. 

Yesterday, we sat down with Sarah and explained to her that the private school was not a good fit for her like it was for Abby, and we are not going to be sending her there. She immediately burst into tears, saying she knew we didn't love her as much, think she was as talented, etc. We assured her time and time again that we did love her, we thought she was very smart and talented, but simply would not fit in at the private school, which is full of straight A students. She asked if we could look into more arts oriented programs for her, and we told her no because we simply do not see the same ratio of monetary value to educational value — Abby is essentially guaranteed a spot in the Ivies, while Sarah would be better suited for an arts school, which we do plan to pay for after she graduates high school. She told us we did not value her, preferred her older sister, etc. Abby overheard all of this and is siding with her sister, saying she will refuse to go to the private school again in the fall unless Sarah is with her. My wife and I are certain they are being melodramatic teenage girls. AITA here?",False,False,4,3,2,3,1,3,Care

So I used to work at a pharmacy as a tech and I was working there for some months until a new pharmacist started working there. I was working the night shift with him and he started talking to me about one thing, then randomly asked how old I was. I was 19 at the time. 

Then we stumbled on the topic about social media. Fast forward, he slid his Snapchat and we chatted. I later find out he was engaged and had confronted him about it. 

After cutting things off with him, he’s been persisting on meeting with me, trying to send me gifts, take me on vacation, etc. He’s been married for over a year now, and now has a kid. He’s still calling and texting me even after I blocked him.

My mom is a software engineer who graduated college at 35 with three kids to support. She made a good career for herself which I'm proud of. My two sisters are both highly educated and very successful like my mom. 

My mom's being nagging on me to go to college for a while now on and off. Not just college but every aspect ofy life. I'm an introvert who apart from work and gym, plays video games and goes out maybe once or twice a month which is enuf for me.I should mention that I'm 27. But her nagging intensified in the past few months. 

Last weekend she invited me for a family get together. It was me, mom and my sisters and their SO's. It was fun and whatever. But in between my mom called me and my eldest sister to the kitchen. I followed. She then proceeded to show me some college flyers where she wanted me to apply. I asked her to stop. I told her I'm not interested in going to college. I'm too old for that now. Plus I'm okay with my job and content. She then proceeded to give this long story about her struggle and how she managed college and 3 kids and all that stuff. She told me that all she wanted is to see her only son successful. And I made her feel as a failure. I just stood and asked to just mind her own business and to take pride in her two successful daughters if I'm a looser. After that i left the kitchen. A couple hours later i silently left. 

My elder sister sends me a long text message which jn short tells me how much of an asshole i was to mom and how i should apologize immediately. I told her I'd do that once she stops treating me like someone's that needs fixing.

1,"AITA for telling gf I'd rather never hang out at her house again after she invited me over ? | TL;DR: girlfriend invited me to her house which was very rundown and made me feel uneasy, I got called an asshole by friend after I told her that I'd rather never visit it again.

My girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for about 2 months now, when we meet up it's either outside or at my place. Whenever I'd bring up going to her place, she'd shoot the idea down, saying that since her sister is recovering from a sickness she needed peace and quiet at the house.

Well yesterday she had a change of heart, and told me that she'd meet at my place then we could go to hers. First of all, her house ended up not being where she told me it would be. At first she said it would be near a popular mall, but it ended up being blocks away and we had to walk to get there, and essentially it was in a different area that is considered ""the slums"". So I really didn't appreciate how she misled me, and that we had to walk in a dangerous area after we got off the bus.

Now when it came to the house itself, not to be insensitive, but it was very rundown and honestly when she first said ""this is it"" I thought it was a joke. The paint was peeling, some of the pipes were visible outside and they were rusty and yellowish. The inside was worse. I mean it was clean, but they had concrete stairs INSIDE THE HOUSE!! The wallpaper was peeling and the kitchen and bathroom tiles were crooked, the appliances there were also very old and so were the cabinets. She made me lunch and it took double the amounts it probably would have took to make in my apartment because the stove couldn't be set on too high. There wasn't a lot of furniture, and the couch they had in the living room was pretty much on its last legs.

Then we went to her room, and honestly felt like some rundown hostel room where they'd hold someone hostage. It had floor tiles in it which wtf, a small bed and closet, and a patchy carpet. Plus medical equipment that she kept there in case her sister needed it. We sat down and she tried to talk and was cracking jokes but all I could feel was unease because I've really never been somewhere like that, so I left after a while and made up an emergency about how my roommate needed me to open the door for him. She insisted on walking me to the bus station and it was awkward.

She texted me at night asking me if everything was alright, and I told her the truth: that I knew that financially her and her family were really struggling because of her sister's medical bills, but that being at her home made me feel uneasy because of how it was and that I preferred that we never hangout there again, and instead either meet up at my place which is much nicer or outside. She texted me back very passive-agressively and then stopped responding to my texts, and when I told a friend about what happened he said I was being a dick for criticizing her home.

0,"AITA for “not taking responsibility” for my bipolar? | I struggled for 10 years with undiagnosed bipolar. During this time I drank heavily, made bad decisions. I had three manic episodes, the last of which was so bad, so traumatic... I finally understood that I needed to do anything and everything to get well. 

I was finally officially diagnosed with bipolar and CPTSD. I started intensive therapy, completely quit drinking, basically did a 180 and have stayed on the straight and narrow ever since. I have no desire to go back to where I was, ie pick up a drink. The meds work great, and I am stable and better than I ever have been.

Turns out though, my very compétant psych team is pretty convinced that my mom is a narcissist and that her constant emotional abuse definitely caused my CPTSD and maybe in fact lead to my bipolar. Although I made bad decisions during my years of being sick, I want to be clear that I never DID anything TO anyone in my family, (Stealing, violence, etc) though I definitely said some things I regret, that I have apologized for. 

I can completely understand how from my fam’s  perspective it was difficult to see me in that state, however as they are stuck in this narcissistic family unit, they can’t seem to grasp that my mom actually played a big part in it.

In any event, I have only ever wanted a good relationship with them, and I though that getting sober and on the right track would have helped with that, but it actually has made relations worse, namely with my little sister who thinks I’m “playing the victim” blaming bipolar  for my years of bad behavior, also for blaming my mom for her abuse. 

For me, I have apologized for my past actions and words. In my view the best way to show my remorse is to take my recovery seriously. I can’t change the past but I can work towards a happy and healthy future. My sister sees this rational as me not owning my past actions, and I resent her, what I see as ignorance about my bipolar (she refuses to look into it to try to understand better).

About 6 months ago my mother moved away and asked my little bro to stay with his friend for two weeks while she moved. But a few days later, she told him he can't live with her because she wants to live alone. So since then he has been trapped at his friend's house.  

At first I tried to help him a lot. Nothing seemed to be useful. I wanted to help him get a job but he says he can't, he's so depressed, because of course after a while his friend got sick of him living rent-free and he feels like his mother doesn't love him (she doesn't). From my end, I hate my mother after this. She also convinced him to move from his friend's house to a hotel for a while but that cost all his savings and he had to move back, he regrets it so much and I thought it was a bad idea from the start.   

He's out of money for food so I gave him $300 .At first, I'll do anything for him, let him stay in my apartment on the couchm spent all my days off hanging out with him trying to calm him down. After so long... the situation hasn't advanced at all for six months. I've been so stressed and I don't want to do anytihng about it.

We separated when my second was born. We had pretty equal custody for the next two years, then I got an amazing job offer in another state. I was able to work out a plan with my ex where I had the kids for the school year and she got them for Christmas and the summer. She did not want to move, but she let me take the kids because there were much better education opportunities and housing options where I moved to.

This has been out plan for the last 4 years. My wife and I do pretty much all of the parental hard work like homework and discipline while my ex gets to take them on trips and treat them on breaks. It's tough, but I'm closer with the kids than she is. I also feel bad that my wife, who has raised both kids for almost their entire lives, and who has put in so much effort, gets no credit. She doesn't have any legal claim to the kids and if I died, she might never be able to see them again.

This has been bothering me for a while and I really want my wife to be able to legally adopt my children. She is their primary caretaker and does the majority of the hard work, and my kids love her and call her ""mom."" I very gently breached the idea with my ex that she sign over her parental rights to my wife. I told her we would still make custody agreements so she could see the kids in the summer and I would never cut them off from her, but she hasn't done the hard work of raising them like my wife has. My ex went nuts me like I've never seen before and accused me of parental alienation. She never once expressed interest in moving to where I am in the last 4 years, but now she's saying she's going to move to my state and use my request as evidence that I'm alienating the kids. When I told my wife, I thought she'd appreciate my gesture but she's mad at me too and says I was out of line. Was an I being an asshole just by asking?

I also buy the more expensive ones that have more hydrating properties to them, because of aforementioned dry eyes so I always buy the exact amount I need, not more. 

The next day, we were planning on going to a theme park. My friend is pretty scatterbrained and forgot to pack hers in her overnight bag. She has slightly worse eyesight than me and asked if she could have my second disposable pair. I told her sorry, no, because I was planning to switch halfway. She did have a pair of old glasses of hers that weren’t the correct power but she didn’t wear them out of fear they’d fall off a ride.

He cooks sometimes but my parents end up babying him. My mom makes him breakfast almost every morning and does his laundry because he is too glued to his video games. He works a part time job but other than that, its just video games. My parents have been trying to encourage him to go back to school, whether his old uni or community college, or apply to a different job (he hates his customer job.) and he just shuts down and tells them ""yeah yeah now get out of my room."" and slams the door and goes back to video games. My dad is in his 70s and still works to keep the family stable and my mom works everyday and gets one day off a month if shes LUCKY.

0,"AITA for not doing anything about our noisy tenants? | I bought a new house this year and now rent out the old one, have had tenants in there for a few weeks now.

When we lived there we didn’t get on with the neighbours because the house had paper thin walls and so could hear every movement, which we generally leant to ignore. The neighbour had 2 young girls who she would scream and shout at all the time as well as a dog which would bark which became harder and harder to ignore and accept.

To put it in perspective so you know I’m not being pathetic here’s a few examples as I understand that sometimes children do play up and voices need to be raised and dogs can also bark - I have a dog who barks.

Example 1 - earlier this year, on a sunny Sunday morning at around 8 o’clock. The neighbours two girls (6/7 and 9/10) woke up and went into the mums room. An acceptable time for this to happen. The girls were screamed at to ‘go back to fucking bed’. 

Example 2 - the TV remote has gone missing. Instead of politely asking the girls the mum screamed up the stairs ‘where’s the fucking remote’

Example 3 - the dog barked in the day, I can deal with this but more often than not, it would quietly but consistently bark in the early hours of the morning (2/3/4 am) and wake me up. Her way of stopping the dog from barking was to shout at it. 

Today we had a text from her which began;

‘I’m so sorry if your ever heard us be noisy I never realised how paper thin the walls were’

Total bullshit as when the dog was barking, I would shout through the walls and she responded - she knows how thin the walls are!

‘Your tenants are so noisy that my daughter can no longer sleep in her own bedroom and they [the girls] have been exposed to the ‘C’ word’

Not that I feel insecure that she had feelings for him, but that ultimately I hated this guy and can’t match her feelings. 

I never knew him personally. The first time I ever heard about him was early on in our relationship when my fiancé showed me messages he had sent her of him and his friend talking shit about me and trying to get her to hangout with them. I brushed it off as a jealous ex. Why wouldn’t he feel anything but dislike for me?  The feeling was mutual.

I fell quickly for my fiancé and in the first year took her on a trip she had been wanting to go on for her birthday. In the middle of conversation at dinner, he calls and she answers. I felt extremely disrespected and we had a discussion about him. She told me all about how there were no feelings for him, that he used to hit her and pull her hair and threaten to come to her school and beat her up. I took her word and moved passed it, but not without new disdain for him. As time went by in our relationship, more details about him would come up here and there, none of them flattering.

She told me that wasn’t true and that he had only ever pulled her hair and started explaining that by saying she had made him angry.

We've already decided not to get back together. I thought he was kidnapped or went missing for christ sake. I was single and didn't want him back. But that raised questions about the dog. I've cared for the dog for these seven months. I paid for its food, for grooming, vets. I had the dog more than he had at this point: the puppy was 5 months old but he only owned it for three weeks before his ""adventure"".

Here’s the story:

I have a one month old daughter and a boyfriend. My boyfriend has not been able to find a job for several months and we’ve struggled financially in the past even when he had a job. When I go back to work after my maternity leave we wouldn’t be able to afford daycare, but I make too much to qualify for any government aid. Because of this situation MIL had offered to watch the baby in our apartment for a small amount of money so we could work and not be in an even worse financial situation. I had even turned down a spot on a list at a daycare because we had agreed to have her watch our baby in our own apartment. 

Now that it’s getting closer for me to go back, she came back to us and told us she would not watch the baby in our apartment. Instead she wanted to watch the baby in her apartment instead. She gave valid reasons as to why she didn’t want to come to ours anymore to watch her (the distance driving, being away from home all the time, etc) and i understand her feelings about it because she was doing us a giant favor. It was a lot to ask of someone especially since we would’ve been paying her very little. 

The issue with this arrangement comes from the fact that she lives in a very bad neighborhood. We have had packages stolen from her house, people have broken into their cars and stolen electronics, etc. There have also been complaints about people coming up to their apartment constantly asking them for things as well as when someone has broken in before. It’s a horrible environment. My boyfriend and I both pray that they would be able to live someone safer, but it doesn’t seem like it will happen any time soon. 

After some talking, we decided that my boyfriend would be a SAHD instead of having MIL watch the baby in that neighborhood. We were both too concerned that something horrible would happen (as patterns tend to suggest it would). MIL seemed to accept the decisión rather well, but didn’t want to accept that we didn’t want our baby there for safety reasons. She believes that the area is safe despite having told us most of these bad things about it herself. She even argued that nothing bad would ever happen there.

0,"AITA for suggesting that my nephew's bad behaviour is mostly due to parenting to my Brother? | My Nephew has always been a bit of a problem child. He has been Smoking since he was 9 years old, has been expelled from 3 schools. He pretty much stays home and plays on his phone all day and doesn't go to school anymore. He has also had several run ins with the law enforcement for underage driving, drinking, unruly behaviour and so on. He's sixteen years old now and his only friends are other 30 year olds sitting at home and wasting their lives. 

Me and my family recently shifted to our native country, where my nephew lives. His parents, i.e my brother and his wife cannot combat his behaviour at all. My brother left him in my place so that he has no access from his devices and his friends (who are most likely drug users). 

It was incredibly difficult to live with this child the first few days. He's obnoxious, rude and destructive. I put some rules into place, like do your chores(doing his dishes, making bed and doing laundry once a week). The same rules everyone in the family follows. He didn't like it at all. He bullied my kid, tried to burn a blanket, stole my car keys, broke some stuff. He did all this expecting that I'd kick him out. But I didn't. Whenever he broke a rule, we would remove all forms of entertainment and he would get bored and eventually he would do as told. We'd sit him down and explain that actions have consequences. He also earned an allowance by helping me clear the attic(old house) and do some repair work, and compensation would be taken out of that if he broke something. We also prohibited smoking, instead I gave him nicotine gum at regular intervals to prevent withdrawal.

While he was extremely resistant for a while, he eventually gave in and started doing things without being told. He stayed with us for 3 months and there has been a massive change in his attitude. While he is still very rude and obnoxious, he stopped smoking, is not destructive, does his chores and has expressed an interest in going back to school. He also opened up that his Father was always busy, and didn't care if he lived or was dead. He told me that his mother would cart him around therapist to therapist, and whenever they would express that he has a particular disorder she would change doctors. From what I learned, my brother is a workaholic and his mother is heavily into alternative treatments, MLM's, and other things so she's away from home a lot.

When I took him back, I sat them both down and told them that I felt that they both should stay home more and look after their kid. He was very starved for attention and love, and he needed them both. They were extremely offended, and basically banned the kid from talking to me. It's been a few weeks and I have tried to contact him several times but I can't reach him.

He didn't like the joke box, I knew immediately despite the fact he said thank you and accepted it. So I acknowledged that he didn't like it, and apologized for getting him a gift he didn't enjoy. He responded by assuring me he did like it and thanking me again, because, like I said, he's polite. Later my youngest told me she never liked that I did that, and when I pressed she said it was unpleasant when I acknowledged a gift was unwanted. She said it makes the receiver feel guilty and is a quick way to get double gratitude on a present. I told her she had it all wrong, and was overreacting.

This doesn't fly with the daughter who sleeps on the floor rather than use the pillow which is different from her preferred pillow.

She asked for help on a Facebook post to see if anyone can pick up this specific memory foam pillow because she doesn't drive and doesn't want to bring her kid on a walk in the current weather and situation. I offered to help.

So I get the pillow, it's $44.99. I deliver it, and she hands me a $50.

I insist on not taking the money, I want to be altruistic for a friend, and she really does insist.

I run my own business and make decent money, this $50 is nothing to me to be blunt. I tell her as much and she relents but then posts a public post on Facebook explaining how she doesn't want pity from her ""friends"" (quotation emphasis hers) and she no longer replies to my messenger messages.

1,"AITA for telling my SIL that she can't say her stillborn baby matters less than her living children? | As background: my SIL had 3 living children before her stillbirth, and then gave birth to another living child 2 years later. Her 4 Earth-side children have fairly common names, like Emma, Lauren, Sophie, and Andrew. Her stillborn daughter has a more unorthodox name, something like Soulstyce. I have one son born sleeping and had several miscarriages. I have no living children, but I'm a mom to a little boy up in Heaven.

Anyways, at Christmas, many of our family members got to meet their new baby for the first time. The subject of how his name was chosen came up, which lead to my grandmother asking why their stillborn daughter had such an ""unusual"" name compared to their living children.

My SIL explained that they gave their daughter a ""guilty pleasure"" name because it mattered less. She said she wouldn't put her living children through the experience of having such an uncommon name, but that it didn't matter when it came to their daughter because she didn't have a life to live with her name. She even joked that she spent a quarter of the time picking out their daughter's name that they did choosing their other children's names because ""it just didn't matter"" and they ""could do whatever.""

It hurt me to hear her say that. I've spent six years feeling like I have no right to call myself a mother and feeling excluded from the ""mom's club"" because my son died from circumstances beyond my control before I even got to hold him. To have my SIL, who I have supported through each and every one of her pregnancies, who I held and comforted through her stillbirth, say that her child *didn't matter* because she wasn't alive - that hurt. It felt very intensely personal. I was right across from her at the table and she said it with no remorse. I don't care if it took her 5 minutes or 5 days to choose a name for her child, I care that she said it didn't matter.

I haven't said a word about it since then. But I lost my job, I've had too much time to think, and I keep replaying the whole thing over in my mind. I've been stewing about it, I keep drawing away from her and I feel guilty. So, I called her and told her that I had been really hurt by what she said. She was very callous, immediately, telling me to get over myself and not tell her how to live her life. I got very upset and told her she couldn't talk about her daughter like she mattered less and she just outright said, ""She does matter less."" I just started to cry. I hung up and my husband consoled me for a while, but my brother called me to chew me out, saying I'd made his wife upset and she was already busy with their children and she didn't need to babysit me as well.

John is under 6 months old. 

My parents completely support my sister financially as well as her children. She gets child support for the eldest, but puts that money into her retirement fund. 

She has been sleeping with George on and off for a while. George is still actively married, but stays with my sister at my parents house when they are out of town or she stays with him at his grandparents house. When she goes to George’s grandparents house, she takes John with her and leaves Gilbert at home with my parents. She does not call Gilbert, or come to see him while she is staying with George. This leaves Gilbert very sad, he says he misses his brother, John, and he knows that it’s his fault his mom leaves him because he “can’t act right”.  Gilbert does act out when his mom is present. When he makes her angry or acts out she yells and screams at him. She gets easily annoyed and overwhelmed by him so she spends the majority of her time yelling at Gilbert when they are together. 

I also have two children and I try to take them to see my parents fairly often. If my sister happens to be there, she is very rude to me and my older child and she criticizes my parenting. My older child is 2, has speech problems, and is in speech therapy. She thinks it’s because of me that he is behind.

I said she needed to treat both of her children the same or leave Gilbert with my parents for good because everyone was happier when she was away not causing chaos. My sister did not really respond, just repeatedly said “okay” sarcastically. 

My mother has contacted me today to tell me that I need to ignore the behavior from my sister and “love her like Jesus”. She said that I have also made mistakes and I can’t judge my sister. My mother also said that me exploding has made her feel like she has to choose sides and she thinks I want her to turn on my sister.

Instead of getting out of the car he told me that I should have brought a jacket and he didnt want to get cold as he sat there in his long sleeve shirt.

0,"WIBTA if I don't take in my sister's cat? | Repost to remove no-no words. 

I'll keep this short: The wife (42W) and I (42M) have six cats, all rescues. We're the only real ""cat people"" in our families. My sister contacted us yesterday to ask if we would take in her cat, due to my niece's emergent allergies. We've never met the cat, so we asked for a basic description. Male, 1-2 years old, neutered, healthy, and he's had ""the surgery"" because ""he was destroying my furniture."" That final detail gave us pause (paws?). We are firmly against this practice for all the reasons, but my sister is like my mom, and thinks that furniture and ""stuff"" is more important than the health and well-being of a pet. My mother has disposed of pets for nebulous reasons, including mere convenience, and I have no reason to think my sister wouldn't do the same. 

Our issues: Our cats were all raised from kittens by us,  and our oldest girl is 16 and might be near her Rainbow Bridge crossing. She's frail and timid, and we don't know how this new cat will interact with her, much less our other rowdy and rambunctious demons. We recently lost two cats, suddenly, so the hierarchy is still in flux, and we're dealing with the grief, too. 

We want what's best for this poor cat, and for our own clowder, but we're just not sure it's a good idea. I'm disabled and will be home to deal with any adjustment period (as best I can), and we're old hands at cats. I've been chewing on this a while, and could use some input.

0,"AITA for getting annoyed about having to give up my seat at the bus stop? | Background: I attend University in a city approximately 2 hours from where I live. I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I’m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city’s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there’s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I’m also 5 months pregnant. 

So, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I’m usually pretty exhausted. As it’s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn’t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She’s a little older, but I wouldn’t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says ‘You can sit here’ beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. 

My pregnancy wasn’t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I’m sitting down 😒 But it’s very obvious when I’m standing, many people ask me if I’m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. 

Anyway, I don’t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I’m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn’t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant.

So, I've have a cousin I was close with through most of my childhood, and some of college. It wasn't like we had a falling out it's just as we got older life got tougher for us to spend as much time together as when we were younger. Fast-forward. She's married and has 3 kids. And, a week or so ago her youngest who was dealing with a lot of health issues since birth sadly passed away.

The funeral was a week ago and my family lives literally all over the country. It's pretty rare to get the extended family together like this. The event is terrible, but a lot of people took solace of being able to have everyone together. So, my husband and I have been trying for eight months to get pregnant and the morning of hopping on the plane I took a pregnancy test. Positive. 

So, boom. After the funeral we are all gathered at the church for the repass since they made a lot of food for everyone. My sister and mom are at my table and my sister says something along the lines of heading to her place to drown herself in wine. And, I said I was totally down to do the same after we left. My husband like squeezes my hand under the table and I look at him he's frowning and I mentally realize ""oh crap I'm probably super pregnant and can't drink."" 

Then, I tell my sister, ""I can hang out but can't drink."" They all saw this interaction and my mom just flat out asks am I pregnant. And, I tell her yes because she knows we've been struggling to make it happen. Then, the barrage of questions ""how long,"" ""when I'd find out,"" ""etc."" That passes and I'm still eating after they have left from the table and suddenly like person by person comes up to me with messages of congratulations. It wasn't like a parade of people waiting in line but randomly folks would drop by saying they heard the good news. It was such a rush hearing all the words of encouragement especially after doing treatments and trying so much.

Until suddenly my cousin shows up tears in her eyes. She accuses me of taking the spotlight on one of the worst days of her life and why wouldn't I wait to tell people. I tried to explain how it all happened and she didn't want to listen. I didn't intend to make anything about  me. But, I had been trying for months and I really wanted to tell my mom in person at some point but she asked then and there so I didn't want to lie.

1,"AITA for not paying for my sister-in-law to join us on Spring Break? | I married my husband from another country, happens to be a 3rd world country where his family is very poor. We live in the US and have good jobs and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle with our two young daughters (ages 5, 7). I work hard so that I can save and travel, it's what we do as a family and what we really enjoy. Important Note: We are not rich, not by any standards. We just prioritize travel and creating experiences over buying things. We've visited several continents with our kids and have plans to travel to Mexico this upcoming Spring Break.

My husband has a kid sister whom we became guardians over 2 years ago--she is now a senior in high school. I initiated this and brought her from her country to live with us so that she could have a better future. This decision obviously created lots of change for our family--our two daughters now share a room instead of having their own, we have family dinner together every night as a family of five, I am her advocate getting her into a great high school, finding her counseling for trauma she has experienced, creating structure for things like homework, a chore chart around the house with allowance, drivers ed, doctor appointments, planning for university, etc etc. Last year I paid for her to do a 6 week trip back to her country to visit her friends/family and over XMas this year I am bringing her with us (obviously--it's the holidays) as we visit my parents in Arizona--she'll get a 3 week fun trip at a resort-like location with the rest of us. I've encouraged her several times to consider getting a part time job so she can pay for gas when she starts driving (we are providing her a vehicle at no cost) and other things she might want to buy (makeup, post-high school travel or other plans, etc). She has yet to do this even though she says she wants one.

So the question--AITA? We are planning a Spring Break trip to Mexico and I'll be honest, it's a bit expensive.

Husband blew up at my and told me it was unreasonable to leave her at home and that if we go we need to pay for her ticket too. I said that if she wanted to go she could have gotten a part time job and shown initiative in saving money for things that are important to her. Our relationship with this young woman is very good, but it is not one of parent/child--we are like her aunt/uncle helping her the most we can.

The person taking our order then asked if she wanted that hot or cold.  I interrupted the exchange to say ""an iced latte is cold."" I immediately got the death stare from my wife and I'm sure the employee saw it and I didn't say anything else.  

Afterward my wife yelled at me for being so rude.  I defended my case by saying her job was to take your order.  When someone orders an iced drink it isn't necessary to immediately ask if they want it hot or cold.  So she must not have been paying attention.  I also reminded her that I am a smart ass by nature and I didn't really mean anything by it.  But you could see a downshift in the employees upbeat attitude afterward.

I think I could've diffused the situation at the time but my wife reacted so quickly that I didn't have a chance to follow up with the ""I'm just messing with ya."" And I think she certainly did deserve to be messed with but I wasn't trying to ruin her morning.

I’m not coping well.  Anxiety and a PTSD response to this situation (plus a difficult birth), juggling this plus having a toddler at home, and living an hour from the hospital - I’ve been hanging on by a thread.  After a near-mental breakdown, I accepted I need more help, and reluctantly took my MIL up on her offer to fly out from across the country to stay with us for a while to help us with the house and the toddler while my husband works and I attend to our preemie in the NICU. 

She showed up yesterday coughing, sneezing, and with watery, runny eyes. She’s well aware that I have been extremely paranoid about germs and transmitting illnesses to the NICU, or, getting sick myself and not being able to see my baby.  She didn’t give us any warning she was sick.  She said that she started feeling sick a few days before her flight.  Had she let us know she was sick, we’d have had her change her flight to a week later so there was no risk of contagion (she bought a ticket that could be changed without a fee, and she was planning on staying the rest of the month).  

After having several panic attacks about this since she arrived, and talking with the NICU team, I told my husband that I would feel better if she left until she was no longer contagious. The NICU team said that it might be okay if she wore a mask and was extremely careful about sanitizing, but it was still a risk.  With my mental health already hanging on by a thread, this is just an added stressor I can’t bear.   My husband was more on board with having her just be really careful with washing her hands, but I’ve already been seeing her coughing on things, not washing hands after blowing her nose, etc. I can’t follow her around constantly to be sure she’s following good sanitary practices. 

My husband was reluctant, but we sat her down, and explained that we really appreciated her coming, but explained exactly why it’s so risky for us or our baby to get sick right now.

So I decide to get a sitter for Friday evening (he works Sat-Wed). I got REALLY nice tickets to a local baseball game (which he LOVES to attend!) I asked him BEFORE I bought the tickets if this is a good idea and he said “yes thanks!” GREAT! Green light given!

Then I remembered that it’s my Dad’s birthday too (their birthdays are 4 days a part). They get along pretty well. So I figured, hey maybe two birds one stone? Neither my dad or husband like to be fussed about on their birthdays but definitely appreciate doing a little thing. So I asked husband if he would mind if I had my dad tag along with us for the game. He said he didn’t care. I asked again, and said “This first and foremost is your birthday present, so I just want to make sure you are OK with this, it’s your decision” and he just kind of brushed it off again. I asked again a few days later. He responded he didn’t care again. Alright, he can’t be bothered to make these little decisions and he says he doesn’t care, so I invited my dad. 

My dad is VERY excited about going to the game too. So I set up the baby sitter for the kids. I work until 5. Sitter comes at 6. Game starts at 7. 

Tomorrow is the game. This morning, husband said to me “How about we skip the game, and go to dinner and a movie instead?” I asked why. He said “The game doesn’t start until 7, it probably won’t end until 9. I have to be up early for work” I said “Okay but I am not sure how dinner and a movie would get us home earlier? We don’t have a sitter until 6. And I already got the tickets to the game. And I already invited my dad”. 

His face dropped. He said “I thought that was MY decision?” I said “Well it was, but you just kept saying you didn’t care, and I figured you really didn’t care, so I invited him”

He stopped talking and just said “k”. I can tell he is upset. I said “I’m sorry but I did try to ask what you wanted.

0,"WIBTA if I get a purebred rather than a rescue? | Context: My mom is one of the top dog obedience handlers in the country. She trains and shows springer spaniels, and I grew up with 3-5 springers in the house at any given time. When I was 12, she bought me a springer, Luna, to show and train and I spent a good portion of my high school years in the obedience ring. Luna passed away five years ago, and I haven't had a dog since.

My husband and I have been planning to get a dog for more than a year. The reason we've waited so long is because my mom occasionally breeds litters to further her line of springers. She currently has one bitch that can be bred who was supposed to come into season in August. She still hasn't come into season eight months later, and we're getting to the point where we can't wait forever. We are planning to start trying for a baby this fall, and since I'm going to be the one training our dog, I'd like to get puppy settled and house trained before I'm potentially dealing with morning sickness, etc..

My husband and I talked this over and we decided that if my mom's dog isn't pregnant by June, we will get a different dog. I would love nothing more than to have one of my mom's springers, but it's more important to me to just get a dog than to get a dog from my mom's line. 

I would still prefer to get a springer. I know this breed like the back of my hand, and I plan to train the dog in obedience and potentially agility. I want an outgoing, high-energy working dog. This dog would be a companion first, but would also be my partner in this sport. It's important to me to get a puppy so I can properly socialize it, especially by bringing it around my friends' kids so it's used to children by the time we have our own. 

I've talked through the dog situation with a few friends, and have told them my plans to get a springer even if my mom's litter doesn't pan out. I had a few people recommend shelters where they got their dogs. I am open to looking at rescue puppies, but I'm leaning much more heavily toward getting a springer from a reputable breeder. 

Pretty much everyone I've told about my plans to get a purebred have been judgmental and unsupportive. I've been scolded with the ""adopt, don't shop"" mantra and asked why I would buy a purebred when so many shelter dogs need loving homes. I think rescuing a dog is a wonderful thing, and I give people who choose that option a lot of credit. But I don't agree with this idea that shelters are the ONLY morally acceptable option for getting a dog. 

I'm sorry, but I do not want a dog with built in behavioral issues. Shelter dogs are a toss up in terms of temperament, potential health issues, and how the puppy was socialized early on. I do not want an abused dog that will be fearful or potentially aggressive.

But what’s most annoying is whenever Nico does sit with my husband, which is pretty much whenever I’m not around cause he’s an affectionate dog, my husband makes a huge deal about it. He’ll call me over from my home office to look, make me stop cooking dinner to come over and see, constantly ask me to take pictures of the dog sitting with him. He’ll also talk non-stop about it. If I’m out and return home, my husband is always sure to tell me how Nico cuddled with him all afternoon. He even tells our family and friends almost anytime we see them. He’s gotten some reactions from family members along the lines of “so?” and “yeah, that’s what dogs do”, but that doesn’t stop him from boasting about how much Nico loves him. 

Here’s the thing, after more than a year, this behavior is starting to grate on my nerves. At first, I thought it was cute. When it persisted past the “honeymoon phase”, I just tried to ignore it. I’d avoid looking over if I could, and when he’d inevitably call for my attention I would just give a quick glance and a smile. No more coo-ing or aww-ing. I thought the novelty would wear off but he’s still doing it and I’m getting tired of being interrupted when I’m doing something so I could stop and look at this very ordinary dog-human interaction. I’ve never said anything because I know it’s a relatively petty issue and I don’t want to make my husband feel bad, plus I know he’s just insecure about the dog favoring me, but it’s really getting annoying. I burnt my hand cooking last week because my husband suddenly called out loudly from the other room and I got startled thinking he needed help when it was really so he could say “don’t we look so cute?” because the dog was in his lap.

I bought some homeopathic ""calming"" thing and told her that it would relax her before her test. She immediately questioned it, saying that taking a sedative before driving a car would be dangerous so I had to lie through my teeth and tell her it was a very very mild sedative. She took it and bizarrely claimed it made her worse...she went to the doctor claiming that she might be allergic to it (again its basically water) the doctor apparently said that was unlikely but didn't explain why.

I am nearly done my stuff for the day anyways. I call up my friend and supervisor. Tell him the situation and ask if he can cover my last 6 stops. He says ""Pick him up in the work truck, go back to the shop, go home for the day and take care of him and say hi for me, I'll handle the rest""

I asked if he talked to my supervisor. He says Yes but that I was told to finish my run, then go to the shop, grab my personal vehicle and go get him. I said ""how does that make sense? By the time I was done it would have been around 3 and time to pick him up like normal""
 I said listen I'm coming in tomorrow. I'm not quitting.
Now I called my supervisor.
Explained everything and he acted as if he was not in the loop as to why I was in trouble, which I doubted. I lay it out for him and the response I get ""You're making a huge deal out of nothing""

I responded:
""I'm risking getting fired over you allowing me to do something, if anything, you should be fired buddy.""

He is an alcoholic,  addicted to drugs and was violent towards my mother when they were together. 

There were also some other aligations I can't say as they weren't proven,  and neither me or my sisters were old enough to remember anyway.  

After my parents split,  my father stayed in the house forcing my mother into emergency housing with us.  My mother would pay him to be in our lives be it taking care of us for a weekend or taking us out somewhere.  And when he took care of himself he would leave me as a 5-7 year old in charge of my 2 younger sisters.  Sometimes he would leave us with a babysitter while he went to the pub,  and we were frequently left around family for a few hours here and there or just left in the house with a friend we wouldn't know to watch over us. 

He would make empty promises and never follow through,  he would yell at me for things he was told off for when taking care of us and it was overall not a nice environment.  He has never payed a penny towards us unless made to by his partner for Christmas gifts.  

When I was 8 my mother blocked contact with him due to a court ruling he cannot be left alone with us while we are under 16 until he has gone through family therapy with us.

My mom has dementia. She is completely losing it. Can't complete simple tasks, starting to shit herself, is almost a 10-second-Tom. She has no idea how old I am (25F, youngest of 4) or where I live, etc. 

In addition to the dementia she has severe scoliosis that has been endangering her organs for the past few years, emphysema while she continues to smoke who knows how many cigarettes a day (often having two lit at once b/c she forgets she's smoking one), and some other health issues.

She lives with my dad about an hour away. My dad still works full time, two days a week from home. She is driving him nuts and he is so stressed out. She constantly accuses him of stealing her stuff (like candles or her slippers) - something that is common with people with dementia. She refuses to sleep or eat a lot of the time, magnifying her symptoms. She forgets when family visit or when my dad takes her out (probably 6 days a week) and then gets mad no one takes her anywhere. I'm aware it is all part of the dementia, but it makes things so hard.

I want to move out of state and I won't do it while she is still alive. I'm also worried I'm going to lose my dad before my mom because he is under so much stress. He has high blood pressure and diabetes. The pain I, snd the rest of my family, have from seeing my mom like this is almost unbearable. It's not the woman I remember raising me, and in fact I'm starting to forget how she once was.

Roughly 2 years ago I was diagnosed with brain cancer. They also found metastasis from the tumor all the way down my spine. I went through chemotherapy and radiation as a result. One possible side effect of the treatment was that I would become infertile. So I had my sperm frozen before the treatment just to be on the safe side and I really did become infertile. 

The problem is that I don't want to have biological children. I also suffer from major depression and my early 20s were absolutely awful as a result. It took me several years just to become a functioning member of society and I still go to therapy and take antidepressants to this day. There's also a history of depression in my family. My mom and my uncle have also been diagnosed with depression and they think that my grandmother also suffered from it.

Because of that I decided that I don't want to have biological children. I just don't want to see my children go through the same problem as I did. I know that wouldn't necessarily happen, but I don't want to take any chances. A large part of my life has been absolutely awful because of depression to the point where I was seriously thinking about taking my own lifefor many years.

Recently my girlfriend and I have been talking a lot about having children. I absolutely love her and definitely want to marry her and start a family with her, but I don't want to have biological children. I would be okay with either a sperm donor or adoption. She doesn't want either of these options though and definitely wants me to be the biological father of her children.

She says that just because depression has been a problem in my family that that doesn't mean my children will suffer from it, too. And while that is true I still don't want to take a chance. The thing is she never knew me when I my depression was really bad. We've known each other for three years and have been together for two years now.

A few days ago I mentioned that I'm thinking about getting rid of my frozen sperm. She immediately started crying and begged me to keep it. I 100% made up my mind on this topic though. I'm not going to have biological children with anyone. I think it's irresponsible and I couldn't live with myself if my children had to go through the same struggles as I did.

I rented a nice ass car for the day to take her out, bought her flowers/candy, wrote her 5 nice cards, took her to lunch, movie, store, and had an evening activity planned as well. While she was ok at first, she started to get cranky 5 hours into the day because she didn't have a chance to get coffee because I was taking her around from 1 place to another. (I will say that my wife is extremely religious about her coffee. She knows what she likes and doesn't like when it comes to coffee and needs ONE cup every day). To be fair, I did have a lot of stuff planned today. She was also stressed because she had a job interview (she is currently unemployed) and I went with her to the interview in the fancy car so that we could start the planned day of activities right after. Just today, here is what she complained about:

not having coffee all day when i know that's the only thing she needs every day (she doesn't care about food as much as she cares about getting her one cup of coffee)

me spending $ on a fancy car (when she doesn't care for fancy cars and because we only rode in it fror about 20 minutes each way and the car was parked all day in the city)

me taking her to my favorite weed store as part of the surprise and having to wait 30 minutes for the guy to show up to the store (if i had told her what we were doing, she would have gotten coffee in that time but i kept it a surprise)

me giving her nice or fancy gifts when she doesn't want or care for them

me making her walk in the cold when she had thin dress pants on for the interview and not allowing her any time to change. . .

me getting upset when she doesn't show appreciation for my efforts

me not taking medication for my depression

me not going to sleep on time (reason for my tiredness)

He has to wake up at 7:00am to get to school. I called his mom (we’re divorced and live separately) and expressed this concern, but she said she wasn’t worried. I told her he’d have to go to bed at a normal hour when he was staying here. She basically said if I could make that happen, more power to me. 

So I told our son it’s fine to stay up every once in a while to catch up if behind or in the middle of a big crunch, but that it couldn’t be a habit, and he needed to have the lights out by 12:00. 

He said that wasn’t possible, so I went through his work with him and helped him prioritize what was worth investing full effort in and what was ok to just do the minimum on. 

He wasn’t goofing off or managing his time poorly, he does his homework in the living room, we can see him working. His school assigns 4-5 hours of homework a night and it’s just not feasible. So we cut it down to 2 with smart prioritizing. 

Then he went back to his mom’s place. She called me furious, saying it’s good that our son has the discipline to apply himself fully to school, and that if his friends are staying up that late (they are, we talk to other parents) then there’s no reason he shouldn’t. 

I told her his health is paramount and he needs to sleep, especially at this age, so if she had another suggestion I was all ears. She said I was stunting his future potential and teaching him poor work habits and that I was an ass for suggesting it’s ever reasonable to give half effort to any schoolwork.

I walked past it on my way to the entrance and saw that the driver side window was rolled all the way down. Right smack in the center console in one of the cup holders was my husband's wallet. Anyone could have swiped it, so I grabbed it and threw it in my purse before entering the restaurant. Fast forward through dinner and it's time to pay the check. My husband realizes his wallet isn't on him and goes to his car to grab it, except it isn't there anymore. He can't figure out the last time he saw it. I told him we'd worry about it later and that I'd cover dinner. My husband spent the next day looking for his wallet and had even cancelled his cards. Then this morning he said he couldn't find his wallet and that he was going to the DMV on his lunch break to get his driver license reissued. I finally told him I had his wallet the entire time and explained how and why it was in my possession. He was totally pissed and called me a jerk for being childish just to prove a point.

The questions were to help you figure out your purpose in life. Lately, I've been wanting to connect with him more so I thought this would be a great way to bond and learn more about each other.

 I get to the first question, which was ""When were you happiest in life?"" He was telling me some experiences including when we first started dating. I was touched and added on when we would sneak glances at each other from across the room.  When I was explaining it, I did so rather clumsily, and I said, ""you would look at me, and I would look at you"" and while I was talking to him, he burst into a bad rendition of Sweet Caroline.

 I thought that was rude and I felt embarrassed about trying to open up to him about the good times. It might have been more tolerable if he at least let me finish what I was saying. I felt the moment was ruined and I told him so. We powered through a few more questions until I brought up the joke again.

 I told him it was upsetting especially since I wanted us to have a nice moment and I was trying to be positive for once and bring up a good memory. He told me that by joking he was being vulnerable to me and it showed he was listening to me. I responded by telling him I thought it was stupid. He said he can't have an authentic conversation with me and be comfortable if I can't let him joke and now the whole conversation with him felt fake and reserved.

Ive been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.

While we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.

I organized all of these pictures into three ""Chapters"" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.

0,"AITA for not helping my elderly neighbor on the daily | Hey all, I just moved into a new building about 4 months ago and it has been pretty nice for the most part. I have this one elderly woman as a neighbor, probably in her 80s, who has almost everyday for the past 2 months come knocking on my door for various requests of help she may need.

Some context, I work from home so always am home pretty much and she knows this so I feel obliged to open the door if she knocks. My work is pretty time consuming and requires my attention and it's very distracting to everyday have someone come over and ask for help. My landlady other neighbors have all yelled at her at some point for the same reason and she has been warned to not bother other neighbors already, but she still comes to my door and I really don't want to have to report an old lady.

Most of the time I do try to help because I feel bad, but everytime I help I get stuck listening to her talk for like 5 minutes while slowly trying to leave the room. She has asked me for everything from going downstairs to open the door for a friend of hers, changing lightbulbs, checking her voicemail, changing the heat.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year and living together for about two months. Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. 

We can’t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we’re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we’re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she’ll get up while I’m sleeping etc etc. I know she can’t help it, and she’s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it’s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. 

I always have to pause a movie we’re watching or something she’ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don’t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point.

I have always been wealthy, but very good with my money. When we started dating I made sure to let him know I have no self-control when it comes to animals in need and I would adopt any and all animals that needed me.

We have a granny flat outside that I use to keep the rest of my animals.

She's an incredibly underweight female rat (about half the weight she should be) as well as a URI. She's been checked out by my vet and my vet is confident she'll be completely fine. My boyfriend got so angry at me and said he's sick of all these animals and if I didn't stop rescuing them he'd leave me.

I told him he was being unreasonable since it's my house and he doesn't see the animals all that often. He responded saying he hates rodents and he hates that I walk around with them on my shoulder constantly (along with handling other animals). He told me it's not fair to him to not tell him I got a new pet until after I got it and I told him it's none of his business what I do in my house.

0,"AITA for telling someone not to eat something? | So here's my story. My father & I are from a country that does sausage rolls but we live in America... Americans don't really do sausage rolls. So my father makes a couple tray fulls for us that we freeze and can just throw into the oven for an easy dinner. We don't do it often because we really enjoy them & want them to last, especially since my father making this last batch was a real strain because he's been sick (cancer, but in remission just weak). 

So I told my ex (lives with us because we have a kid together)that my father & I were making sausage rolls for dinner and I may make some fries and cheese sauce with them since he doesn't like sausage rolls. He has specifically told me he doesn't like my fathers ones. He also apparently has a self diagnosed stomach ulcer & has repeatedly told me he shouldn't eat the sausage rolls just the fries and that he doesn't even like sausage rolls. Fine. More for my father and me especially since I prefer mine the next day. 

So finally I have the fries etc done & he says he may ""have"" (passive aggressive because with him it's always have & need not want) to eat the sausage rolls because he's so hungry. So I just mentioned not to eat a lot of them because they're also lunch for tomorrow (we do little ones and fill up an entire cookie tray of them). So he complains, asking in a tone ""well how many am I allowed to have even though I'm really hungry."" To which I said "" actually, you don't even like them so don't have too many. My father & I actually enjoy them and you don't, you can make yourself something else especially since you keep saying you shouldn't eat these. It's also rude to eat a lot of something you don't even like when you know the other person really likes them, why take that away from them?"" 

He kind of laughed at me & made a big deal about me saying it's ""rude for him to eat"" which wasn't my point.

I have been with my SO for 6 years. We BOTH have a child from a separate relationship (9M for SO, my son is 7M) and 2 girls together. I’m 28F and SO is 32M.

My SO and I starting dating and quickly got married within the year. 

We had his son 9M 50/50 for 3 years. His BM moved away without their son 9M and he was with us for 2 years 100% of the time. She visited once a month for a day. He still paid child support because we couldn’t afford to go back to court to get custody changed. This caused a lot of fights. I have always made more than my SO and I always took care of our house bills. We did not combine our finances because I felt like it didn’t feel like we were in it together at times so therefore I never felt comfortable combining finances.

When we finally went back to court because we could afford it, BM got very upset and took our son 9M and we have only seen him once every 2 weeks. He has changed a lot and he’s not the same kid we had. He is now very rude, lazy, and can be very mean to my son 7M and doesn’t acknowledge our daughters.

This has caused even more fights. My SO has never been a hands on parent UNLESS 9M is with us. I will drop off the kids at daycare/school. I do pick up. I went to school events. I got them home, did dinner, shower, bedtime routines. We both work a 8-5 job so it wasn’t time constraints, he just never did anything. 

I finally got a better paying job and he still is making the same amount when we got together. I am making double what I was making when we first met.

I feel very taken advantage of and I feel like he is holding me back.

I want to purchase a car but he refuses to (and I haven’t done it out of respect) because he wants to pay off his $5000 credit card first.

So the ex comes to pick up the kids this morning. He tells me his parents drove in from out of town without telling anyone except his sister. They called her when they were 6 hours away (they live about 13 hours away) to let her know they’d be arriving and staying at her house that night.

0,"WIBTA if I stop talking to a friend because she turn me down? | I know the title sounds dumb but hear me out.

I met this amazing girl in a class around two years ago, we immediately connected, as friends, but we did. We used to talk every day and we had a lot in common, this was the beginning of something awesome. Now, for some reason she began to make weird comments such as ""I love your eyes"" or ""I don't usually like beard in men, but you look cute"" and a last bomb that said ""If you and I had kids, hopefully they'd get your eyes and my nose"", silly stuff like that. Now, I'm not very bright and I took those comments as hints, so I began to create this romantic scenarios in my head until I fell in love with her badly.

&#x200B;

Fast forwarding 3 months I finally decide to ask her out, on a phonecall and she said yes, but she sounded a little bit insecure, but I just thought she was nervous or something so I didn't give too much thought to it, we hang up and 10 minutes later she texted me asking if I asked her out as friends or as something else, to which I replied that I never thought about it as being friends, and she turned me down and said that she didn't see me as any more than friends.

&#x200B;

So I decide to protect myself, since I was hurt, by distancing myself from her, not as a revenge, not as a ""If we can't be a couple then we can't be friends either!"", hell, I wasn't even mad, I was just hurt and I wanted to heal, since I was very much into this girl. She started to notice that we were not talking as much as we did before, so she asked me if I was okay and I said that I was okay, she then proceeds to ask me if I was mad about what happened and I said that I wasn't, that I was okay. She then starts telling me that I only wanted to spend time with her because I was into her and I never cared about our friendship, but I did, I just started to develop feelings while we were friends. She made me feel guilty for all of this, and I really just wanted to heal, I had no bad intentions in any way.

So anyways, he decide to give our friendship another try, because I thought that she may have been right and that I was being unreasonable by trying to protect myself that way. So now it's been 2 years since that happened, she's been with a guy for more than a year now, I had a relationship that didn't work out, I thought I had moved on, but it seems that I don't.

I noticed though that she started to give me once again these weird comments such as ""You're so handsome"" or ""I want to be your sugar baby"" or even, I told her how I wanted to play piano and she said ""if you do become a good pianist, be sure to marry me"". I'm aware that she's saying those comments as a joke, but even so, they're pretty weird. I don't get this girl, I don't get why she's making those comments, we managed to get our friendship up to this point, but this comments are bringing back these feelings.

1,"AITA for telling a scary story to my girlfriend's little cousin? | Last night my girlfriend was at her house and babysitting her young 5 year old cousin. Her parents and aunt and uncle were out for the night and she invited me over so that we could spend some time together whilst watching out for her cousin. I won't divulge his real name, but let's just call him Timmy. Timmy was actually well behaved throughout the night. He put his own messes away, he politely asked when he wanted something, and he was just an all-around good kid. When it came time to tuck him in, he asked me and my girlfriend to tell him a scary story. My girlfriend's mind was a blank and I didn't have anything to offer, so I just decided to improvise and make something up on the spot.

I looked out the window and saw a streetlight and I got the idea to tell the story of a monster called the ""Bunyin"", a tall demon that disguises itself as streetlights during the day and spies on kids in the neighborhood to see which kids are bad and good. He doesn't do anything to the good kids, but when the bad kids are asleep, he drops the streetlight facade, reaches into their windows and takes them away to his underground lair. Timmy was noticeably creeped out, but I told him that he didn't have anything else to worry about since he was a good kid. We bid him goodnight and we hung out for a little while longer, but then Timmy starts screaming. We rush into his room and he's pointing outside his window...at a streetlight. He's crying and screaming ""BUNYIN! BUNYIN!"" We told him to calm down and that it was just a story, but he wouldn't settle down. My girlfriend told me that it was probably for the best if I left and I agreed.

Well, this morning I got called to my girlfriend's house and her parents and aunt and uncle were waiting for me and they didn't look happy. They asked if I told him a scary story about the Bunyin and I said yes. They told me that the story caused Timmy to flee the house early in the morning and they couldn't find him anywhere nearby. They were about to report him missing when one of their neighbors came by with Timmy in his car and he brought him home when he saw him running down the street. I immediately felt guilty about that part and my girlfriend's uncle was really letting me have it. He starts telling me that it would've been all my fault had Timmy been abducted while running away. I argued that Timmy wanted me to tell him a scary story in the first place, but they didn't want to hear it. They asked me to leave and never come near Timmy again.

Even my girlfriend made me feel like shit about it.

0,"WIBTA: Friend wants to surprise boyfriend with a dog | For clarification, I'd just like to start off by saying I love all animals, especially dogs. I would have my own if I had the time. I also love my friends, the boyfriend came on later but he always seemed like a cool cat and I even helped him a bit get with my friend.

Anyways, my friend hits me up asking if I'd be willing to drive with her to pick up a dog to gift the boyfriend for his 21st birthday. I am rather experienced with long drives so I am done nonetheless. However, she wants to buy a dog to surprise the boyfriend with the dog. They had talked about it, just about what dogs he liked, and he seemed to like labs and german shepherds.

However, I think this is a terrible idea. Both her and her boyfriend are both in school. Her boyfriend is in business school and has internships, while my friend is also in school and works to support herself pretty long hours. She currently has a dog, a french bulldog, but it is perhaps one of the worst-behaved dogs I have ever met in my life. He bites hands whenever anyone reaches on the ground, and you can't even pet him for too long before he starts to snarl. This is because when she first got the dog, her and her sister [who works full time] were just as busy as they are today. That dog does not heel, and the only tidbits of training he really has is peeing somewhat near the peepad when he is home for most of the day and the fact that he can sit and give a high five. They refused to train him any harder because they read somewhere that negative reinforcement with frenchies will get them depressed, but I have another friend with a frenchie that is a very good boy through training.

Now if they get a lab, or even a german shepherd, I know those dogs are highly intelligent, and need constant supervision and training at a young age. I am just worried that the new puppy would suffer the same fate as their french bulldog. My friend says that she would help out with the dog, but it seems like her options to do so remain quite limited. WIBTA if I tell her this is a bad idea?

Regardless of whatever happens, I am more than willing to support my friend wherever, and I will help out wherever needed. In the end, I'll probably be the one driving with her to pick up the dog.",False,False,4,2,3,2,1,3,Care
1,"AITA for adopting a dog with the same name as my daughter? | My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.

My wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.

So I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.

Well, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.

So I basically just learned to keep my mouth shut about my dad. That habit kept up with my romantic life, and I've never had a boyfriend serious enough to introduce to my dad and stepmom until now.

My boyfriend and I were supposed to go visit my dad and stepmom over Easter, but obviously that isn't happening. So we facetimed instead.

0,"WIBTA if I refuse to keep a pet that was gifted to me? | My dog died and I decided I didn’t want to have pets again, at least not any time soon.  I loved that dog but she was really high maintenance and had a lot of issues.  My family and friends knew that I didn’t want another pet, but they all chipped in together to get me a puppy... from a backyard puppy mill.  They kept saying things like “your next dog won’t be like your last one”, and “don’t give up on all animals, they need you and it’s not fair to the ones who have done nothing wrong”, and “you’ll get a new dog and realize how silly you’re being” and other really patronizing things. 

No surprise, this puppy mill doesn’t give refunds on “returns” and so my family and friends would be out the $$ they paid for the dog.  I told them repeatedly I didn’t want a dog and so I feel like their “gift” was really disrespectful, and on top of all of it, reprehensible because it was from an irresponsible breeder.

The dog is currently at my house and has been there for about a week.  My mother in particular has been laying on the guilt thick- that I’m an ahole for not appreciating a gift (one that I will have to look after for 12+ years), that if I get rid of the dog that I’m punishing it for something that isn’t its fault, that I have room at my house for the dog so there’s no reason I can’t keep it, that it’s already bonded with me, etc. She of course finds the idea of taking the dog herself to be a “slap in the face”, and thinks that trying to give it to someone else is disrespectful.  The other friends I’ve talked to about it agree with my mom, stating mostly that it’s not the dog’s fault and it’s not fair to abandon it now that it has a “fur-ever” home.

I picked up my pillow and threw it at away from me, which then hit the wall on the opposite side of my room. (My room is kinda small) With the mouse still on the pillow.

Takes several shots in the morning to wake up and downs several bottles to make it through the day. He’s even turned his best friend on the same path he has.

I \[21F\] just finished school in Dec, so things aren't looking to hot in the job market right now. I have more time on my hands than is probably good for me. So I started helping around the house, cooking, etc. My StepDad is an amazing chef, but he is veggie so I have been learning how to cook his favorite foods. It wasn't intentional, but Carl, Mom, and I have started eating mostly vegetarian meals.  
We also have started going for walks around the area \[since there is no one around for a few miles\] and I have been using the treadmill and weights in the garage. Carl loaned me his old bike and we have been riding around the area. We have two dogs as well, so I take them for walks.  
In the six weeks since I have been here, I have lost about 32 pounds. Carl lost 20+ and my mom \[who doesn't weight herself\] says she went down into her old jeans. Even StepDad has lost some inches.  
The other night, Erika asked to talk with me. She says she feels left out. I don't make time for her and she feels alienated because she isn't veggie with the rest of us. She has to make her own meals \[since she doesn't like what I usually make\] and she is out of shape, so bike riding and hiking are not really her thing.  
I told her I was sorry and we could hang out tomorrow if she wanted. We could watch some TV or play a board game or just talk.

0,"AITA for not letting my wife’s friend and her three kids move in with us |   

Title is the short version, here’s the full story. My wife’s friend has been living in her mom’s house since the mother got married to a new husband and moved to his house, paying part of the mortgage to make it possible to not have to sell. A few months ago, the step-dad became rapidly sick and died. Now that she is without the supplemental income, the mother cannot afford to keep two homes, and will be “selling” the house to her son (wife’s friends brother), and needs to be moved out since he doesn’t want to share a home. When they spoke about this a few months ago, they talked about moving her in with us, even making up a chart of expenses and income (I notice it did not include the friend in any of the income). I honestly did not think anything of this since I really thought this would just be a bad idea that would fall to the wayside like so many others. Come time for the announcement of when she needs to be out by, and they are being serious. I had to tell my wife that I don’t want them moving in, for numerous reasons (I’ll specify below), and she has a meltdown. I ended up having to get family involved just to get her to understand exactly WHY this is a bad idea. My wife, ever the bleeding heart, eventually understands, but is still trying to help out however she can.

Here is where the problems come in, the friend had made absolutely no plans AT ALL to move anywhere else, because they assumed it was settled that they would live in our dining room. I can understand her being upset with me, but to be honest I never said yes to this, I simply humored their ideas (again, I never expected it to come to fruition). I should have shot this down in the beginning, and openly admit fault for having to bring this up closer to crunch time, but I was not looking to start an argument over what I thought to be an imaginary scenario.

As to why I don’t want this to happen, that requires a little bit of backstory. Two years ago we allowed my wife’s cousin to stay with us. It was originally communicated to me that it would only be for a few months and he would be paying us to offset the increase in utilities. That turned into a year-and-a-half and I saw no payment of anything. He occasionally would get groceries, but only what he liked while ignoring our preferences. He was also confrontational, stubborn, disrespectful to my parents, argumentative, and easily manipulated my wife in agreeing with him on anything. The electric bill doubled, the water bill tripled, and the added cost of him living there became such an issue that we were nearly foreclosed on due to not being able to keep up payments. Needless to say, this does not make me want to let anyone else in to mooch off of us. Adding four more bodies to the mix will mean even higher bills. That is only part of if though, and the character limit won’t let me go into detail.

Please, no judgement on the wife. She’s a bleeding heart and easily convinced to make bad choices when someone near her is in distress.",False,False,4,3,2,3,1,3,Care
0,"AITA for refusing to allow my biracial daughter to meet and know her ‘old fashioned’ grandfather? | This is a long story so I’m going to try and condense it way down so as not to bore anybody. 

My wife was black. I am white. She passed away 6 years ago after a drunk driver ran a stoplight. 

When we were together, her father cut her out of his life because she married me. He called me names, but the real problem was the names he called her, incredibly hurtful and demeaning and reduced her to nothing in his mind but a slave master loving traitor. 

He made it clear she was no longer his child. When our daughter was born, he sent an angry flurry of Facebook messages to my wife and called our daughter names I don’t want to repeat and only calmed down after he received an extreme backlash from his community when his posts gained notoriety. 

When she died, he didn’t even bother showing up to the funeral despite me reaching out via various platforms to try and reach him. 

My beautiful daughter is 11 years old now. My wife always made it clear how important it was that my daughter had a sense of black identity, and I have done everything I can do instil that in her. I am incredibly, incredibly close to my mother in law and she has many black and biracial grandchildren that my daughter has grown up with. Without her support I think I would have long succumbed to my grief by now. She has never known, or asked about her grandfather as my MIL and FIL had split up some 30 years prior. 

My wife’s father recently sent me a curt abrupt message telling me that he would like to meet my daughter as he misses my wife. I am filled with a variety of emotions, mostly returned grief over my wife, but I know this much- I don’t want to reconnect with this evil man, nor do I want him to see my daughter.

She’s currently babysitting for 6 month old twins on a regular basis for another family at our church so I trusted that she could handle our kids. When she came over, I showed her the ropes of what my girls liked and she said she could handle it. When I came home, Stella said she had fed the baby a bottle after warming it up in the microwave. I told her not to do that, as the bottle will get too hot. She apologized, said it wouldn’t happen again and left. 

Stella’s mom is a good friend of mine, so we talk regularly. One day, she asked how Stella did babysitting. I said my eldest enjoyed her but I had to reprimand her about the bottle. My friend apologized and I said it was fine, I would trust her again. I was just surprised and hoped she wasn’t doing it with the twins she watched. 

The next time, my husband was taking the baby to an appointment so I asked Stella to watch my eldest. When she came by, she asked if I could not “tattle” on her to her mom. That caught me off guard.

Luckily it’s not as crowded as normal so I get a seat and an empty seat next to me. At the next stop a woman gets on and sits next to me. It seemed to me like she was struggling to sit in a comfortable way and she her stomach was very round and protruding out of her dress. (It was some kind of form-hugging sweater dress so it was fairly noticeable). 

I also should point out that I am 7 months pregnant myself! I thought we had something in common so I smiled at her and said “when are you due?” She then furrows her eyebrows at me and goes “Pardon me?” 

That’s when I thought maybe she took offense because she doesn’t know me so I was like “oh sorry it’s none of my business.” 

That’s when she narrowed her eyes and said in a snappy way “I’m not pregnant.” Obviously I’m mortified but I kind of froze up and didn’t know what to say so I think I just said “oh”. 

She then gets up and walks to the whole other side of the train even though that meant she had to stand until we got to her stop. So clearly my comment really bothered her :/

I am obviously embarrassed now by the whole thing. But I truly didn’t have any ill intent.

0,"AITA for telling my grandma I won't take care of my disabled cousin if she dies? | Background: Me and my two younger sisters were raised by my grandmother. My aunt had a baby who is currently two years old who my grandmother also ended up with custody of. The baby is severely disabled. She's blind, mostly deaf, can't walk or talk, eats through a feeding tube and will likely never develop past the point she's at right now. She's basically an eternal 6 month old. It's a full-time job to take care of her. She's on a very strict feeding and medication schedule and requires monthly visits to a child specialist two hours away.  Me and my fiance have both decided that we don't want children. It's been an ongoing discussion for us since we decided to get married. I just don't want children and don't feel like the motherly type.

Story: Since my grandmother knows I don't want children, she usually makes jokes about watch me end up with the most kids out of my sisters and stupid things like that. Lately, she's been joking about me taking care of the baby if something happens to her. It's usually something like ""Oh Baby, what will you ever do when Cronchy has to take care of you? She hates babies!""

I don't hate babies, I just feel that it's unfair for me to have children if I'm not committed to motherhood. I didn't say anything because I thought she was joking. But the other day she sat me down for a discussion about her life insurance policy. We started discussing the baby. She told me that she was leaving me the house so I would have a stable place to care for the baby. She had not even asked me about taking the baby, and just told me I would have to.

I told her that I'm not really qualified to be taking care of the baby, as she needs a lot of attention and care that I can not give. I also told her that I did not want to be responsible for a small baby with such high needs, seeing as I want to travel and enjoy the married life with my fiance and I'm working on getting my degree. I just wouldn't have the time to give the baby what she needs. I'm just not the right person for the job. I'm also very young still, only 20, and I do not believe in any way shape or form I'm mature enough to have a baby.

I thought my reasons were good reasons for her to find someone better suited to take care of the baby, but she blew up. She started saying how I'm the best person for the job since I'll never have my own children to take up my time and how she doesn't trust anyone in the family besides me to do it. Then she started guilting me saying if I didn't take the baby, then she would just end up in a home and be neglected. Keep in mind, my aunt, the baby's mother is still alive and well, and I fully believe she could take care of the baby if my grandma held her accountable. It's been a few days since our argument and my grandma has been giving me the cold shoulder. She keeps making snide remarks about how if she dies no one will love the baby and no one will take care of her.

No one else does besides her best friend. Winnie has even said she would be president of the itty bitty titty committee. I assumed she was rather proud of her flat chest since she always brings it up.

1,"AITA for ""ruining"" my girlfriend's birthday? | Long post but please hear me out :(

I have a chronic disease that often causes lots of pain. Yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday, and the past couple of days have been pretty bad to put it lightly. The day prior I took her out to eat, took her shopping, and then took her to her favorite little park that has a waterfall. I was trying my best to keep it together, but pain like this is going to show no matter what. I apparently frustrated her because I complained quite a few times about how much pain I was in and with the pace I had to walk (part of the pain right now is in my leg and I have to limp around so I walk pretty slowly). That night I went to bed pretty early as my disease causes me fatigue (and we did quite a bit that day) and that is the only way for me to escape the pain besides drowning myself in painkillers and the like.

The morning of her birthday I slept in again for the same reason, and I know this upset her very much. I didn't wake up until around noon, which meant half of her birthday was already over :(. When I woke up I gave her her gifts (everything she told me she wanted: a new ring, shoes, some makeup and a bouquet of flowers). After that, it took me quite a while to get ready and we didn't end up leaving the apartment until around 2:30 to head to her family's house (when she originally told me she wanted to leave around noon). At her family's house I didn't really talk much and didn't participate in all of the things they were doing because of my pain. 

After all of this we had to head to her grandmother's house as she was leaving for a trip and she wanted us to take care of her dog and watch over the house. While packing my stuff I admittedly snapped on her a little bit as I felt like I was reaching my limit and was having to carry around a couple of pretty heavy things which increased my pain even more. 

This morning she told me that I ""ruined"" her 21st birthday and she feels like I don't care about her. She texted me ""one day...my fucking birthday...that's all I wanted.""

Now in addition to the pain I feel fucking awful. It hurt so bad to hear that I ""ruined"" her 21st birthday and I kind of fell silent after that because I didn't know what to say which just made her more upset with me.

1,"WIBTA if I tell my 37 year old coworker that one of our student staff guessed that she was 44 years old? | So I’m 34 and I work in higher education.  I manage a staff of RAs and there are only 3 people total in my position at this university (it’s a small department).  For some reason, one of my coworkers who is in the same role as me has been comparing herself to me in a negative way recently.  A week or two ago she told me she “looked younger than me” apropos of absolutely nothing.  I just let it go, but happened to be at dinner with my staff a few days after she said that and mentioned in conversation how I only came out when I was around 30; some of them looked surprised because they didn’t think I was even 30 years old yet—they guessed I was around 28.

So I asked them, how old do you think [coworker] is?  And one of them said “44?”  Of course, I decided this wasn’t something I should tell her.  Until this morning.  

She comes in and starts talking to me about stuff and I’m cleaning my glasses and complaining about how the lenses always seem dirty no matter how much I clean them.  She says, “Well it’s because they’re too big for your face and you’re always pushing them up.” (I push them up using the bridge or the edges, but okay whatever.)  And then she starts talking about some fugly frames I should get instead that “go out at the edges” and I was like, yeah those just really aren’t my style.  And she said, “well those frames are just too big for your face and they make you look 45.”

I’m sorry, what?  I replied, “I respectfully disagree, as people usually guess my age around 28 or so.”  Eventually she dropped it and went to her office, but it seems like a pattern of her comparing herself to me to cut me down is forming and if she brings up how she “looks younger than me” or how “old I look” again, I’m tempted to tell her that a student guessed her age at 44 to get her to shut up about it.

My area is in the midst of a snowy winter wonderland that has caused ice sheets over the roads and a ton of snow. Schools all over multiple counties closed on Monday and Tuesday, and they announced a delayed start for Wednesday. All the surrounding districts are closed today, for reference.

Driving carefully, slowly, etc, doing my best. I'm not the most confident driver out there and have next to nothing in snow/ice driving experience being that I got my license in a sunny southern state and have spent all of my adult/driving life in places that don't snow up until this year, when I moved to a place that gets the occasional snow but I was told my year round tires would work fine. 

I called my staff to see how roads are around them, as I know they're closer to the school district. They also had serious concerns as there was ice all over their area as well. Three of them said they were comfortable trying to head in to work and would let me know how it goes. I called my boss and relayed that I was not comfortable driving but that remaining staff could probably handle the job for the day. The gist of my boss's response was that if my staff was willing to go in, I should have more commitment and be willing to drive to work as well. That I'm setting a bad example for staff.

I told her this was stupid as this would draw in other dogs and that she's gonna get attached.

She knew we needed to get the dog tested and vaccines and then keep it in the country for 3 months or it'd be quarantined alone when back in the UK. 

This was set to cost thousands of pounds. Money we don't really have as we've just spent 6 months travelling. We have no jobs secured for our return, so I don't think it's responsible to get a dog even if she has the money to pay for it all.

When my gf noticed, she asked in a very pushy way until I told her where it was from. Since then, she has been suggesting I look at scar removal and also acted more distant. Just recently, my best friend (who happens to be the bf of my gf's best friend) came and told me that my gf told his gf about my scar and that she was weirded out by how I ""cannibalized"" myself.  

That's okay, she has the right to be weirded out, even if it hurts, but that she went and told someone about what it was from made me furious. I went home to ask her what exactly she said. Turns out I was lucky enough that she left out the backstory, but goddamn, I told her it was personal (my best friend knows about the scar, but not how I got it).

Her regular lunch is a soda and a store bought sandwich, which are both quite expensive in our country. Tap water and home made food would probably be one tenth of the price.
We work together every other Saturday, but lately there's only been need for one of us to work. Each time she has asked if it's OK that she's the one to work, cause she needs the money. That's fine with me, but I do get annoyed when I hear her complaining about how she can't afford to take a single day off when I see how she spends her money. I don't know anything other than the lunch, but just there she could probably save enough to take one day off monthly. I mostly feel bad for her daughter.

I told her that if she wants to try to save some money, she could make her own sandwiches at home that are just as good and a lot cheaper, and told her what I usually buy to make mine. I also said that I save a lot by just drinking tap water. She didn't call me an asshole, but she did seem quite offended and just said that she knows very well what she can and can't afford to spend her own money on.

0,"AITA for checking on my elderly neighbor? | I live in an apartment building with my girlfriend and I have a neighbor across the hall that I'm friendly with.  

I dont really know her that well but we do say hi when we see each other.
One thing I do know about her is that she has a son (late 40's?) and a granddaughter (14?) who seems very intelligent just based off having small conversations with her when she sees me with my dog.
The son, however, has given me and my girlfriend weird vibes.  I've never spoken to him but I did hear him tell his mom to shut the fuck up one time.

Anyways, here's what happened last night.  It was around 11 pm and I heard a bunch of loud bangs.  Like heavy enough that it woke my gf up.  No sound came after so I chalked it up to someone falling in their apartment.
5 minutes later I hear another big bang and a quick scream.  I go outside in the hallway to listen and I hear nothing so I walk up to the level above and listen and nothing.  All of a sudden some arguing starts up from somewhere on my floor so I go down to my floor and listen and  I hear another loud bang and I hear my neighbor telling someone to please calm down.
I didnt even think and I knocked on her door.  She answers hiding behind the door and I asked if she was ok and she said yes but it seemed odd. All of a sudden the son comes running to the door laughing saying everything is ok blah blah but I didnt buy it and I cut him off without even looking at him and asked her again "" are you sure you're ok?"" And she said yes once again.
Now I'm in just my boxers, I'm a big guy (6'3, 240 lbs) and I have a lot of tattoos on my arms and torso so I was TRYING to be as intimidating as possible when I looked her in the eyes and said "" if you have any problems, I'm here"" and then I went back to my apartment.

So at this point, I pretty much assume this guy has/is abusing his mom or granddaughter.
Fast forward to today and my neighbor knocked on my door to explain that her son and granddaughter were playing fighting etc and the story makes complete sense   I apologize for being nosey and she said thank you for being a good neighbor.

0,"AITA for helping with my nieces but refusing to help with my severely disabled nephew? | Throwaway. Context needed.

I'm a childfree (by choice) woman in my mid twenties. My sister is 10 years my senior, so mid thirties. She has two adorable daughters, aged 9 and 7. I often babysit them and I am planning to help them financialy with their college funds, as their parents cannot provide for them. Why? Because of my nephew (5).

Something went wrong with my sister's third pregnancy. The child was going to be born extremely disabled. We are talking no sight, no hearing, no mobility, epilepsy, would stay on the mental level of a newborn. Doctors strongly recommended ending the pregnancy. The whole family - me, my parents, our younger brother, everyone - felt terrible for her, but we also advised her to end it. Well, my sister shocked us all when she refused abortion and said, I quote: ""God makes no mistakes. God will provide for our son."" 

So, my nephew was born - it was as bad as predicted, perhaps even worse. He is bedridden, blind, doesn't react to anything, not even touch. Moves only in uncoordinated spasms, has strong seizures. Both my sister and her husband had to quit their jobs to step up as 24/7 nannies/nurses (one takes over when the other sleeps). They did some courses for nursing, bought home equipment for their son. Right now all their money and savings are going to their son's treatment - I'm not sure how much longer they will be able to continue. This is why I want to pay for the college for the nieces in the future - their funds were used to help the nephew. 

Well, here comes the AITA part. I still babysit my nieces. I do however absolutely refuse to have anything to do with my nephew. I am no nurse. You can't let your eyes off him since his spasms can turn into seizures in a moment. I now not only babysit my nieces, I often have them over on weekends and we go on trips, because in their household, they get ignored because the parents are busy with their brother. 

I did something I know I am an asshole for and don't seek judgement - when my sister confronted me about ""spoiling"" her daughters and ignoring her son, she told me that I'm an asshole for not caring about my family. I flipped and told her that she said that ""God will provide for her son"", so why is she bothering me? I know this comment was uncalled for (her husband then told me off since as a childfree woman I can't ever understand the parents' love for their children). I do however wonder if I am being an asshole for treating my nieces to nice things while absolutely refusing to even spend a minute alone with my nephew. I'm pretty sure the college funds are the only reason why my sister even lets me hang around with the nieces anymore.

However, the evening before seeing the doctor  (yesterday), I had an early miscarriage. I got a check up anyway and the doctor confirmed this and said it can take up to a week to be back to normal. While I am emotionally ok (tbh I am a bit reliefed as I did not want a child & definitely learned a lesson to step up my protection game ) I am bleeding and in pain and I communicated this to my partner. Yesterday night after it started he was very caring, made tea etc.

Today, he was at work which was followed  by a corporate event in the evening. I told him to go ahead and that I would be fine. And I was, I even went out for a bite. As the evening went on I got worse pain and asked him when he would be back to which he first replied 10/11pm and then midnight. I did not want to annoy him and figured another hour would be fine. Closer to 12, I got again worse and I texted him to come back soon as I wasn't well. He did receive but not see the text and then his phone was off when I tried to call him. At this point I was sobbing, also because I really had no one to call.

Around 4 am he came back drunk-ish and said he was at his colleagues/friends house and that his phone had run out of battery. He was a bit apologetic ("" sorry you had to go through this"") but I feel, given my situation, he should have cut the social drinking part of the event short by default and if not that, at least make sure to check on me.

0,"AITA for threatening to cut my mom off if she has another kid? | My parents and I used to be decently close growing up. I (21F) had a pretty normal childhood up until they got divorced when I was 14, which was the result of my dad cheating on top of struggling with alcoholism. My mom (45F) didn’t handle it well at all. She immediately jumped into online dating and shut me out despite the fact that I was really hurting at the time. The man she ended up meeting is who she’s married to today.

My dad, who I don't talk to outside of the typical 'happy birthday' text, ended up having a kid with his new wife two years later while in the meantime, my mom ended up developing symptoms of borderline personality disorder. She clearly is unstable and despite being a nurse doesn’t believe in seeking therapy or additional treatment. For example, my stepdad watched a movie without her and it showed up on their cable bill so she cried hysterically and accused him of cheating/not caring about her for taking time to himself. 

Out of the blue, my mom announces that she wants to adopt a 4 to 5 year old child. My stepdad is also on board with this. I believe she wants to choose adoption because my brother and I are both over 18 now and she wants to lessen the age difference. I also think she believes it’ll be easier. She’s not understanding the challenges associated with adopting a child, and due to the amount of conflict she creates in her own home as well as her refusal to seek help, I don’t believe this is a good idea for her or the child.

I’m also frustrated because my mom and I have a rocky relationship already. I feel no attachment to her as a parent since I practically raised myself and despite how I’ve begged her to go to family therapy with me, she’s refused. I was an unplanned pregnancy, and I think she resents me for that in some way.

He had posted about something that happened to him recently and the page allowed for comments so I went down to see what everyone else thought of his post. He's one of those pastors who likes to travel to small town churches and guest-speak. A lot of the comments were anonymous but a few of them had accounts with photos. One of them, we'll call her ""Betty"" had commented praising the pastor for his post, mentioned that they had met when he preached at her church and she felt like they had a connection and she wanted to speak to him and reconnect. Betty's profile picture and the general tone of her comment gave me the idea that she might be elderly. Based on her photo, she seemed like she was at least 70/75. In her comment she included her hometown, her church, her first and last name, and her cellphone number.

I've seen so many people post their number online where anyone can see it, especially Facebook. Just last week I saw three, ""lost my cellphone, got a new one, let me know your number!"" posts and in the comments were several phone numbers. These are all pages with no privacy settings, anyone can see them.

Anyway, I noticed a lot of trolls in the comments on the pastor's page saying some pretty awful things, commenting mean things to other commenters and I got a little worried that one of them might send ""Betty"" some nasty texts. I've been doxxed before and had some truly terrible things sent to my phone that resulted in me having to get a new number.

0,"AITA for being upset about the way my birthday turned out? | Obligatory this did not happen recently.

My birthday is a week before Christmas. I have a twin and an emotionally distant/inactive family. So my birthday has been mostly ignored my entire life.

My boyfriend thinks that’s awful. His family does huge birthday parties and dinners and cakes – the whole nine yards. He and his mom were horrified that my mom didn’t even call on my big day.

Last year, my actual birthday fell on the same day as BF’s family Christmas party. That’s fine and important, so we decided to do my birthday 1 day early.

My BF is loving and sweet, but he sucks at time management. He’s always showing up hours late to my house when I have dinner ready for him, making me wait 30 minutes while he fiddles with something on the way out the door, etc.

The day of my “pre birthday,” we planned to spend the day together –hiking and grabbing cocktails, then getting a nice dinner.

BF got distracted by something in the garage that had been broken for 5+ years. He decided to start working on it while I waited for him upstairs. Every so often, I checked in with him and he always said he was almost done.

Fast forward 8 hours. It’s 7pm. I’m starving and I’ve been alone all day waiting. He finally comes up and seems confused that I’m upset. The entire day is basically wasted, and to top it off, he never made reservations for dinner, so we end up having to try 3 different places and finally get seated around 8:30pm.

I was not pleased. He didn’t understand. The dinner was expensive and the waitress brought a scoop of ice cream to the table, so he was dumbfounded that I was irritated. He said because it wasn’t technically my birthday until the next day, it wasn’t a big deal we didn’t end up doing anything fun.

Next day was his family’s xmas party, so I spent my whole birthday watching other people get presents. His grandparents did give me a puzzle, which was really sweet of them. Still, call me a princess, but it’s not that fun to watch BF receive $1,000+ in gifts from 10 family members on my own birthday.

I cried in the car on the way home. I wasn’t mad, per se. It’s just that he and his mom had promised for months that my birthday would be special, that they would make up for the lifetime of neglect I’d had with my family, and then when the day actually came, it was the usual letdown.

Late that night, BF gifted me an expensive watch. His POV was – “See? I got you something nice, don’t you feel silly for being upset?”

He wasn’t trying to be demeaning. He really was just trying to say, see, it’s not all bad, it’s okay. And I think he was disappointed that I wasn’t giddy just because I got an expensive gift. What I really wanted was a special day with him.

We don’t talk about it anymore, and we’re in a great place, but I still think about it. I did get a birthday dinner and I did get a fancy watch… but I still feel like my time and priorities were disrespected. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,3,Care

0,"AITA for Telling My Friend I Didnt Like Her Anymore? | I (18f) am a senior in a small town high school. I met my friend (19f) eight years ago, and we have had a rocky friendship to say the least. let's call my friend Dee. Dee had a habit of giving me the silent treatment if I did something wrong in her eyes, but not just any normal silent treatment. Her treatments would last for six months up to a year where essentially, she ignored all of my attempts to make amends with her. 

Dee rode my bus to and from school, and we soon became friends. In my seventh year, the first incident happened. I sat in her seat on the bus. Two boys had sat in my regular seat that day, and hers was the only one that was closest to the back of the bus at the time. I offered her a seat with me, but she refused and moved farther up to sit alone. After that incident, she didnt speak to me for the rest of the school year and into the next. I had tried to appologize numerous times, Only when I had begun to give up did she claim she had forgotten why she was even angry with me. 

The most recent silent treatment had been over the fact that I had asked her not to take my phone. She would pickpocket my phone off of me at some point in the day and photobomb herself and leave my phone on until it died. One particular day my dad tried to call me 7 times. This was the day my sister got into a nearly fatal ATV crash. 

I guess in that most recent year of silence she changed more as a person than I imagined. She seemed nice enough still, but by that point I did not care for her friendship as much as I used to. Soon, she became entirely insufferable to me. At one point, after I had confided my deepest thoughts, as she often did with me, she told me that it ""wasnt her problem"". In my mind, her problems were mine because I wanted to help her grow and be happy in life. The fact that she would even consider saying something like this to me told me that she did not care for me or my feelings.

 She would purposefully try to make me angry because she thought it was ""entertaining"" to see me seethe. She would annoy and anger me to the point of nearly psychotic laughter, and then tell me, ""I love making you mad, you act so tough!"". The fact that she was causing me distress and laughing about it told me that all she cared about was my entertainment value.

&#x200B;

  I should give some backstory to this first, my mother wasn't the best person, she acted like she loved me sometimes, but a lot of the time she would be quite abusive in the emotional sense. For example, when I was learning how to drive she would constantly make comments about how I was purposely trying to harm and kill both her and my sister by purposely trying to crash the car. Not only that, but she would constantly tell me how terrible of a person I am, how I was compliant with the ""people"" trying to ""get"" her, and she would use that as an excuse to punish me severely for weeks at a time. There's more, but I have trouble addressing this stuff. 

&#x200B;

  Eventually, I broke down and couldn't take it anymore. I wanted away from her as much as possible. I called my dad, told him I wanted to move in with him and then proceeded to tell my mother the same. Instead of becoming angry, she tried everything she could to keep me from leaving (preparing my favorite meals every day, tried to enroll me in a new high school, begged me to not pack my things, etc. Everything but apologize for how she treated me). I ended up agreeing to call every day while I lived with my dad, but this didn't last long. While texting with my sister, I ended up learning that it was my mother pretending to be my sister. After this I was done, I called my mother, told her off and then ended by telling her I wanted nothing to do with her anymore. I blocked her number and I thought that was that.

  But as of recently, my mother has been going to therapy and receiving medication for bipolar disorder. I keep being told that she's doing better and that I should reach out and try to reconnect, if not for her sake, for my sister's and my grandfather's sake (I can't see them as much because of my mother and my grandfather is quite old and likely doesn't have many years left.) But I want nothing to do with her anymore, she betrayed my trust on several occasions as well as gave me longstanding problems with depression. But I feel a little conflicted, I feel as if I'm the asshole for not giving her a second chance, or at least not having some relationship with her so I could spend more time with my sister and grandfather, but yet I'm still firm on my decision to not want to have anything to do with her.

0,"WIBTA if I got a nose job even though my daughter has the same nose? | I have my dad's family's nose, which is a giant, crooked beak. It isn't like a nice big aquiline nose or anything, it's just overly large and has a huge bump on the bridge like a retired prizefighter. As you can tell from how I talk about it, I've always hated it.

I've been saving up for a nose job since I graduated college 10 years ago, but with our wedding, buying a house, and having our daughter, it fell to the wayside. Now, I can finally safely afford to have it fixed, and I feel that it's perfect timing because we are relocating at the end of the year for my husband's job.

The problem is that my six year old daughter has my nose. She was born with it, and thankfully isn't being teased about it yet (she just started first grade). My husband was always supportive of me getting my nose fixed, but now both he and my sister (who, I should add, got my mom's tiny nose) think I'd be setting a bad example for my daughter and implying that HER nose is ugly.

I have lived my life with this nose; I know my daughter will be teased for it and will know it isn't a 'pretty' nose no matter what I do or say. I think showing her there's a way out of it would be more beneficial if she's anything like me. Also, I think she's too young to really grasp what would be happening.

Anyways, aside from the noise I have other issues with them that I don’t bring up because as far as roommates go they’re pretty good. However, this usually builds up some tension on my end and my way of dealing with it is getting “roasty” with them. Yesterday after spending all day with them and quite frankly, exhausted I began to get a little mean. When I say mean I mean I was playfully joking around with them and “roasting”. Nobody was getting hurt hurt. One of my roommates was sewing a pair of pants and I asked where she learned to sew. She said her mom taught her. I made a snarky comment and said “Well didn’t you grow up with a stepford wife”. My roommate then went off and said “I’m sorry my mom gave up her dream job to raise 3 kids so my dad could work. Just because your mom is bad at her job doesn’t mean my mom is.” My mother is the only source of income in my household and I have a terrible relationship with my parents.

I have this one really clingy ""friend"" I guess that is 16/F and a high school junior. She messages me about everything and anything and although it annoyed me, I decided to listen to her because she needed a friend I guess. I mean, she has other friends but I guess they're not what she needs emotionally. She will rant to me about everything and anything, including her trauma-inducing Asian parents, and has broken down during a conversation with me through text when she didn't get chosen as a captain for the swim team. 

I only talked to her at first because I liked her sense of humor, to an extent, but all she does is just send me pointless Anaconda memes and roast this one Spanish teacher we both had.

I don't have time for pointless, useless and overly emotional conversations except for with my GF and another close male friend, who intends to attend MIT next year as a math and CS major (we are both analytical and have a lot in common). 

I finally cracked and wrote a whole Tumblr post about how much she was exhausting me, how our conversations were pointless and aggravating and how I was so done with her.

My grandma died recently, and I was really close with her, my dad is fairly trauma inducing too, and I'm still hurting over my ex-GF cheating on me with another guy in FRONT of me.

It was a shotgun wedding on account of my older sister. When I was a kid they'd argue constantly and dad pretty much would live with us for a year, move out for a year, move back in for a year, move back out for a year, and every time they'd say it was over, they were getting divorced, they couldn't make it work, and then dad would move back in and things would resume. They'd also try and bring me and my sister into arguments and get us to say whose side we were on. I moved out as soon as I reached 18 because I was just so tired of hearing them fight all the time. They made it clear they were only together for me and my sister, and we told them at one point that they could split up with no hard feelings from us, but they didn't believe us and thought we were ""putting on a brave face"" for their sake so they stayed together. They refuse to see a marriage counselor or any sort of therapist, separate or together, as they feel it's a waste of time, money, and energy.

My son is 7 years old. I live within 90 minutes of my parents' house, and after my son's father left they offered to help me out with childcare.  I refused initially as he was in preschool so he had someone to go to, but when the school holidays rolled around I had to ask them for some help. One of the first times he was with them for the day (he was 3 or 4 at this point) he came home and told me they'd spent the day fighting, tried to make him pick a side, and he didn't want to go back. I told both of them that spending the day yelling at each other in front of him and dragging him into their fight was unacceptable. They tried to pull my sister into the argument and she offered to watch my son rather than send him back there.

On Saturday around 10 I got a call asking me to come into work for a meeting at 12. I asked my sister if she could watch my son but it was too short notice. I called my parents and asked if they could meet me at my town center, and just watch him for a couple hours and take him to the beach or round the shops. They agreed. I was gone for approx 1hr30 and in that time they had an argument. My son said there was no yelling but they'd tried to make him pick sides again.

I gave it a lot of thought and rang them today and told them that they could only see my son from here on out if they were apart, and if they ever tried to pull him into an argument again they wouldn't be allowed to see either of us.

I feel justified because at the end of the day I'm talking about my relationship with my parents and my son, however in the conversation they did make some valid points, including that my son loves them and wants to see them, they've been together 3 decades, and my dad has a sight issue that means it's not safe for him to drive after dark so he can't come alone until summer.

1,"AITA for putting my 9yo on a diet and 'emotionally damaging' her? | Ex (32f) and I (34m) have a 9yo daughter 'M'.
We broke up when M was 5 and I moved away, I would see M in breaks and speak on the phone so I was as involved as I could be.

Last year I move back. I now have her alternate weeks.

I had noticed M starting to put on weight. She's not obese but seeing her in person, I've noticed she has a belly which hangs over her waistband, and she wears 12-13 clothes despite being only 9. 

I spoke to ex and she got defensive, saying that M ate what she eats (ex is skinny and healthy) and has a sport she goes to twice a week. I asked about portion sizes and other exercise (twice a week for 90mins isn't that much) I was trying to stay friendly but ex shut me down.

I know weight gets harder to lose the older you get so I decided to keep a close eye and do what I could on her weeks with me. 

I did not put her on a crash diet but I did start using a portion control plate and packing lean lunches instead of letting her buy her food. (Carrot sticks, yogurt, flavoured steamed chicken breast etc.) M complained at first but then seemed fine with this. 

I also took her to the gym with me 4 times a week, my gym have parent and child classes.

The only thing I said to M about it is that we were working to set her up for the future being physically fit and mindful of what she eats.

So last week a kid is having a birthday and the parents are taking a small group to the movies and after to sleepover. The parents asked that everyone send their kid with their own snack and then the parents would buy popcorn on top to share.

I'm trying to show my kid that snacks can be healthy, so I sent her with a bag of veggie sticks and hummus. She made a little fuss about not getting candy but seemed fine.

I dropped her off and ex was gonna pick her up. Next day ex texts. I head over and ex isnt happy, M is upset and won't look at me.
Apparently when they were sat at waiting for the movie kids started comparing snacks. M told the other kids that they were gonna get fat and unhealthy bc their parents gave them those snacks. She said she had to eat the veggies so she could lose weight, and she wasn't allowed any popcorn (I never said this).
Then at their house after they ordered pizza for the kids M refused to eat saying she was gonna get fat. The parents called ex and she came and got her.

M was crying saying that she was scared if she ate anything bad she'd put on weight and everyone would hate her. She told ex about our diet and gym. I hadn't because it was my weeks and why should I divulge all our plans.

Ex ranted saying M always came home tired and refusing to eat. She blames me for giving M a complex when she was healthy and active. I said if she was healthy she wouldn't have a belly and be bigger than other girls. I said that at least I cared about what the girl puts in her mouth and she said M was happier before I moved back. Now ex is telling me she won't send her back to me if I don't stop 'emotionally damaging' her.

She's struggled with depression all her life and at this point in time it's gotten near impossible to function. I've been helping her out immensely-she moved back in, I pay for her living, and she's working on taking care of herself and working to a place where she can handle things like other people and a job again, while getting on medication for her depression. It's going well, she's working hard to get more stable, and it feels like starting over again as a mother-I've always loved the baby stage best.

Since this my biological daughter has become bitchy and unpleasant. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she thought it was ""fucked up"" that I opted out of parenting both my children, sort of blaming me for their mental health, and then I play mother of the year for a baby that isn't mine. I let it go because to an extent I see her point. I was a young, single, working mother, so I didn't spend much time with either of my children. I wasn't the most mature or best equipped to handle them like I am now. I figured she would get over it if I let her vent.

She didn't get any happier or nicer, so I asked again. And again. And she kept complaining about her *terrible* childhood and how awful I was. Eventually I got sick of it and told her the reality-she was a problem child and I was in over my head trying to do my best. I had to handle her underage drinking, drug use, frequent arrests, and an expulsion and she never made it easy. She said that she hoped her sister got her act together before my grandchild gets old enough that I lose interest. That was my last straw and I told her to stop talking to me until she can be respectful and polite.

My husband (her step-father) has refused to take my side, going so far as to say I'm being disrespectful and I have to acknowledge I was a bad mom once. I feel like everyone is ganging up on me, and the only people who aren't mad at me are my adopted daughter and grandson.

In January I (27F) gave birth to my first baby, a lovely boy, the first grandchild of my side and the first boy on my husband family.


My initial plan was only my husband (31M) could be with me during the birth and family could come and await or be called when the baby arrives. Both of our parents decided to come.


After 10 hours the birth was more hard them the expected, I was tired, scared, literally crying. So I gave up and asked my husband to call my mom, I just fell like I needed her there. Not much later the baby was born. I was holding my mom's hand so hard that one of her fingers broke.


In the other day when she came visit me and the baby she was pretty cold with me but I was too happy to give attention to it. But after that I noticed I was receiving the cold treatment in every single family event. When I asked what was the problem she simple said ""nothing"" or ""I don't know what you are talking about"".


During this time for obvious reasons I am not permitting any visitors, but I offered my MIL TO Facetime with her so she can see the baby, this have been working fine, until yesterday. My mom is staying with us, my father is a first responder and was afraid of infect my mom, she have asthma.

(She normally always bargain more time)

This morning I was lot more inpatient, I called her:

Me - what is the problem and don't say nothing.

MIL - you really didn't found the problem?

Me - no, I can't read your mind, you don't say it, how am I suppose to know?

MIL - your favoritism over your mom is the problem

Me - what are you even talking about?

MIL - she was with you when the baby born and I couldn't, she can visit the baby and I can't.

Me - she was not visiting, she is staying here.

MIL - Why you didn't told me?

Me - because I don't need to tell you when we have guests. You have treated me so bad because I didn't let you in while I was giving birth? By the love of God. I was vulnerable, in pain, and naked, I didn't wanted no one in there, she only entered because I was scared and really needed her!

MIL - I was there for all my grandchildren birth, you make me break the tradition

Me - I was in pain and trying to push a baby out of my body! You know what I am tired of this, you can get over this or pass the rest of your life with that crap attitude.

She recently lost about 15 lbs which was awesome but she likely gained it all back and is right where she started again because of our eating habits these past few weeks.

We’ve been on vacation so we’ve been eating like absolute shit. She expressed that she was feeling like she had gained weight and was visibly upset by it. She was pinching her stomach and just beating herself up about how “obese” she looked. She asked me if she looked bigger and I responded that she looked bloated but it was probably her period, and I had been eating like shit too so I probably gained just as much weight.

She broke down crying and spent an hour in the bathroom and now she thinks I hate her body and think she’s fat. I was 1) being honest and telling her what she looked like and 2) not saying she was fat or that I didn’t love her body so idk where she got that from?

It’s flu season and I know I won’t be able to watch all 20 people all night to make sure everyone washes their hands before holding the baby and most importantly doesn’t kiss the baby. Plus I know the poor little thing is going to be passed around all night. 

The baby won’t get shots until 6 weeks which is when I’d feel more comfortable taking her out.

I had mentioned that I may not attended the Christmas party to some family members and was met with a lot of negativity. My mom telling me she took my brother out when he was only a week old & he turned out fine. And others upset that they won’t get to to meet the baby and that I’m basically overreacting.

Me and my ex split a few years ago after he left me for someone else. Despite the infidelity we kept it civil for the most part. He is still with the women he left me for. We have two children together.

I have since moved on and have been living with someone for over a year now. Our relationship is very serious with talks of marriage and children. I have the children 95% of the time, their dad maybe has them one night every other week at a push. 

Obviously my partner sees the children a lot. He is great with them. He has formed amazing bonds with them both. He helps with the school run, home work etc. The children know he isn't a replacement dad - he is a bonus parent. Someone extra to love them like me and their dad. 

A couple of weeks ago my youngest asked what she can call him. We had a conversation with her and agreed she can call him whatever she feels comfortable with but that although my partner loves them like they are his own - he isn't their dad. She decided that he is like a dad to her and she now has two dad's so started calling him daddy. I also told her that the same applies to her dad's girlfriend and they can call her what they are comfortable with. 

The children came back from their dads today and informed us that their dad has told them they aren't allowed to call my partner daddy anymore as it hurts his feelings. My ex had ample chance to talk to me and address this but didn't. He let the children mention it.

She was hosting a party at our house on Saturday. It was honestly more of a work event and she was super excited about it because she wanted it be our first ""mature"" party (meaning their were cocktails/wine as opposed to a keg, little sandwiches as opposed to pizza and our new hot tub was off limits so no bikinis either...I was joking with her that it sounded like the ""no-fun-arty"" which she found mildly amusing the first time I said it but the next 10000, not so much). 

So she got home Friday and worked until almost 2AM preparing and storing all the food she wanted to serve. There was some sort of work emergency at 7AM so she had to go in and I didn't even realize she was gone until I woke up at about 10. She texted me at like 5 and said she was having the most awful day ever and said she was thinking about cancelling the party. I told her that I would help in whatever way I could. She said it would be awesome if I cleaned up. 

I know me and my wife have very different cleaning standards but I very honestly did the best I could. I cleaned up all our mail that accumulates, cleaned the bathroom to what I thought was spotless, wiped down the kitchen and even started to warm up all the food she prepared. 

She ended up getting home at 6:45 and jumped right in the shower. Guests started showing up at 7 and it didn't even occur to me that I was still wearing my dirty cleaning clothes as I was greeting and chatting with her guests.  

She came out and in a stern ""mom voice"" she demanded to talk to me in the bed room. She laid into me like no one's business. I mean a brief laundry list of all my offenses: 

1. not wearing appropriate clothes. She didn't give me credit that I had been cleaning right until 7 because:

2. There was dog hair apparently everywhere, including the couch and there were piles of where it builds up next to the furniture. I had completely forgot to vacuum and everyone was getting dog hair on their clothes from sitting on the couch. 

3. I guess I missed some huge pee spots on the toilet.

4. I had missed her text that I needed to go get ice. 

5. I guess instead of warming up these salmon/cream cheese wheels I was just supposed to take them out but I put them in the oven and ruined them. 

6. and she reminded me of no-fun-arty.

Even with all that, the party went off just fine but it's Wednesday now and she is still made at me and says that my behavior and the jokes in the weeks leading up to the party show that I didn't even care how much it meant to her and my behavior that day makes her think I don't even care about her.

1,"AITA for setting up a blind date based on my friend’s fetish? | This happened in January, but I’ve had plenty of free time to ruminate these past few weeks. Needless to say it’s not been good. 

The background on my situation is this: I (21M) am close friends with “Cole” (21M). We’ve known each other for ten years, and we basically know each other’s weirdest shit. My other friend, “Taylor” (20F), I met through a mutual hobby. She’s a very sweet and fun girl, and you’re just happy when you’re around her. She hasn’t had much luck dating, though, because she’s pretty large (maybe like 250-300 lbs). 

Well, Cole confided a few years ago that he has a BBW fetish. He’s dated a few normal size girls, but for whatever reason, he hasn’t been able to land a BBW.

I saw a win-win, and I decided to set them up. Taylor was reluctant, so I told her that Cole was also overweight and his social media pics were old. I assured her that he would like her. I didn’t tell her about the fetish because I didn’t want to “expose” Cole about something so personal. Cole is not overweight.

Well, Cole apparently let his fetish slip during their date (they went to Dunkin), by bringing up his interest in the feeder fetish. She got very upset, blocked Cole on all socials, and has been cold to me since. We haven’t seen each other in person though, because of certain current events.

I hadn't seen him in probably 8 plus weeks, meanwhile I see my girlfriend everyday. So when he asked me to hang out, I was excited, because he got off work early. And this was probably the one time in I don't know how long that I would be able to see him until I don't know when. I texted my girlfriend this (her knowing my situation and how much I miss my best friend). I thought she would be supportive and tell me to see him. But she just got upset and gave me the cold shoulder. When it sounded like it was becoming a problem, I said to forget it, and I would come in, but she just got more and more irritated.

0,"AITA for my reaction to my partner calling my photo ugly? | This just happened a few minutes ago and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or not. 

For the past few years, I’ve avoided having my picture taken by others because of insecurities. I just deleted my entire Facebook because my boyfriend’s family tagged me in an unflattering photo on Facebook over the holidays. I don’t think I’m ugly or unattractive, I just believe I’m not photogenic at all. On the rare occasions I actually do look good in photos, I usually use those as profile pictures for years until another good one happens!

Today, I went to renew my driver’s license. I turned 21 last year but I wasn’t ready to take the new photo for my ID until just recently. Anxious, I woke up very early today to do my hair nicely, put on makeup, etc. 

Long story short, I’m actually VERY pleased with how the photo turned out! I sent a picture of it to my parents and waited until my boyfriend came home to show him. Not feeling ugly in my ID photo may seem trivial to some people, but it was something that mattered to me. 

When I showed it to him, he took it and looked at it for a while, then said, “Oh, wow! This is such a bad photo of you!”

I asked him if he was joking and he replied, “No, you look like a man. An old man. This is ugly.” He handed it back to me and asked, “you don’t see it? Look, you look like a man!”

Shocked, I told him that what he said was really rude.  He knows how I feel about having my picture taken. 

He stood up and stormed off. I asked him how he had the audacity to get mad at me because I got offended by what he said. 

His response was, “ I didn’t necessarily call you ugly, just the picture.”

I told him, regardless, it’s still rude and it hurt my feelings. He stormed off again, claiming that I was trying to start an argument. 

Changing topics, I reminded him he forgot to turn the hallway light off (which happens every day). He said, “Stop talking to me like you’re somebody. You’re not anybody.”
 
He mumbled more rude stuff but I’m not 100% sure what he said so I won’t include it. Since then, I’ve been staring at the photo, feeling more and more insecure the longer I look at it. 

This isn’t one of those post where I’m seeking validation. I genuinely want to know if/how I’m TA for telling him, verbatim, “What the hell? That was a really rude thing to say to me.” Was I overreacting for being hurt over his comments?

1,"AITA for going off on my GF when she called me a bad pet owner? | So to start off my girlfriend and I share a dog. I work at a police department and saved him from the pound as a puppy despite living in a no-pets property. I pay for his food, vet bills, and half of his toys and equipment like leashes.

My girlfriend is in college and works part time. I pay for her meals when we are together, pay for gas, tutor her, and even do some of her schoolwork for her and teach her the concepts afterwards because she procrastinates a lot. In return, she takes care of our dog when she’s not in school, cleans my place up on occasion, and promises that she’ll get a good job when she’s out of school so I can work on my business and look into becoming an EMT (lower pay than my current job). We live separately.

This morning, following a 12 hour shift of bullshit and spring breakers,I stayed up for her to stop by and drop off Fido on her way to school. I called her on the way over and at some point she said something about she wanted to sell our dog yesterday. I asked why and she said to give it a better home than what I provide, and said she only refused to sell him because she (correctly) thought I’d be pissed. She then said she thought I was a bad dog owner. I exploded.

Every day Fido gets at least 20 minutes of play time no matter how tired or busy I am. He often gets more. Up until today, he had the whole yard to run in freely and was visited daily by my niece while I sleep in addition to our daily 20 minutes of play/walkies. He is going to have to spend some time in his 5x10 kennel the next few days as a pool is being put in and he cannot roam freely in the dig site without being supervised, and she cited this and the fact that I don’t take him to the dog park as reasons why I’m a bad owner. Apparently the dog park is leagues better for a dog’s mental health than walking, even if you’re nocturnal and can only go at times no other dogs are there. She also doesn’t accept the fact that I walk him or play with him daily despite the fact she’s never here to see it.

I was triggered to say the least. I brought up the tutoring, the money I give her, called her an ungrateful smartass, everything in the book. I said something along the lines of “How can you even say that to me right now without realizing what a huge piece of shit it makes you”. She at some point said she didn’t care what I thought and now we’re not talking to each other.

We’re generally happy together but this is a recurring argument (she does not think I ever spend time with him for some reason) that I’m looking to put to rest. 

Am I the Asshole for going off on her so harshly?

Also sorry for the huge wall of text.

To give you the much needed context, this has started about 6 years ago and it is still ongoing.

My parents have gotten divorced when I was 12 but it didn’t really affect me that much. My father is a great guy and he has always supported me in every single way, the same goes for my mother.

Now the thing about my mother is that she really couldn’t get over it, and still hasn’t. She got this amazing idea of having me emotionally blackmailing my father and coercing him into returning back home. 
She started telling me to tell him things like “Can you please return home for me? I want my family back yada-yada-yada...” and I actually did for a while. She managed to convince my 12 year old self to do her bidding on the account of having “a common goal of restoring our beautiful family”. This bullshit was pretty heavy from an emotional standpoint for a kid. And to make matters worse, I had to do this pretty much everytime I had a chance to see my father then come back home and recite every single word and gesture uttered by him to my mother.

It made me feel like shit every single time and I would call him or something just to fill in any sentances I might have missed while she would listen to the phone call on speaker. At some point she figured that it would be better if I would always call him at midnight, talking to him on the speaker while she rubs written papers with the dialogue I had to recite in my face all while analysing the responses and writing more appropriate shit for me to say. 

I got fed up. I was just a kid and at about 13 I told her that I wouldn’t talk to him anymore about any of this and that there are no chances of him ever returning.
As you may have guessed by now, she did NOT take that well. I’ve heard it all, “You don’t love me enough to help me rebuild this family, you don’t care about us, I’ve done everything for you and I love you please do this for me...”. I told her that I am sorry but no. The shitshow continued for about 3 days. I couldn’t take it any longer and this is when I first started lying. I would just come home after spending time with my dad and telling her how he told me he would come home eventually. I belive it was at this time that I completely stopped caring about anything she said, I was just so fed up that every since then her screaming and tears have absolutely no effect on me. So I just started lying because telling her the truth wasn’t an option and I was actually afraid that she would do some stupid shit if I did so. 

This has been possible because my mother doesn’t talk to my father, AT ALL. I am the messenger that gets any message across so she can’t check anything to see if I am indeed telling the truth. I am now 18 years old and I have been doing this every since the day they have divorced. At the moment my father is aware of the situation and he had tried to tell her he’s not coming back but everything that did was making my life miserable for a month or so until I got my mom back in a comfortable web of lies and false hope. So we pretty much agreed that I would just tell her “Oh he didn’t really say anything when I told him to come back home today” in order to stop lying so much and maybe keep her in a barely stable area.  

Looking back I wish I had aggressively refused to help her at the very start, but I was just a kid, she manipulated me and made me feel like shit if I didn’t cooperate. Every day I have lied, it became a little harder for me to tell her the truth, so I never did. 

My mother doesn’t have any close friends and never leaves the house except when going to work.
My father currently has a girlfriend and plenty of friends. Of course my mother doesn’t know of my father’s girlfriend and there is simply noone to tell her.

So AITA for building a huge web of lies in order to give my mother false hope and make my life more bearable?

1,"AITA For telling my daughter she is making a huge mistake by dropping out of college? | My daughter is 21 and lives with me. Right now she is a full time student at the local university which she JUST transferred to from her community college last semester. Things have admittedly been rough for her this year: she recently went through a very hard breakup, her mother passed about a year ago, and she is dealing with health issues such as lupus. 

However, she also receives a very nice scholarship from this university that essentially means she will never have to pay a dime for college education. Her sister (who is a year older) is excelling at an ivy-league university and has a wonderful career lined up for after graduation. This is where the problem arises, my daughter recently came to me and told me that she is struggling with adjusting to the university and feels as though it is too overwhelming and not a good fit for her. She wants to finish the semester then drop out and return back to her community college. 

I ask her what she's going to do there? She tells me she wants to pursue a dental hygienist degree. In other words, she wants to stop at a two year degree. Originally she was pursuing nursing at her university and would have a much more lucrative and four-year degree. I ask her how she intends to pay for all of this? She tells me she has enough saved up from her part-time jobs to cover the entire cost of the program. So essentially she is throwing away her savings instead of pursuing a much better degree for much less costs.

Now, this is where I may be the asshole. I told her I thought that this decision was a mistake and that although things were difficult for her right now, she needed to grow up and keep pushing through her issues or else she would just be giving up. She is jeopardizing her future because she wants to be lazy or because she cannot get a handle on her life. She was upset at this and said it was her own life and she was free to do as she liked.

I usually am tasked to pick my younger nephews (Ages 8 and 10) up after school.
What I usually do is catch public  transport, pick them up and walk home.

The drive is usually a 5 minute drive from my home and about a 20 to 30 minute walk back home.
The kids like to walk so they don't mind. 
And it saves a ton of busfare.

Anyway, usually my mom collects the kids if im not there.
Sometimes another kid in the neighborhood would walk with us.

Let's call him Jay. Jay is about 8


Jay is not a bad kid, he isn't friendly towards me, but he isn't rude.
I make sure everyone walks safely etc. Buy them snacks if i had the money etc


Jay eventually started going home on his own without us sometimes. Sometimes walking by us not speaking or hardly doing it at all.


We had a rainy day one evening.  Dark and gloomy, moderate showers.
I really didn't want to walk home with the kids. I didn't walk with an umbrella as well. I knew they had raincoats so i decided that day I'd let them take the bus with me as to avoid being in murky weather.

I get there, find my nephews by themselves and told them we will take the bus.


Jay rolls up in his raincoat and just kinda stands next to us.

Now my dilemma.

I seriously only walked with enough busfare for me and my 2 nephews.

I told Jay sorry i was not walking home today, Im catching the bus and I didn't have enough busfare with me.
He was wearing a raincoat and it was lightly showering. 

He just kinda shrugged and left. Not sure if with other kids or not.

I caught the bus.

One of my nephews Nate said he didn't mind walking home.

I felt really guilty because he was moody he could'nt walk with his friend.
My other nephew was unbothered and just excited about the bus ride.

My mom says i should have walked home with them all as the rain was not that heavy.

We built a very solid friendship but I pushed for something more and eventually we made the jump. We are quite different people, but we get on brilliantly and I could see me having a life with her.

So recently I was chatting to a close friend of mine over some beers. Not enough to be drunk, but we were both speaking quite candidly. He says he has been struggling to find a relationship because none of the girls he gets along with are ""his type"" physically. I responded basically saying maybe he should try dating someone like that anyway because if he did gel really well he could get past that. I could see he wasn't really taking me seriously so I said ""Seriously, I don't think /redactedGFname/ is massively attractive and certainly isn't my type"". Now he was listening I explaind that I though from an objective stance she looks a bit above average as women go, but nothing ground breaking, and that my type would be thiccer with decent breasts whereas she is pencil thin and flat as paper. But, crucially, I care massively for her and there is nobody I would rather be looking at. There are all these little things about her that make me love her. He seemed to take it onboard so we moved on and continued with the night.

Fast forward to 2 nights ago and he was at a party with my GF I couldn't go to because of workload. I didn't get to see her till late the following day. She said the party was fun, but was quite cold with me all evening so I asked of something happened at the party, and it turns out while drunk my mate had told her about our conversation and made it sound like I though she was unattractive. Now, I strongly believe in being honest in all instances, and I also didn't think there was anything wrong with voicing these opinions, and so I tried explaining to her the actual full opinion, but clearly she didn't agree with me there, saying things like ""how can you truly love someone if you don't find them attractive"" which is not what I had said at all. She also said this wasn't something that should be said, especially not to other people and that it'd a show of disrespect to her, which I would concede if it wasn't a close friend I was trying to give advice to.

1,"AITA for telling people why a friend and his wife are skipping the wedding? | Hi reddit,

I feel I might have been an AH in a situation that passed this weekend, but I don’t feel like I was wrong. 

Names changed for privacy! 

I have a core group of friends from college that regularly keep in touch. Almost all of us are now married/have kids, except for Jane who is getting married this weekend. We’re all pretty excited for Jane’s wedding because it’ll give us all a chance to catch up.

Last month, Jane emailed us to say that they were not going to uninvite anyone coming from abroad (at the time there were very few cases in the US), unless they were symptomatic or had been knowingly exposed to a sick person. She said that if anyone was not comfortable with this, they could skip the wedding/wear a mask/etc. and she would not be offended, but to let her know ASAP so she could make arrangements with her caterer. We were all cool with it and no one backed out.

One of our friends (Alice) is flying in from New York where there are currently 100+ cases of coronavirus. Jane said she was still welcome to come as she was not sick. This weekend, my friend Bill and his wife Jill announced that they would not be attending the wedding over concerns with the coronavirus. Jill is about 5 months pregnant. 

Jane as annoyed because they’re cancelling last minute even though she disclosed early on that people from riskier countries were coming to the wedding, which was after Jill had announced her pregnancy. 

I pressed Bill on why he was cancelling and he basically said that Jill refused to go because Alice was coming from NYC. He also said that Jill won’t let him see any of us at all until two weeks after our last interaction with Alice, since that is the incubation period for the virus. Apparently Jill told him to ask Alice to skip the wedding if he wanted to go so badly but he refused. 

I thought that was stupid because he and Jill work in customer service facing jobs and see people all the time. I always thought that Jill didn’t like our group and think she’s just using this as an excuse to skip events with us. Many of us live out of state and won’t be together until probably next year. He agreed but said she played the pregnancy card so he couldn’t do anything.

Over the weekend we got together for a small pre-wedding celebration and them skipping the wedding came up. I told them what Bill said and they all said that was dumb and they agreed with my assessment about Jill.

Alice confronted Bill and now him and Jill are fighting about it. Jill blames me (and Alice) for making her the bad person, and Bill thinks I threw her under the bus. I think skipping the wedding with no notice is a dick move, but a few people said I shouldn’t have done that.

0,"WIBTA for telling a friend she's not a good mother? | My friend S (30s) is obsessed with her firstborn child E since she's been born and spoils her rotten after a difficult birth. 

By now, she's remarried and the second baby with her second husband is on the way. Partly, it seems like she wants E not only to always love her and never be cross with her, but she also thrives on her child being dependent (she's not potty-trained and regresses when she hasn't her mother's undivided attention, like pretending to be unable to feed herself as soon as her mother has visitors or is on the phone). She never scolds the child for being naughty, she comforts the child even when wrong and tries to prevent every frustration of the child's desires.  

Now, the problem is this: She doesn't allow her new husband to play any role in the life of E. E is a terrible child, pouty, manipulative and outright savage. Her doting mother S is ALWAYS on her side and lets her do whatever she wants. S tells me things like how she thinks naughty, misbehaving children are cute and that she wants to ""protect"" her child. I might add that S suffers from severe anxiety disorder, so I do not trust her to actually be able to make the difference between a real threat and an imagined one. Whenever her new husband tries to make E behave, E ends up screaming and throwing a tantrum. 

Of course, S steps in, blames her husband, consoles the child and basically rewards the child for first misbehaving and then making a scene about being told off. S says she doesn't want her kid to be ""sad"" and that she doesn't want E to ""not get along"" with her new husband, so she is angry with her  hubby for not letting E behave like a rabid monkey. She also admits that she herself, a grown woman, is ""traumatised"" by these altercations and she projects that hurt onto her child.  I am very afraid for the baby who is going to be born into a divided family, where her mother will favour her firstborn because ""it has always just been the two of them"" and ""E doesn't have anyone else"" (even though her father is still in the picture) and a step-father who will soon give up on raising her as his own when the mother refuses his help.

Yes, S has said that she doesn't want any intervention into her relationship with E. She's already dividing the children by wording like ""my child"" and ""his child"" and the husband's family will definitely make the children feel the difference, so I think that the mother of the kids should not reinforce that division.

I am pretty sure that she's raising an anxiety-riddled, narcissistic bully who could end up hurting her baby sister and I believe that S, the mother, should be told.

After my daughter's passing my husband had an affair with his close friend which resulted in a baby girl Zoe. Now Zoe's mother was a troubled woman who suffered from post partum depression, which ultimately took her life. My husband was regretful of his actions and worked hard to prove that he was willing to be loyal from that day that on. I decided to forgive him and accept the baby as my own. 

Zoe is now 6 years old and is a bright young girl. I love her but one thing which has been bothering me a lot is that Zoe looks a lot like her mother. Somehow when I look at her face for too long, I get triggered. 

After the cheating, I've struggled with being intimate with my husband. Things improved in the last 3 years, and my husband had recently expressed his desire of having another child. He has been really desperate for a baby. Now all this time, I've taken pills in secret, however, I ended up conceiving 2 months ago on a family trip. 

I forgot to take pills one morning, and  ended up pregnant. My husband is beyond excited. He cried happy tears when I told him about the pregnancy.

 Zoe has been going all around telling her friends that she was going to become a big sister. My inlaws feel that this baby will finally heal our wounds. My husband talks to my belly all the time. He is being incredibly affectionate and loving. He gets emotional wherever he talks about the baby. 

Now the biggest problem is that I don't feel connected to this baby at all. Recently, an ex came into my life after 10 years. We have reconnected and our friendship is going strong. We often talk about our lives. He recently got cheated on and left, so we've talked to each other about our experiences. 

Things took a drastic turn for me last week when I saw a dream. In the dream, I had just given birth to my baby and my husband was there holding our baby in his arms. When I looked up to see my husband's face, I saw my ex. My actual husband wasn't there in the dream and neither was Zoe. 

Ever since I saw the dream, I've come to the realization that I no longer see a future with my husband. I do want a family of my own someday, but I don't want a baby WITH HIM. 


I've been thinking of getting an abortion but can't tell my husband because it will destroy him. I really want to leave this marriage and start over. I want to explore where things go with my ex.

I have no family so her parents really stepped up. They helped me with my son, his grandma looked after him while I worked, etc.

Now my son is 5. I got remarried 2 years ago after being in a relationship for over a year. She is the only mom my son knows. He knows about his birth mom, but calls my wife “mommy” and loves her to bits. She’s a SAHM and is great with him.

The issue lies with my son’s grandparents. They do not like my wife. My wife has been fine with them being in our lives, but they are just awful around her. They make nitpicks about her and get mad at me when I defend her. It’s gotten to the point where they still see my son, but they take him on their own and we’re not around.

Recently, my wife and I have been working on adoption papers so she can legally adopt my son. My son’s grandparents found out and were pissed. I said I wasn’t trying to replace their daughter but that my son loved her like a mom and I wanted us to be a family. They said a bunch of nasty things and then threatened to contest the adoption. I’ve spoken to a lawyer so I know they’d likely lose. But this pissed me off. I said until my son is old enough to make his own choices, they are out of his life. They suddenly got apologetic and said they wouldn’t do it, but I said it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. They’ve texted me non stop since, saying I’m cruel.

My ex’s sister texted me and I assured her she could still see him, as long as she doesn’t bring him around them. She said that’s fine but thought I was being harsh, don’t I get their POV?

1,"AITA for Making My Girlfriend Choose Me Over a Friend In Need | My girlfriend and I have been together about 4 years and living together for about 2 in a house that she owns. We have one dog. Since we aren't married yet and I am not contributing to the mortgage I pull my weight wherever else I can. The house has one bathroom and an extra room upstairs. If I am not gaming occasionally in another room of the house, we spend the majority of our time in the living room since there is nowhere else to hang out.

This past Saturday, a friend of hers that I have only hung out with a few times and don't know very well, broke up with a boyfriend of 8 years or so and my girlfriend invited her to stay the night to get away from the situation. Her family lives about an hour or so away, and I don't know much about her friends outside of my girlfriend. The EX does not want her staying at their place even though he has family he can stay with. Next thing I know, she is bringing more of her stuff over and telling us that she doesn't plan on being with us for more than a month while she looks for an apartment.

While it's not my house, it's a place I have been calling home for the past two years and I am upset that my g/f never told her friend that she would need to have a conversation with me about this before committing to anything. I am apparently just supposed to be okay with it. 

We have been arguing about how all of this has been handled. She wants to be there for her friend and doesn't think having someone at our place where I spend more time than her is a big deal. I think that the girl should have had a plan in place prior to the breakup, and don't mind helping her out for a few weeks.

Needless to say I have a lot of baggage in relationships with not feeling worthy of my partners and have attached an unhealthy amount of importance to validation from males.

He often asks me if it is good. 

I feel so horribly guilty about it but I don'think that it is. He uses names and traits that are literally identical to famous literary characters and scenarios that are action 101. He is aware of this and thinks it is fine. The book isn't a 'oh that reminds me of....' it is flat out 'oh this is from that movie...'. If someone sued him for copyright, I'd think 'that's fair', in fact if I was them, I would. He sets it in a different country which he says makes it not fan fic and that it is 'inspired' by the original. 

 I cannot criticise the book in any way because although he says he wants an 'honest opinion' constantly, if I even suggest a word change, I get a half an hour on why that word was chosen and he brings it up subsequently when he mentions it eg: 'I know you hate the (word) in chapter 5 but...' even months later. He is snarky and catty about even if he feels like I haven't listened to the latest part with enough enthusiasm. 

His father always made him feel worthless and so he is sensitive. 

He will talk to me for ages about a plot twist or the latest situation and I listen and he feels great afterwards and thanks me profusely for being 'so supportive' when I've just agreed with him the entire time.

I think he could write a fictional pov about his real life (which is interesting) and people would lap that up. He disagrees.

She found out I saw someone die when I was 12 and thinks I am traumatized by it and need therapy. | Me and my fiance went over her brothers last week and her brother had a gun of guns. I told him I was uncomfortable around guns because I grew up in a neighborhood that had a lot of gun violence and I would prefer if they didn't shoot any of them near me. One of them asked 'why it was so bad', and I told them how bad my old neighborhood was. I also mentioned I saw a drive by shooting when I was 12 that hit a guy and killed him. My fiance sort of looked at me and said ""how come you never told me this?"" and I just said it never crossed my mind, and it was such a brief moment that I never thought it was a big deal. She was sour with me the entire night. At the end of the night, she asked me kind of angrily why I never told her that I saw someone get shot. I told her I never really thought it was a big deal and that it didn't affect me much because it was such a quick moment, and that I only found out he died the next day. She was quiet for a while, then asked again basically saying that its crazy I wouldn't think its a big deal to tell her something like that. She said that I could have PTSD and I need therapy and that she feels uncomfortable at the idea that I wouldn't tell her such a 'major part of my life' like that before we got married. Honestly, I just never thought about it that much. Some part of me thinks I shouldn't have even mentioned it at the table. 

&#x200B;

We've been arguing a bit on and off about this. She feels like she might have potentially married a traumatized person who was hiding their trauma, and that she feels like I have been dishonest with her on purpose, and she wants me to go to therapy. The thing is, she knew where I came from and how bad my neighborhood was. Seeing one guy get shot briefly was not the defining moment of the problems back then. I've also been to therapy for anxiety and she knows this, and I told her that I have mentioned my background, and she said I specifically need to see a trauma specialist.

0,"AITA for declining my best friend's wedding invitation? |  

Hi AITA.

tldr; My best friend(28M) and I (25F) have been online friends for roughly 5years. I would say he's one of my bestest guy friends. I have seen him struggle with his relationships, seen him go from job to job and saw him thrive in his current relationship now. Recently he had asked me if I would attend his wedding and I of course said I am going to decline out of respect for his fiance.

Here's some backstory:

He and I met on an online server. We've never actually met in person but we kicked it super well and have continuously stayed friends for 5 years now. When he first met his now fiance, I helped him plan his first date and even now every little detail of how he had custom made her wedding ring to where he had asked for her hand in marriage. I absolutely adore her, at one point we all were in a group chat together, I talked to her privately via text. I thought we were all pretty good friends until about a year ago when my bff told me that his fiance was actually pretty uncomfortable with me. He said every time he brought me up, she would get pretty moody. He would also say that she didn't like that we had so much inside jokes, also how he had a crush on me, just the whole idea of us being friends really made her uncomfortable. I eventually distanced myself so that they can cool off and he made the effort to tell his fiance that there was nothing more than a solid friendship.

We would text nonchalantly but never to the extent of how our friendship normally was. Recently this year we started talking normally again. I miss my best friend but I also told him that I understood boundaries and I never want to make his fiance feel like she is less than or feel like I am competing for his attention, or whatever she may feel. I've always tried to accommodate her feelings to make it known that I was only his friend and even waved my relationship around saying we should go on double dates if I ever decided to meet my bff and her in person to make sure that she knew I had my own relationship and never wanted to step in hers.

So a couple days ago, he had told me that they had a date for their wedding and asked if I would come. I had asked him about how his fiance felt and he stayed silent. I took the silence as she didn't really feel comfortable about me still, so I softly declined out of respect for his fiance because I never want to make her day be less special because of my presence. It sucks because he is my best friend and I would love to be there for him but I know the circumstances wouldn't be favorable.

Personally, I feel like an asshole whether I showed up or not. I know my best friend doesn't want to have to choose between his life partner and his best woman friend.

So we went to visit my grandfather's grave-- me, my mom, grandma, and aunt. Beside his grave is the grave of a close family friend, so we asked the daughter of his family to come with us. She brought her eldest daughter.

So we were all paying our respects and greeting each other (especially with our family friend's daughter, since we haven't seen her in a while). Let's call her E.

E and my aunt started to have their own conversation because E mentioned that she's going to divorce her husband-- he's abusive and he instigates fights in front of E's two daughters, and naturally they're affected by it.

Now, in our family, only my parents got divorced. They did the same thing-- fight in front of me. They finalized the divorce when I was 6. It still bothers me and it used to be a real sore spot growing up, but I've grown to accept it when I became an adult. I'm almost 20, for reference.

So, of course, my aunt knows this. She started to make comments to E and in front of E's daughter, knowing I was in the vicinity, that were backhanded jabs towards the effects of divorce on *me.* She was saying things like, ""look how vulfreim turned out!"" ""see what happened to vulfreim!"" ""children who see fighting and go through divorce tend to have behavioral problems as they grow up!"" ""vulfreim always acts hateful towards family because of it."" Stuff like that.

I know my aunt has issues with my 'attitude problem,' but I simply just do not like my mother's side of the family because they're judgy, nitpicky, pretentious people that I would avoid if they weren't related. It really rubbed me the wrong way that, in front of E and her daughter, my aunt was making comments about this and trying to tie it into the upcoming divorce.

Eventually I honestly had enough of it. I was at a distance with my mom, at least a yard away from the others. But I approached my aunt and pulled her aside, and asked her to knock it the fuck off and to not use me as an example, as it's disrespectful to assume the effects of divorce. She didn't go through it and she never bothered to connect with me in such a way, so she has zero right to make all these comments. She scoffed and didn't say anything, though she did drop the subject.

Boomer was their dog. They got him as a pup 4 years ago. In the last 3 years, my mom got lots of phone calls of S calling, screaming that M is horribly abusing boomer. Pushing him down stairs, throwing his shit at him, and other unspeakable things. He abused the dog horribly because that’s how he thought dogs should be trained. I know, disgusting.

So about a year ago, I visited and saw boomer was obese. So I started taking him on hikes. He loved it and bonded to me, then started to hate home. S would say things like you should have him but M is super attached to him. After a vet visit they said he had Hypothyroidism, causing him to gain weight and needs to be on a pill for the rest of his life. M thought boomer would never be the same, so he thought about giving him up. It was super hard, as this was his best friend. S was trying hard to get M to give boomer up, because that’s what would have been best for him. Eventually, after lots of emotions and tears, M decided to give him up. In all the emotion, it was said that there would be no problems letting them take boomer for a weekend or something. It wasn’t discussed any further then that. I had no issues with that at the time, as boomer wasn’t mine yet.

The first day I got him I took him to the vet and got the medication he needs. I knocked 60lbs off and In that time he grew a super strong bond to me and my boyfriend. We put a lot of work into making him ours. He’s a different dog.

Yesterday, S texted me asking if they could have Boomer for the weekend after all this stuff going on because their boy is really missing him. I totally don’t feel comfortable with that.

I've made a rule that they can no longer stay at my house.  She always insists the current is different, and this one is a step up from the daddy figure she lived with before but I think he has red flags and they moved in together too fast, she knows this.  In the past her boyfriends have destroyed her credit and businesses, we had worked together in the past but I don't want to be involved with anything that her boyfriends have a hand in.  My friend has daddy issues and casts these guys as saviors, I have asked her to talk to a therapist about this and the therapist thought she was making up the over-the-top enmeshment she gets into with these larger than life dad types.

My wife and I (both women) started dating when she was 19 and I was 24. We are now 25 and 30, respectively. When I first met my wife (we’ll call her Andrea), she told me that while she’d always dreamed of children that she wanted to wait until she was a bit older.     
          
When we decided we were ready for children, we went to her doctor to discuss her concerns for the pregnancy. From the time we met, we had agreed she would carry any children we had because we both found it weird for me to do so (I play the more masculine role for lack of a better word). Andrea was concerned about her mental health due to years of various medications and her struggle to cope with her major depression. She has been in therapy for 10 years and only recently found a medication that has improved her mood.       
          
I expressed little excitement in my wife carrying our baby, and let her know my concerns. She and her doctor suggested that perhaps I carry our baby, which I was not okay with. I let Andrea know that she could either carry the baby or we could have a surrogate do so, but I was completely off the table.            
        
She was pissed and said that I was selfish for going to have someone else carry our baby with two capable women able to. She decided she would carry our baby.         
           
Well our IVF experience blessed us with twins, two baby girls. However my wife has gone off the deep end and is severely depressed and has expressed that she’s now afraid of herself.          
    
I’m pissed. I told her that she is so selfish for this. Not only is she caring for the girls very well but she also had to quit her job because she is so mentally unwell plus we have no one to watch the girls daily, and so now I have to suffer financially (we are comfortable without her income but it still was helpful) and I have a lot more responsibility with the girls due to her being locked away in the bedroom.                 
             
She screamed at me that if anyone is selfish, that it’s me and that I am making her feel “less than” as a mother. I told her that I will never have a child with her again unless a surrogate carries it, and that alone set her off. She took the girls and is staying at her dads. Her brother messaged me letting me know that I need to leave Andrea alone until I know how to be a good partner.       
       
Am I really the asshole here? She knowingly carried our daughters with the possibility of her condition worsening and now I have to pay the price.

Me (19F) and my bf (20M) come back from a dance class, and dinner together. Even the walk to my place was nice.

So, we’re lying on my bed, both on our phones but we’re still cuddling somehow. He's watching me do the wrk on my phone, and then it slips out of my hand, and ofc lands on his cheek. I immediately say ""Oh my god I'm sorry"" and try to kiss his cheek, but he blcks me with his hand and removes my arm from around him, turning to face away.

A little over an hr passes and still no txt from him, so I go back to my rm to find him sleeping. I poke him and ask if he plans to sleep the rest of the night, he says yes, then I ask if he's mad at me, he says no. I ask to tlk for a sec. He starts:

""What do u want.""

""why did u get so upset earlier?""

""U know why.""

""Ok, but it was an accident, it slipped out of my hand.""

""Yeah, anyone would've reacted like that.""

""No, the other person would apologize, and everyone moves on. So why did u react like that?""

""It slipped out I can't control that!""

""Have better control of ur hands.""

""Do u hear how ridiculous u sound?? Accidents happen, I apologized and u still shunned me and stopped talking to me for 2 hrs”

""What's ur point.""

I was quiet, then said "" Ur whole night is going to be ruined bc my phone slipped out of my hand. We were supposed to be doing work together, being productive, but instead I had to give u space, and go work alone in the living room. I'm doing my work, but my chest is tight because ur not talking to me and it's making it hard to focus. I'm sitting in there feeling so shitty like I did something so wrong.

There are a couple factors at play here as to why we may be having difficulties, so my thought is to rule out as much as possible. She has a bleeding disorder and a family history of ovarian cysts, and I am a bit concerned about whether or not we will even be able to have children. 
Yesterday, we found out that for yet another month, we were unsuccessful. In my frustration, I put my hands on my head and she immediately followed with “why are you making this about you?” I tried to explain that I was struggling with each month getting our hopes up and that she probably felt the same way. She didn’t want to hear my side and it ended in an argument about how I “make it about me.” I can understand how I could have put my feelings aside, but in the moment after hearing a “no” again, I was a bit distraught.
I followed up by suggesting that she go and get a check up. For the last 9 months she has been without insurance (quit her job to pursue a dream of hers, and has no benefits). I recently was able to get her on my benefits, and so this is a possibility. She is making the claim that it is her body, and that it is her decision. I can’t force her to go get checked up. 
Her big Hangup is that doctors typically say that you need to try to conceive for 1 year before bothering them with any concerns of issues with pregnancy. We are at month 6. I suggested that my wife tell a white lie (how will they know when we started anyway?) in order to find out if there are any issues with her bleeding disorder, or cysts. She again reiterated that it isn’t my choice, and that she wanted to wait for a year.

So back in December I had a couple of family members reach out and want to ""reconnect"". One of the two, my Aunt, I've not seen since 1998 when she and my mother fell out. My cousin, her daughter, I've not seen since 2007 when it transpired she was at the same school I was at and very quickly moved to London with her mother and my uncle (my mother and aunts half brother).

So all had been well, up until last week. My cousin called me in tears saying oh she can't afford essentials for her two children (I knew she had a child but didn't know about 2), diapers and milk and stuff, could I please send her about a tenner (£10) that she would give back to me in the morning.

Being the sucker I am, 8 said to her yes okay you can have that, because I won't ever see a child go without. But, half an hour later my aunt called me and asked could give them an extra twenty or thirty pounds for food. She sent me a picture of the bank account she wanted it to go to, which was for my uncle mentioned above, who is known in my local area for being a habitual drunk and drug user. 

I said no to my aunt's request guys because I'd literally spent money in my wedding dress that week, and my dog got rushed to the vets as an emergency (which cost me, my partner, and his parents almost a thousand between us) so I had no money at all. The ten pounds I sent for the diapers was stretching it a bit, literally like scraping the pot for that. I apologises and said I'm sorry, but no I've not seen you for 22 years and I simply cannot afford it. My aunt said ""I guess you don't care about us then"" and out the phone down.

0,"AITA for being a picky eater? | So first context is needed. I'm currently a student who begins uni in 2 years. I've lived almost my entire life with my mom and my brother. I've always been picky with food ever since I was little. 

A year ago my mom got a new boyfriend and pretty quickly he moved into the house. He's a big fan of food and likes to experiment with it. He cooks for us about three times a week because his job means he spends a lot of time at home anyways.

So here's where I come in. I'm a picky eater. It's not something I willingly choose to be, and I always at least try food before coming to a desision of weather I like it. The problem for me mainly is sauces, which I often dislike for their flavour (not all of them, but so far I dislike more then I like out of what I have tried). So my moms bf is very keen on sauces and likes to include them in a load of his cooking. So me naturally being me I try his foods but after a couple of bites I almost always dislike it.

I wanna clarify that I hate that I'm picky with foods. It's not a choice I made it's just always been this way. I always try to be polite as possible and have confronted my mom and her bf about it several times but they always take great offence to it as if I choose to dislike the food they make. Every time I don't enjoy it they always look at me with disgust and tell me that it's good, acting as if there's something wrong with me. At this point I feel like there is but idk anymore.

His caregiver visits him daily at his new place. I did this because I wanted my son to be independent. 

He did very well for a few months but recently he has gotten into a relationship with a 58 year old man that I simply do not approve of.

0,"AITA for not wanting to deal with my best friend’s chaotic life anymore? | I’ve [F26] been friends with this person [F25] since we were 13. She is a great friend in terms of being there to listen. Her family and her have always been poor. Her mother has never been a good role model - keeping publicly abusive relationships, drinking constantly and not being there for her daughter. Her family life over all has always been hard.  She has dealt with depression and anxiety her whole life.

My friend has never been able to keep a job more than a couple months since high school. She just quits randomly. I’ve paid thousands of dollars for her over the years in the form of rent, food and entertainment so that she can enjoy nights out with our friend group. 

She has two children who she sees every other week because her and the dad are separated. When she doesn’t have the kids, she goes on drinking benders. During these, she will start shit with her family members and boyfriends causing huge fights. She just got a DUI a couple months ago and is now on probation but is refusing to stop drinking or doing drugs.

She has wanted to kill herself for years, and has acted on it tens of times. She will blow up everyone’s phones saying she is taking a bottle of pills and then not answer anyone’s calls. This causes her loved ones to leave responsibilities like work, racing around town while in tears trying to find her and getting the cops involved. Last episode she had called me for the first time saying she was going to kill herself which sent me into a panic and i had to go track her down thinking my friend would be dead by the time I got there. Every time is has turned out she didn’t actually take pills and she was saying/doing crazy shit cause she had been drinking. I have stopped inviting her out with new people because she will show up wasted and embarrass me.

I was already distancing myself a bit because I couldn’t emotionally deal with the chaos, but the last straw was when I foolishly let her borrow a few hundred dollars. She had a new job and seemed to be doing well, so I told her yes but I needed it back in two weeks. She promised me she’d have the money back to me “100%”. She said she needed help because her kids’ dad fucked her over on daycare. Turns out she quit that job the day prior (after 1 week of being there) and that she actually needed that money for rent. She told me all of this a week later and genuinely didn’t seem to realize that her story was much different than what she told me before. That deadline is now three months ago. She has brought up paying me back once. She got another job a couple weeks ago and I heard from a friend she already quit it.

She’s had a history of dating physically and mentally abusive men. Yesterday I get a call from her mom asking if I’d seen her because she hadn’t come home. I say no and automatically know what this is about. The night prior she had texted me bragging how she cheated on her boyfriend. This boyfriend has blatantly said to our group of friends that he’s not afraid to beat a woman. I knew he was evil. Turns out her sister told him that she had cheated on him, he drove to her house, broke in, smashed her phone and beat her. She now has bruises all over her and is (hopefully) getting a restraining order. I was not surprised at all, I told my friend he’d beat her one day and my friend (who is also one of her bfs) didn’t believe me. He is an overly-obvious abusive person. Yelling at her constantly in front of strangers, acting crazy all of the time.

In summary, I’m caught up because I have suffered from crippling anxiety and depression but it’s never brought this type of destruction onto everyone around me or myself. It seems at this point she’s choosing all of these awful things to happen to her at this point. (Besides being beat obviously). Blatantly self-sabotaging. Which I know can be from mental illness. Where do you draw the line blaming it on mental illness? I don’t want to be dragged into this anymore. I care about her and her wellbeing but it’s been 10 years of this chaos. 

Something happens every week. And every week either she or her mom will call me to talk about it, thinking that I need to be informed of what happened. The same shit that always happens. Nothing ever changes, and in fact gets worse every year. It brings a lot of stress onto to me and has ruined a lot of days for me, crying, leaving social setting to go make sure she’s okay or sitting around in anxiety over how she’s doing.

0,"WIBTA if I won't visit my parents anymore if they won't stop pressuring me about having a child? | English isn't my first language so please excuse any mistakes. I've (24F) been together with my boyfriend (26M) for a bit more than 3 years and after one year (which was way too early in my opinion), my parents started to ask me if we wanted a child or not. Now the thing is I can't stand children, if there were a room full of spiders and a room with only one child, my arachnophobic ass still would choose the first one. So I said no. I think my parents didn't take me seriously and when they had the chance they asked my bf. He also said no. 

Now everytime we visit them this child topic always comes up and we end up arguing about it. Honestly, it hurts me that they won't believe me when I say I'm truly happy with my life, and I consider ourself (me, bf and our cat) as a family without children. My mom has two closets full of my and my sister's baby clothes because ""they will be useful in the future"". (Oh yes, my sister is 10 years older than me, she doesn't want a children either, but she lives in a different country so I'm the easier target.) I told her to give the clothes to charity or directly to families in need but she doesn't listen to me. My father is more passive-agressive, saying things like ""life doesn't have a meaning without family"", and of course family MUST include children.

Our visits become less frequent in the past months because of this tension and I know they are sad because we visit them just once in every 2 or 3 months. I asked them many times to respect our opinion, but I feel like they can and will continue to pressure us.

I like him. We’ve been seeing each other about once a week and have been on a couple of dates around town. However, recently he suggested that we go to his friend’s lake house about an hour away from our town. He said that he goes every summer and is excited at the idea of bringing me along this time around. When I asked who else besides his friend would be there, he said several other friends, all of which are also guys. I wasn’t exactly wanting to go in the first place because I feel as if I’m not ready to take a weekend long trip with him just yet as we’ve only been on about 4 dates, so when he said that there would be about 5-6 guys there with me being the only girl, I said that I wasn’t interested. 

He kept pushing me and eventually I asked if it would be okay if I were to bring a girlfriend with me, and he said no, that his friend typically doesn’t include guests other than his close friends, and is making an exception for me. I again declined and now my boyfriend is becoming upset because he believes that I’m
insinuating that I don’t trust his friends or think that they’re bad people. He said it shouldn’t make a difference whether or not I’m the only girl there because his friends aren’t “rapists.” I’m not exactly claiming that at all, I’m simply uncomfortable with the idea and feel like it’s a big step in our relationship when it’s only been a month.

She said she had a lot of baby gears that she got for free from doing online reviews and that she would be more than happy to give them to me. I thanked her and told her that I would stop by to pick them up when I'm ready. 2 weeks later, she called out of the blue and offered to drop off the baby stuffs that day. I told her she did not need to but she insisted and I caved in. I told her she can come whenever that day but I probably would not be available for too long as I had to feed our baby and pump around the clock. She said ok and ended up coming around 4PM that day.

She brought over about $200 worth of baby stuffs which she got for free from doing online reviews. She saw our son and we chatted a bit. As we are not closed, there were a lot of awkward silences. At one point, she asked when I usually have dinner. That is when I realized that she was expecting us to feed her. 

Now we recently moved to our current house in preparation for the arrival of our son so we got no food in the fridge. Due to the baby, we had also been getting take-outs. We would have to go out to pick up food if we wanted to have dinner with her. In addition, while here, her teenage son got bored and decided to taunt our dogs who were chilling in the backyard. The dogs started to bark like crazy at him. He would not stop taunting our dogs despite me and my husband telling him that the dogs do not like what he was doing. 

Eventually I got annoyed so I told her that I needed to go back to the nursery room to feed our baby. I then rushed them out to the door and told them I would take them out for lunch in the near future. 

Looking back, I suppose I could go get food before they came over but that means I would have to eat dinner with them instead of taking a much needed nap. Hubby said it was rude of them to expect us to entertain them knowing we just had a baby. So here I am trying to put this to rest: redditors, was I the asshole?

So today while at a short trip to Walmart i found myself in an uncomfortable situation. While in the self check out cash register I over heard a mother and a daughter arguing.Some information that will be useful further on this story: I am a heavier female, I am also recently pregnant, The mother is fairly young around her early 30's and is average weight, not too skinny and not too heavy, the daughter who is about 13 years old is wearing some fairly tight booty shorts and a tank top that looked like she was wearing it since last year before her growth spurg, she was a little on the bigger side and you could tell that she was starting to fill in. The argument went something like this:

Daughter: Mom pleaseee pleasee pleaseee can i get some chocolate?!

Mother: No, we have enough snacks here you can have something when we get home

Daughter: But we don't have any chocolate please can I just have one and we can share

Mother: (Sounding more frustrated now) I said no so stop asking.

Daughter: (Sounding desperate and ready to cry) Mom please please please here we can get reasees that's your favorite type of chocolate, ill just have one and you can have the rest.

Mother: (Pulling in her daughter close) Stop asking me for candy all the damn time, you keep eating candy like that and you gonna end up looking like her. (Pointing at me)

I turned around trying to give her the benefit of the doubt and understanding she's trying to make a point to her daughter at the expense of my body image, which i don't condone but i'm not going to hop into someone else's parenting bandwagon, but when I turn around all the way to meet her gaze I can tell she was making sure i heard, like a personal vendetta and mind you i don't know this woman, i have never seen her or her daughter in my life.

Me: Excuse me? (I waited for a few seconds for an I'm sorry or something but she just looked at me like i was dumb or something so i continued) I'll have you know I am actually 5 months pregnant (I'm not that far along but i thought id use it at my advantage to make her feel somewhat bad for talking about someones body)

She then rolled her eyes at me and said ""So?"" like i just meddled in her conversation and it was my fault if my feelings got hurt so i kinda snapped.

Me: Well you're absolutely right, they way your daughter keeps going and how you're dressing her she will most definitely end up like me, PREGNANT!

She looked appalled for a good moment but she didn't anything else other than give me really nasty side eye, I already had my groceries bagged and loaded in my cart to I went ahead and swiped my card and walked away without checking if the transaction went through fine or without grabbing the receipt, while I'm walking away i hear what I think is the girl crying, almost bawling hysterically, I didn't bother to look back, i was steamed and i just wanted out of the whole situation

1,"AITA for putting the work in to find a woman's lost wedding ring in lake after they gave up looking for it weeks before? | This happened a couple weeks ago.  A big group of us were staying on a lake.  A woman who I had never met before was wearing her wedding ring while she was swimming/playing around.  At one point it fell off her hand and fell into shallow water.  A bunch of us ended up spending alot of time trying to find their ring including using snorkel gear and some old cheap metal detector but never found it.

I suggested to the couple to go out, rent a nice water proof metal detector, and do some searching.  Instead the husband pretty much gave up and put very little effort into looking for it.  He didn't go out and get a metal detector and he only looked for about an hour.  It was frustrating to see so little effort put forth into looking for a 6k ring that had alot of sentimental value.

The following week I rented a very nice metal detector for 45$ and a digging set and drove back to the lake (4 hours away).  After 2 hours BOOM I found the ring.  I was planning on going to a Jeweler / police and asking them to see if the ring had been lost or reported stolen.  Since I know neither one of these will popup since the couple know they lost it in a lake I was going to cash in afterwards.

Question is, now what?  I may have just met the couple but I know who they are and could return it to them.

It is one built on codependence, where I have often been made to feel responsible for his loneliness. It led to some drastic decisions on my part, like giving up my business that I really enjoyed and felt fulfilled by. (He didn’t ask me to do so, but I felt it was the right choice at the time because I felt so stressed out trying to manage his expectations). We’re both trying to work on our marriage in the aftermath: bitterness and resentment from me, and his feeling that I’m holding grudges against him. 

On this occasion, I told him about the dinner that will be happening towards the latter half of Dec, and said I’d be cooking for them. He asked if I wanted him to be out of the house. Now thinking back, the phrasing of the question sounded strange, but I don’t have very good communication skills (I often sound harsher than I intend), so it didn’t pique much interest. I said there wasn’t a problem, he could be around. But seconds later, another thought struck me, and I said, hang on, probably a better idea of you’re not there - this isn’t a hangout where there will be partners in attendance. (Which is true). 

I immediately felt his emotions go down - the rhythm and mood of his interactions changed and I started feeling like I could have said things better, or not flip-flopped. 

The truth is, I didn’t really want him around, because even though he knows this group of friends, he often brings down the mood of any group I hang out with. People ask me whether he’s upset etc, and these friends once told me in confidence that I act very different around him. These are people I really care for, because we spent months in a  leader development program, and even though he knows them too, the relationship he has with them is definitely on the same level.

He moved in with someone else (a woman he worked with at the time) immediately after the split and my mum also mentioned in passing - several years later - that the divorce was due to another woman. I've never asked him for his side of the story and frankly that's not a conversation I'm interested in having. I have no reason to think my mum is lying and the circumstances are enough evidence for me. 

My relationship with my dad has been shaky since I was about 14 and now that I'm an adult we no longer have much contact at all. He calls me once a month or so and we see each other maybe once or twice a year.

I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over four years and lately we've talked a lot about getting married. I said I'd much rather have a ""mother of the bride"" speech at the wedding, since my mum knows my boyfriend and I much better than my dad does. Boyfriend agreed that was reasonable.

I also mentioned that I don't want my dad to walk me down the aisle. I'm not a superstitious person but I do think a wedding is the symbolic start of a new chapter, and I don't especially want to walk into married life with someone who took a colossal dump on his own wedding vows. I quite like the idea of walking myself down the aisle to be honest. 

My boyfriend was uncomfortable with completely excluding my dad from wedding formalities. In his view, the walk down the aisle is something that lasts all of about a minute and if we're not going to let him do the speech, then we should at least let him have something. 

I'm in the 'my wedding, my choice' camp but I know walking me down the aisle would mean the world to my dad and he'll be really upset about being excluded.

I messaged him asking if he was the guy at the party and said how much of a coincidence it is we already had mutual friends and he showed up as a suggestion for me to add (maybe this lie wasn't very good, no). He said yes and we started talking.

Lately though I feel since being pregnant my emotions may be getting the best of me? My MIL bought a crib for her house for MY baby. She didn’t say she was buying a crib, and it’s in her teenage son’s room. I feel bad for my SOs little brother and it bothers me immensely that they bought a crib without telling us.

I did tell them the day of that we were buying a pack n play with a bassinet so there is no need for them to have a crib like this. But honestly I don’t want my baby in that crib at all and it doesn’t seem like the crib is going anywhere.

While I’m not planning on visiting their house for at least a few months, I feel really uncomfortable because I do want them to be a part of my baby’s life and I’m sure they would be happy to provide childcare as needed, but I can’t help but feel that if they’re doing this now, that it may happen much more often once the baby is born and beyond.

1,"AITA for telling my sister to not practice playing the guitar during my visit? | It was my sister‘s birthday last Friday. Both my sisters and their boyfriends live in the same city, which is about an hour and a half drive away from me. They invited me and my s/o to stay the night at their place which we happily agreed to.


Growing up our parents never encouraged us to learn any instruments and were even lightly annoyed that we were a little too into arts for their taste. They’d preferred we focus on school.


Later on we all regret never having taken the opportunity for artistic development. I knew she wants to start learning an instrument now but it can be quite expensive. I heard from her boyfriend that she wants to learn to play the guitar so I decided to get her a beginner friendly one(s/o chimed in).


Needless to say she was ecstatic when she opened the present and it made me really happy. It was quite late into the night but she decided to look up some YouTube tutorials and practiced right there and then. Which was fine, she goofed around and had fun.


However the next day she’d use every free minute to practice. I was using my phone in the same room (hers), my other sister and her boyfriend were in their room and my s/o already left, the kitchen offers no space to hang out so I was stuck in her room. After about an hour it really got on my nerves. She was so into it she didn’t really notice how unnerving it got. She practiced the few same notes, the few same moves again and again, sometimes stopped to rewind the tutorial and went at it again. At some point I asked, after much consideration and in a polite tone, „Hey, can you postpone the practice session to a later point? It’s kinda getting on my nerves.“ She thought I was joking and ignored my request. I let her play for another 10 minutes and repeated my question. She ignored me again without a word. After 5 more minutes I raised my volume to make sure she can hear me „Hey, I wasn’t joking. Please stop for now, you can resume later in 3 hours after I have left!“


She got a little upset, mostly sad and countered disappointedly „If you hate it, why did you give it to me?“ and put the guitar away. I instantly felt bad because I have a really soft spot for my sisters. I said I‘d be glad to hear her play once she is confident with her skills but for now it was kind of annoying me. She looked so sad I caved and said that if she really wanted to, she could continue, I’d go for a walk or something. She said „no“ quietly and put the guitar away.


There were absolutely no hard feelings, her mood picked up half an hour later. I’ve been known to be a little tough, borderline asshole-ish (verbally) sometimes, I’ve tried hard for about 3 years now to be more considerate so I wonder if this was one of the situations where I should have held my tongue.

0,"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. 

I [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. 

6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. 

Now, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). 

I've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are ""cruel"". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.",False,False,4,3,1,2,3,4,Care|Proportionality
0,"AITA for refusing to apologize for telling my aunt to shut up about the year I forgot Mother's Day? | So bit of backstory here; my forgetting Mother's Day happened six years ago. I'm 22(f) now and was 16 when this happened. At the time, I was having a complete mental/psychotic breakdown caused by a medication I was taking. In all honesty, I don't remember much of what happened for most of that year and the year prior.  I'm doing great now, and my mom has long since forgiven me as, in her own words, she's just happy I'm alive and well. 

My aunt, however, doesn't seem to be able to let it go. 

We don't see my aunt all that often, maybe once or twice a year, but she brings up the Mother's Day thing every single time. My mom shuts it down any time she hears it, but unfortunately she doesn't hear her every time. I normally bite my tongue to keep the peace (a difficult thing, seeing as I wasn't exactly raised to keep my mouth shut), however, when she was at our house last weekend I kind of lost it on her when she made one of her usual comments. 

I flat out told her to shut up. I told her she had no idea what that year was like for me, or what it was like for my parents when they learned what I was going through. I told her that I even forgot my own birthday that year, because I didn't even know what day it was most of the time. Basically, I let out years of frustration that had built up with her snide comments. When I was done, I stormed off before I said something really nasty and stayed in my room until she left. 

The reason I'm asking if I'm TA is because, in the week since, I've had several people (mostly other family members) tell me I was out of line. My aunt's son (23), even called me to tell me to apologize, saying that she was only joking when she brought up Mother's Day and that she didn't know the extent of what I went through. Hearing this, I now feel extremely guilty about the way I reacted, but I still refuse to apologize unless she does so first. The way I see it, my mom shut her down repeatedly over the years, so she should have stopped mentioning it. I'm also beginning to feel like a dick for telling her to shut up.

&#x200B;

First a little back story, my mom and dad divorced when I was 3 and got split custody.  For 6 weeks every summer I would spent time with my dad but the rest of the time I was with my mom.  As a kid it was great, but as I got older, I started to see things you don't really notice as a kid.  For example he was 45+ years old and still lived with his mom, he couldn't hold down a job, he was almost $18,000 behind with child support, he complains about everything I have and do even though he has nothing of his own.  One year I decided to slack off in high school so I could stay with my friends instead of going to see my dad, and I figured if I used summer school as an excuse I didn't have to hurt his feelings because it wasn't ""my fault"" I couldn't go.

&#x200B;

The same year I didn't go see him I also signed up for the Army and as soon as I did that my father legally disavowed me.  He still talks to me and I still try to make things work with him but it stings knowing what he did.  Over the years he has come to visit (always on my dime)  but every time he comes to where ever I am stationed he does nothing but complain.  I am in Hawaii at the moment and last time he was here he said the beaches were to dirty (from natural things like tree nuts and sticks) he never wanted to do anything and shot down every idea my wife and I came up with.  Its to the point now that even my daughters (6, 4 & 4) understand that you can't make papaw happy.

Now the reason for the post,  someone he works with has a lot of airline miles and just gave my dad a free trip to Hawaii for Memorial day.  He called and told me this a few days ago saying when his plane lands that I will need to be there to pick him up, even though its in the middle of the work day.  When I told him I was working and there is no way I could get away  he told me he expected my wife to take my daughter out of school early and then go pick him up and that I could walk home from work to meet them at my house.  This was the last straw for me and I told him no and that if he shows up that I'm not coming to get him and he would have to find someone elses weekend to ruin.

0,"AITA For not tipping at counter/line service restaurants? | Backstory: I've been working food service for the last 18 years. Subway, Qdoba (chipotle), diners, to full bar fine dining, and everything in between. I have held every position from dishwasher to manager. I know these employees are overworked, often underpaid, no vacation, benefits, or sick leave. The shit we deal with day to day can be soul crushing. I know the industry and I understand the trials - and I always tip. Even on togo orders. 

So...In the last, idk, five years or so, the prevalence of the iPad POS systems has grown, if not ubiquitous. I'm talking about the kind of establishment where you walk in, order your food at a register, get given a number, sit down and someone brings you the order. While being rung up, *before* you have received any service or food, you are prompted to tip. Yes, you can always choose no tip, but there is sort of a public shaming incentive taking place as they flip the damn thing towards you and everyone waiting behind you carefully inspects your generosity...or lack there of. And really screw other people in line, I sortof feel like I'm giving the proverbial finger to the employees if I don't tip. (Not reccomend while dining out).

Anyways, that is my crux. AITA for thinking that a tip should be based on the services given *at the end* of your experience, not before I have even received my food? What if everything was terrible I and pressed the 22% button before I even sat down? I know there is a custom option usually, so I know I can just go less than whatever they reccomend, but even if I go below 20%, I feel that tinge of guilt from being in the industry for so long. Even when I was coming up, we didn't get (or ask) tips at these kinds of establishments. Usually you get paid more hourly than at a traditional sit down service joint. Alls I am saying is the point of the tip is to incentivize good service *prior* to finishing the experience. Instead, for these types of restaurants, it is simply a ""give me money"" fee upfront.

We do Christmas 'month' in our house so we randomly give little gifts or do random nice things for them in the spirit of ""Christmas month"" for all of December. 

I go to the school, security measures have been stepped up like crazy and I love that, sad to need it but anyways, the front office lady wanted to call him to the office but I declined and said I wanted to walk into class and see his face when he saw me.

He was super excited. Ran to me immediately. Big hug. Awesome shit.

I weighed the options immediately. Talk to the parents. Turn the other cheek. But then I thought no, my son is a fantastic kid, selfless, thinks of others, is always kind.

0,"AITA for working at a preschool that a kid I used to nanny for goes to? | This is a throwaway account. This is a long one, I’m really heated.

For the past 2 years, I have nannied for the same family fulltime. The family consists of Mom, Dad, 6-year-old, and 3-year-old. I decided to leave the position after going back to school full-time. To make the transition easy for them, I gave a 4 week notice. I agreed to come in a few times after my leave date to bridge the gap with their incoming au pair and to train for a few days. I even offered to write a “manual” that I could share with her. I also planned a transitional memory making activity with the girls to help them process my departure. 

During the time I nannied for them I started substitute teaching at the preschool that the 3-year-old goes to. I can choose when to work so it's perfect for school.

Last night, Mom and Dad told me they thought me working at the preschool in the future would seriously affect their kids.

Dad said, “We are telling the girls you’re leaving, but then you show up at the preschool and it’s hard to explain why you have time for the preschool and not for us. It’s probably hurtful for them. Especially because the 6-year-old goes to a different school and does not get to see you. We are not going to ask you or tell you to leave the preschool, but we would prefer if you left”. 

I appreciated the manner the Dad took in explaining their side. I totally understood where they were coming from. I offered some compromises so I didn’t have to leave completely, such as going to the school during times the 3-year-old wouldn’t be there, working at a different site, giving it a few weeks after I left before I started subbing again, and letting them know when I would be there so they could prime her. 

Mom was not happy with my ideas and became very emotional and upset and said, “Did you even stop to think about anybody else?”

This really hurt me in my core. My entire two years was me giving myself away to give for these girls and the whole family. I was a killer nanny: I worked for 12 hour days without a break, I worked the girls’ birthday parties, I would watch the girls AND their friends while the parents hung out with each other, I read the literature they gave me on my off time so I could learn about their parenting philosophy, I haven’t asked for a raise even though my responsibilities have changed, and I would stay past my end time so I could update them on the day. 

I’m torn because of course I care about the girl’s well-being, but I don’t want them to dictate my future. I believe that with enough explanations, processing, and time, they will come to understand the situation. They have had nannies leave before.

A few weeks prior to this, I was cleaning out my room at my parents and found two folders filled with Pokémon cards. I probably started this collection in 1999 and knowing that my partner's son likes Pokémon, asks him if its ok to give them to him when he's here. He loves the idea.

Yesterday, after we had a lovely day together, we gave him the folders and although it was from both of us, it was mentioned that it was my collection and I became super cool to a 7 year old.

I was cleaning in my kitchen with the door open (I have doors that slide all the way open and open up the kitchen straight into to the back yard) and music on, and had a just filled a bucket with boiling water and cleaning liquid.

I picked up the bucket and stepped backwards with it, but the cat had come in from the garden (didn't know it was there) and entered the house (which it never does), it was right under my feet and I tripped backwards, dropping the bucket.

Awfully, some the boiling water in the bucket spilled onto the cat (the screech was haunting) as well as burning my hand and wrist - but the cat got a lot more of it, almost directly on him.

The cat ran off, but I contacted my neighbours straight away before going to hospital. Later that night my neighbour knocked the door to tell me they had taken the cat to the vet and that while he would pull through, he had been seriously hurt and would be there for a while. I thanked them for letting me know, but was a bit surprised when she said that she expected me to pay the vet bills (they don't have insurance) which were likely going to be around £1,500 - £2,000 - as it was 'my fault'.

I mentioned how it was an accident, the cat had come into my house by itself and that I was also injured as a result and had missed work (unpaid) because of it. She started shouting at me how it was just my hand and it would heal, but the cat might not be the same again - that I should've considered that her cat could've been behind me (?) and that it was totally my fault.

I really don't think I should have to pay - but I do love animals and feel awful about it, so I'm not sure. What's the right thing to do? WIBTA if I didn't pay?

I literally have to roll him out of bed to get him to wake up. Sometimes I get so angry about this childish situation that I don't wake him up, because I feel like I am on the absolute edge of screaming at him or throwing shit at the wall (I literally sit in a corner and use my Headspace app for deep breathing exercises when I feel like this, I don't want to become an abusive person). But when I don't wake him up, he gets upset at me for ""letting him sleep through his alarms."" 

He swears he doesn't hear his alarm, which I don't understand - the alarm is often Heavy Metal turned all the way up in volume. Mornings are when I am most productive, and having to hear an alarm go off a dozen times really ruins my mornings and makes me anxious. He usually plays video games until 1 or 3 am every night, and claims that he is a night owl, hates mornings, and that sleep ""is wasted time."" I've never nagged him about his gaming habit or that it is probably why he can't wake up in the morning, and I feel resentful that he doesn't even consider the bad energy that his alarms and inability to wake up bring me almost every morning. I can't believe that it took me five years of dealing with this shit to reach a breaking point.

0,"AITA for putting my twins in different schools? | My twins, boy/girl, are entering high school this year. The two of them are not particularly close; they have definitely grown apart the past couple years. They each have their own friend groups, their own activities, they take different classes, far from being attached at the hip like they were when they were little. I think the fact they went to the same middle school contributed to a lot of rifts with them. They were heavily influenced by friends who would pick on the other twin (this went both ways; son’s friends would pick on my daughter for being “stupid” since she has a learning disability, daughter’s friends would pick on my son for being a “loser” for playing video games). There were lots of times they would come home from school fighting because of what happened at school. Generally, though, they’d get along better outside of school.

This year, my husband and I looked into other high schools in the area to see if it was possible to put them in different schools. We actually found that one school has a really great special education program, much better than our default school, that would be perfect for my daughter, since, as I said, she has a learning disability. We put in the request to transfer her there, unsure of whether the request would even be accepted, and we talked to the twins about it. Neither of them seemed to think much of it. Now, though, we’ve gotten word that the request was accepted, and the twins are both upset. My daughter says it’s not fair she has to go to a different school, my son says that he wanted his sister in high school with him. Ever since we found out that the request was accepted, the twins have been teaming up and trying to guilt us for splitting them up. 

I honestly didn’t think splitting them up would make them so upset. They’ve already been split up these past couple years as they were always in different classes and friend groups.

As it turned out, the fact that it was opening at all was controversial. I told my husband that I didn’t want to support it and I’d rather go to the zoos in our areas that we know are actually taking care of the animals, properly. He agreed.

He has one weekday a week off, so our oldest will stay home with him and they do something with him while the baby goes to daycare. I found out while at work, that they were at the aquarium/zoo that we had agreed not to go to. When I texted him, he said he had co-workers that had gone and it was perfectly fine. Yet, when I read reviews, there were reports of the animals biting the kids. Again, he didn’t even talk to me about this. He just took him. I was pretty pissed.

I told him not to bring him back and that this place was banned. My husband thinks it’s overkill, because they went and it was “fine”. I looked at the pictures. Those poor animals do not look comfortable and it does not look like your average aquarium/zoo, they’re way too cramped. My son said he didn’t have much fun either.

Now full disclosure during the night we were all smoking some weed.

My friend starting saying it was their choice if they wanted to drive and to mind my own business.

I tried explaining how it's not just his choice and that if I was to let him drive and endanger himself and others I would hold myself responsible too.

My friend then went out to his car and started it. I quickly ran out and stood out in front of the car and told him to go inside the house and just crash for a few hours.

A huge argument started with me repeatedly saying ""You're being stupid"" , ""Just crash for a few hours"" , ""stop being an idiot""

I said ""You're my friend and I can't let you do this, I'll stand out there all night"" to which he replied ""we're not friends"". He squared up to me and was repeatedly hostile and aggressive.

 I've been friends with this person for over 10 years starting when we were very young, probably 7 or 8. I've always been a bit heavier than my other friends, but that doesn't say much when most of my other friends are dancers and athletes. In fact, we've both always been usually the heavier people in the group until about 2 or 3 years ago when I lost 15 pounds and my BMI became around a 20. She was now the ""odd one out"" when it came to weight. 

 I recently entered a relationship while my friend has been pining for someone for a while. One day, she just straight out asked me, ""Why doesn't anyone like me?"" I explained that it wasn't her, it was them, and that being in a relationship should not define you. I thought it was the end of that. Turns out that instead, she became depressed and gained 25 pounds. She was now obese. I supported her until she got better, but her complaining just continued. 

 Recently, she's been trying to find clothes that she can wear to a party, complaining that everywhere she goes, nothing is in her size. One day, I got fed up and told her, ""Maybe you should try going on a diet or something."" She didn't take this lightly and accused me of calling her fat.

0,"WIBTA: Not returning a runaway animal to someone I suspect will kill it? | Obligatory throw-away account. 

So here's the setup, I live out in the sticks. Everyone has a few acres, tons of woods, wildlife galore, the works. My neighbors and I all share one long road as a driveway with houses jutting off every quarter mile or so. 

One of my neighbors I suspect is a poacher. He has deer feeders set up in his woods, salt licks and artificial water holes, all overseen by deer blinds and hunting positions in the trees. And every now and then you hear a gunshot and sometime later a car goes by with a fresh deer or some other animal mounted. And this happens at all times of the year, not just hunting season. And he's really adamant people stay out of his woods.

Now this happened a few days ago. It was a roasting hot 99, with a heat index in the triple digits. My two dogs start barking and are crowded around my front door, looking through the window. So I think maybe mailman or something. I open the door and Boom! A white rabbit hops in. My dogs immediately start to sniff it, but it completely ignores them, hops right past me to a water bowl a few feet away and starts to drink. After its had its fill it plops on the ground, panting, obviously close to overheating. My dogs just lay down right next to it as if he's a long lost litter mate. I go over and i notice the rabbit has a tag on his ear that just says ""17"". 

I suspect this little guy was either bred to be hunted for sport, or is bait for a fox/owl/something that people pay to release and then hunt the predator. And the suspected poacher lives a good 2 miles down the road. I suspect this little guy escaped, survived the trek to my house in the scorching heat and choose my house as a safe place. 

My neighbor has not put up any missing signs, or called or anything. I called my two nearest neighbors(poacher is about 4 houses down) and neither had a missing rabbit, and both agree likely its animal bait. 

My dogs love the rabbit, its very friendly and I'm seriously considering just adopting it. My aunt is a vet, so I can have the tag removed and get information on rabbits and just pretend I bought him legally. I would feel terrible going to check if he is in fact the suspected poacher and returning the poor thing, knowing he'd likely die.

She lives in another state so I haven't seen her in person for a couple years to be sure, but i see her in video chat and pictures at least once a month, and every time she seems heavier. I don't know her weight or bmi, and I don't know if she knows either. I also wouldn't ask for this information. From looks alone (which can obviously be heavily skewed, especially when you can't see them in person) I think she's at least obese at this point, and still seems to be gaining.

To my knowledge she hasn't had any health problems at all, but particularly not any due to her weight. Still, i worry there may be undetected health problems or that some may pop up if she continues to gain.

I have other reasons why I think i should probably keep my mouth shut, besides there being no known health concerns. 1, to my knowledge her weight is never discussed unless it's insults from her thin sister. I don't want to create any more insecurities or comparisons there. 2, I've had my own history with eating disorders (Anorexia with some binge/purge) and the last she saw me in person I was very underweight (now I'm a healthy bmi and in treatment, doing much better) so i worry that either she'll see how unhealthy I was and think I'm just a hypocrite or projecting my weight fears on to her or that I may ACTUALLY be projecting my weight fears on to her, or at least overly concerned due to my past.

I don't think I'm exaggerating her size when i see her, and I think my concerns may be valid, but I'm not sure if it's my place to voice these concerns or if it's ever helpful to discuss someone's weight.

I ask her why she’s mad she shouts “because I’m cooking and you come complain to me!” I keep quiet and keep frying the damn sprouts and no matter how much I try they’re still hard and raw in the middle so i learned WHY people roast them and that’s because it needs to be cooked over a period of time to cook it through. So I give up and take them off the heat and put them aside. 
When everything is done she puts all the sprouts on my plate. We sit down to eat and I’m intentionally avoiding the nasty bitter raw sprouts and she takes one off my plate and eats it and says “are they okay? they’re not very good” So I said “no I think they need more time to cook because the middle won’t cook fast enough.” And then she shouts “well how should I know?! You told me to wait for the rice to cook them so I waited and cooked them same time with the rice finished!”

I’m just so confused at this point so I’m like “what? What are you even talking about? No I mean frying them doesn’t work. Even when I fried them I couldn’t get them cooked it’s better to roast them!” And she answers back with “you didn’t you tell me to roast them?!” And I say “because at the time I didn’t know! I didn’t know you couldn’t really cook them through by pan frying them until I tried it!” And she still not getting what I’m trying to say answers back “it’s because you told me to wait for the rice!!” And I’m like “no! What I’m trying to tell you is that it doesn’t matter if you fried them 30 minutes ago or when the rice was done the result would be the same because they won’t cook through!” But halfway through that she cut me off and began yelling over me “it’s okay!

1,"AITA for getting a pet rabbit? | I've been with Julia (fake name) for 6 years, we've lived together for 4 of them and are expecting our first so things are tense.

I've got two children 7 and 12.

They've been begging for a rabbit for absolute ages.

To explain my garden; we've sectioned it into two parts, the nice part is at the back and the childrens section is at the front where they've got their toys and play area type thing.

Julia has a terrible phobia of everything that bites, she hates birds, rabbits, hamsters, dogs and can barely stand our cat - I don't know where she got the fear from but she's trying to move past it and if she sees a dog outside will interact when possible and used to take my youngest out to feed the birds, still does when she asks so she's attempting to move past it but it's a slow process.

I recently saw a gumtree advert for a rabbit, they wanted it gone that day and I knew it would probably end up as food if I didn't get it.

So, spontaneously I picked it up.

I plan on doing research on the rabbit later.

Julia flipped, calling me an insensitive AH because if she makes me rehome it she'll be the bad guy and on top of that what I've got is ""completely unsustainable"" 

I told her if it came to it we would rehome it's better than the rabbit becoming snake food?

Plus, the rabbit will go in the kids area so she won't have to interact and I'll care for it.

His PC is 7 years old and he's been wanting to upgrade for a while so he can play new games at high resolutions. I'm also a gamer so I understand the frustration of low FPS and ugly graphics however we bought a house last year and two months later he got fired so he wasn't eligible for employment insurance. I've had to pay for the bills for 6 months before he finally got a job again this year. During that time I paid for him to take a supplementary course to be more employable while paying for mortgage, his car payments, and literally every other bill. Luckily I have a good-paying job and an emergency fund so I was able to handle the financial burden. I was never mad at him for losing his job but I was upset and stressed that I was barely breaking even.

Anyway, he started working again on January and I told him to keep his earnings for a few months so he can start paying off his car (4 years left) and start saving. He makes around $2k/month and his only bill is his car payment of $500/month but he still only had $1k on his account before the refund was deposited. I don't know where the fuck his money goes but I didn't want to be controlling so I didn't push it.

Now with whats going on in the world and the industry we work in (oil) struggling, we're both at risk of losing our jobs. I asked him to hold off spending $2k on a new PC since we both might lose our jobs any time but he got mad at me because I spend my money however I want. This is kind of true but I also pay for all the bills, have zero debt, maxed out my registered accounts and set aside money for savings. I focus on our priorities first before I spend the excess on myself. If it's relevant, I make 3x what he makes and I spent $1k of my return on an exercise equipment (I've wanted to buy it for him) before I knew he wanted to make a new PC; the rest went to emergency fund. I just want him to have a cushion of savings for himself so that he doesn't need to rely on me financially if he were to lose his job. I do feel that it's unfair to him that I'm restricting how he uses his money but I think it's justified due to the current circumstances and I think that the refund is a great head start for him to save.

0,"WIBTA if I spent my weekend at a hotel eating pizza/watching Netflix? | My husband and I love camping and hiking. When we unexpectedly gained full custody of his children from a previous marriage, our habit of disappearing every other weekend into the woods had to stop. So we could both keep our sanity, we made a pact: each of us got to go by themselves (or with friends) 2-4 times a year. His daughters... do not enjoy being miles from a running tap or an iPhone charger :P so big family trips are out. These weekends are sacred to both of us; a chance to get away from everything and challenge ourselves in nature. Plus, the one who stayed home usually ‘goes easy’ on the one who went out on the Monday they return, handling most of the chores and childcare while the other recooperates. 

This worked quite well for a few years, and then we had our own baby. Husband waited 10 months before going hunting with some buddies. Now it’s my turn. But I find I don’t want to go hiking as usual because 

1. I’m exhausted like I’ve never been before. If I have a chance to get away, I honestly just want to recapture the days where I can play the Sims and eat pizza in my underwear, and no one needs me to do anything for them. 
2. My body has changed. Almost a year of being at home with baby has lessened my strength and flexibility, added fat, and generally knocked me down a peg. My favourite haunts are up rocky hills and thick Bush (were in Australia) and for the first time I’m... scared, actually. My pack feels so heavy. The other month I slipped on the steps of the local mall and twisted my ankle, like an old lady :( 

As you can probably tell, I feel kind of embarrassed about all this. I was thinking of telling my husband I was going hiking, but going to a nice hotel and chilling. But a girlfriend quickly pointed out that it would look like I was having an affair or something if the card showed a random hotel booking, and I do NOT need that. But I feel like he’ll feel put upon if he knows I’m just watching Riverdale eating BBQ wings, in a way he wouldn’t if I was sleeping on Mt Solitary, outside Katoomba.

0,"AITA for not inviting my boyfriend along when I hang out with my friends | This has been an ongoing argument between my boyfriend (M26) and I (F26) so we're bringing it to the internet to decide whether I'm being an asshole. He's read over what I'm writing and we're both going to accept the decision of internet strangers. For the record we live together.

I have always believed that when I'm hanging out with friends I should make an effort to sometimes go alone. This refers both to when I'm hanging out one on one with a friend and when it's a small group of us (like 3-4 friends from high school). When it's a larger group I always invite him. My reasoning for this is:

1. Just because they want to hang out with me doesn't necessarily mean that they want to hang out with my boyfriend at that time (for the record they like him). I feel like there are things that they maybe wouldn't feel comfortable sharing if he was there. 

2. Sometimes I feel like by bringing him I'm ""rubbing in their face"" or reminding them that they aren't in a relationship, and I know that some of them are actively looking. Also I remember how it felt when I was in their place and even though I was happy for them that they were happy I was also a little bit jealous and felt left out.

3. I think that a lot of times people get into relationships and lose touch with their friends. I remember how much it bothered me when I felt like I was losing my friend to a relationship or when they would invite me out but I felt like a 3rd wheel. It's important to me to keep making an effort in my friendships and not give my friends the feeling that they're ""in addition to my boyfriend"".

4. I feel like sometimes inviting my boyfriend changes the vibe of hanging out, and while that's totally fine, sometimes I feel like my friends want to just hang out ""the high school friends"" or ""just girls"". I feel like I also sometimes want this specific vibe. I remember how much it bothered me when I thought that I was hanging out with a friend and I showed up to see that her boyfriend had come along too, even if I liked him I was a little bit sad that we wouldn't have our own time together.

Overall I love my boyfriend and things are great when he comes along, but I feel that it's important for me to sometimes prioritize just friend things. This came up again today because I mentioned that I was going to meet with a friend tomorrow and my boyfriend got pissed that I'm not inviting him yet again, and he thinks that I'm taking my friends into account more than him.

I’m a man in my 30’s, just so you can get an idea. This old man kept dropping stuff and was looking around for someone. 

It was extremely noticeable he was distressed so I approached him and asked if he was ok. He said “I can’t find (name)” who was his wife. This is kind of the way the convo went. 

Him: She was just here, she doesn’t usually go far away from me. 

Me: Slow down. Who is (name)? Wife, daughter, granddaughter? I can’t help if you don’t provide more details. 

H: My wife! She had on a blue sweater and black pants. She is very short and fragile. 

M: do you know the last place you saw her?

H: (getting agitated) NO! Where is she?? I said where is she? 

M: Sir, please calm down. I don’t know who she is and am trying to help you, but I can’t help you with you yelling and screaming.

At this point he keeps dropping things and I pick them up. Conversation continues as we start pacing around the store. It’s almost empty, and no employees in sight. 

H: She forgets where she is, she needs to be found. 

M: Which is exactly what I am attempting to do. 

We find her on the other end of the store sitting on a chair which made it hard to see over the clothing racks. She barely speaks and seems tired or confused. 

M: Hi, your husband was looking for you. Are you okay?

M: Sir, you really need to be more careful. She seems like she is very confused. Please don’t lose her again, you might not be as lucky.

Gf invited me out, told me meet at her mom’s at 5pm. We’re there for a few hours having predrinks and a couple tokes before catching an Uber to the bar she wanted to go to. 
I had woken up late (noon) and hadn’t eaten at all during the day. I expected, since she asked me over for 5pm that we would be eating at some point after going out. Turns out the bar she wanted to go to doesn’t serve food. Great. 
So we have a few beers, her friend comes by for a pint during which time I may as well have not been there. Sure, she let me know that said friend would be joining us, but I mean I literally said no more than 10 sentences during the hour or so her friend was with us. 

The three of us got into a discussion about umami and what that actually meant. My gf said she thought it was a specific taste and flavor, to which I disagreed with saying that it was more of a  combination of taste, texture, and other things that make up personal preference. 

When she insisted that it was a specific flavor I said that what she was saying was didn’t coincide with what I had learned working under real chefs and called the whole industry, as well as her opinion, pretentious.

In doing so, I hurt her feelings and left her feeling very offended because she interpreted that to mean I was calling her pretentious.  

We talked back and forth for a bit while I acted quite unapologetic for calling her opinion pretentious. As a result, I got ditched at the bar that doesn’t serve food and now I have to find my own way back while simultaneously think of a proper apology to make it up to her.

She tried taking me to rehab to get fixed up, but I was stupid and denied to go. I believed it wouldn't do anything to change me so there was no point going and it was a waste of time. She threatened me so many times that if I don't change my ways, we would divorce. I promised I would, but I was that big of an addict to just continue doing what I done.

My wife eventually had enough and packed her bags, took our 3 kids (15M, 11F, 8F) and moved out from my house to her brother's house. And I tried to get her back, but she refused and that was that. We divorced, and she used my drinking habit to get full custody of our children. I cannot mention how devastated and heartbroken I was, but I guess I have no one to blame but me for my stupid, idiotic actions and demeanor. 3 years later, she moved on and remarried another man and I decided to remain single. I've managed to get a grip and stop my unhealthy habit, but a little too late unfortunately.

My kids, with my ex-wife's permission of course, still come over and visit me once every few months and they still love and miss me despite being fully aware of what happened. They tell me how their step-dad isn't the same, how torn apart they are and how they want the ""good ol' days back with mum and I"".  I can't help but hate myself whenever I hear them talk about this. After 3 years, I finally felt I owed something to my ex and kids after how I abandoned them.

I didn't press the issue and waited. I was about to hang up and take it as a no, until her current husband picked up and told me to f*** off and how disrespectful I am for calling his wife.

It didn’t sink in until I got home, I locked myself in our bedroom and had been crying for hours. Abortion came to mind, I’m so afraid of this huge responsibility. I’m 37 and I’m afraid to outlive my kid who has a disability. I want to have a child so bad but at the same time I feel like it’s going to be unfair for him/her to live such disadvantageous life. Even if I leave my work and devote myself to him/her, what if I’m not enough?

Found my husband at his study researching about Down syndrome. I started out with “Maybe now is not a good time but do you think abortion is an option? It’s only been three months”. He flipped out, first time I’d seen him really mad. He was so frustrated because he didn’t expect me to suggest that. He wanted to keep the baby and said that nothing is going to change with our plans. I got mad because he didn’t hear me out at least. He called me names and I did the same. I feel so dehydrated from crying all-day, my head hurts and my husband went out to clear his head and hasn’t come back.

She said that she saw the gift as an implication that she should clean more. She hates cleaning and she thought the gift was very inappropriate for a birthday.

I met Greg about 5 years ago. We dated for about 2 months before I broke it off. We were a terrible match; the two words I'd use to describe us together would be ""awkward"" and ""angry"".

Since then I got married and had kids. 6 months ago Greg reached out and told me I was the one who got away. I was flabbergasted to find this out because I  honestly do not think of Greg at all. I was clear with him over the phone that I moved on completely and had no interest in Greg. He said he understood and was sorry to have waited so long. I made sure to emphasize my message by texting him after the call that it was nice to catch up but I have no interest in rekindling anything and that I'm happily married.

He texted back asking if we could stay in touch as friends. I acquiesced, mostly because I figured we were going to lose touch and I'm never going to see him.

Since then we texted a few times a month about very innocent things. Stuff like how is work going, did you see the news, etc. I have reread the texts and they are completely innocent. We never moved past the superficial topics. 

Well. Greg passed away suddenly a few weeks ago. And apparently left everything to me. It's quite a sizeable amount.

Greg had no kids, was never married. He does have a mother and 2 siblings.

His will was painfully clear but offered no explanation to his decision. His mother and siblings are, for lack of a better word, livid. We had a few nasty exchanges. To be clear, I don't think they're angry because they want his money. They sound very upset that they've been out of the loop on his decision. They sound deeply hurt and I can't blame them. I mean really, who am I here? I'm literally some chick he dated for 2 months 5 years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if his family is trying to find a away to intervene.

1,"AITA for getting my grandsons hair cut?? | This obviously isn't from today but it came up and had me wondering if I really did do something wrong. I have a 2 year old grandson with hair that grows insanely fast. His hair was past his shoulders when he got his first haircut at 4 months old. My daughter is super picky about hair. She pretty much refuses to try out new hairstylists unless necessary and once she finds one she likes won't see anyone else.


Well his hair was starting to get pretty long and messy because he hadn't had a haircut in a while, she said she didn't have the money at the moment but would get it cut when she did anytime I mentioned it. I asked if I could take him to get it cut, and she said only if I use his stylist. It's at this one kids place and after tip the haircuts are nearly $30. I said I didn't want to spend that much on a 2 year olds hair and that I'd take him to the place I usually go.


She refused to let me take him if it wasn't hers, so I dropped it. A bit later, we watched him while she was sick, and she had a prescription she asked if we could grab for her. I figured to pass the time waiting for the medicine I'd go get the him a haircut. I took him to my stylist, since they only charge like $10 for kids.


Well she wasn't used to cutting childrens hair. She had a hard time cutting it with him moving around so much, and ended up just doing the best she could. It wasn't horrible, but it was fairly choppy and uneven. There was no way she was going to be able to fix it though because he kept pulling away and trying to push the scissors away.


Anyways, when we took him back home she freaked out the second she saw him asking what the hell we did to her child's hair. I told her I took him to get his hair cut, and she said that this is EXACTLY why she said not to in the first place, now her sons hair is all screwed up and they cut it too short to even be able to take him to get it properly fixed elsewhere without shaving it all off. She was nearly in tears over it. I told her I was simply trying to help out because his hair was getting too long and messy, but she didn't want to hear it. Every time I saw her or talked to her after that, she would make a comment about how awful his poor hair looked and she sure hoped it hurried and grew out so she could get it cut properly. 


She did get it cut later on, and even during that haircut she was telling the stylist about how I didn't listen to her last time and let someone screw his hair up. Well she just told me ""just so you know, when this is over with, you are NOT getting his hair cut. He can wait until I can take him, even if it's a month or so after I have this baby."" 


I thought it wasn't a big deal, but she's still mad, her husband actually seemed upset about it, and my wife got mad at me too, and the hairstylist laughed at me and said ""yeah, grandpa lost his privileges to take him for haircuts with that screw up!"" when they were talking about it.

Rather than immediately getting out of there I instead decided to talk to her and help her through whatever it is that she was dealing with because I didn't feel right leaving that situation not knowing what state of mind she was in. We talk on and off for a few weeks about nothing in particular, she has several panic attacks and remissions that I talk her through, we find out we go to the same campus, I go to lunch with her and a friend of hers. I find out that she's on some sort of medication and during that whole lunch she is super loopy and borderline dissociative. At this point I start to feel particularly shitty about the whole situation, because I don't feel any attachment or obligation to this girl, but in talking to her through the things she is going through I begin to feel guilty over the idea of not wanting to burden myself with it.

She says she took a bunch of pills and feels numb and that cutting herself is the only thing that helps her feel and begins doing so over the phone to me. I'm obviously freaking out at this point and trying to console her and stop her from doing that because I can't actually do anything for her.

While I was in college and grad school, I gained a total of 50 pounds, which I know is a lot. I admittedly don't handle stress well, and eat a lot when stressed.  I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but there was a period of a few month in college when I first started gaining where I would feel extremely guilty after I ate and throw up.

I assumed he just wanted one, but instead he held the chip an inch or two in front of my face and half-yelled, ""What is this?"" a couple of times. I turned my head away, and he moved it so it was in front of my face again and did the ""What is this?"" a couple more times. I recognized this as the same thing he does when our dog gets into the garbage.

My fiancée does not have a good relationship with her family because of how abusive they were to her when she was younger and I think she got this cat to start her new life and not be alone. Honestly I’m not really a fan of cats, yes she was sweet but I tolerated the cat because my fiancée adored her. Well yesterday my fiancée started crying a lot, for like 3 hours straight, I’ve never seen her this upset, she’s cried before but never to this extent. I consoled her and held her yesterday and I tried to cheer her up this morning by showing her a puppy we might be able to get soon. She started crying again, and all I said was that she’s just too sensitive if looking at puppy is making her cry again. She just apologized and went to our room and has been distant for the last few hours. I told my sister what happened and she told me I’m kind of an asshole for saying that to her. I didn’t mean it in a mean way, it’s just her personality is like that. Well am i the asshole for telling her she’s sensitive?

0,"AITA for wanting to rest for a week doing nothing ? | First of, 2019 hasn't been easy on me at all, I've lost 2 family members, had big ass drama with my girlfriend and almost quit school because of depression. I then started a job right after college, no break between school and work. I have worked all summer every morning, 5 days a week 9 hours a day to afford my second year of college. I start at 7am and end at 5pm. My job is very physical and I am completely exhausted when I come home, which means I usually get to sleep at around 9pm, giving me roughtly 4 hours of free time everyday. Then I wake up at 6:30am and the cycle continues.

Now, school for me starts in 2 weeks. I was supposed to work next week but decided I couldn't handle it and basicaly told my boss that I wasn't going to come, he was okay with it but I wouldn't get paid, of course, which I'm fine with.

Before I continue, I wanna say that for my age (18), I am in a very good financial state. I really do not have to worry about money and I could pay for college without having to work.

So, I was going to use this one week break to rest and litteraly do nothing at home, sleeping and doing personal stuff, away from everyone. When I told my mother about why I needed that rest, she got mad at me and told me I was being lazy and antisocial, that people my age would rather go hiking or doing stuff outside than staying inside and doing jack shit and also that I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED the 600$ I was supposed to make that week ( which is honestly not true). She said that everyone works and goes to school and all you need to get some rest is sleeping at night. 

This makes me really sad, since I absolutely need to rest or I won't be able to perform in college, but I also do not want to upset her since she's my mom and I love her.

I just want one week being a lazy ass and not having to do anything with anyone. Am I asking for too much ? Should I just continue working and shut up about my problems and my need to rest ?  Thanks for reading.

Also sorry english isn't my first language.

Throwaway because my boyfriend (22M) is on reddit too.

A few days ago I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to come, and he did, except he stays and comes to the same room daily now. I have expressed to him in the past that I find it really distracting to have someone really close to me working in this space (one of my best friends recently came for 2 days in a row and I found it hard to work after the first day). I know it's a weird mental thing I have, but I guess I get distracted too easily, even if I 'can't even see him', as he brought up. I suggested he go to another room, I checked and there was enough free space. He got quite annoyed at me over text (I wasn't in the library at this point) and said I need to just get over it, he's stressed too, not everything is about me. He is right, we are both stressed and it is just a stupid thing I have. 

I thought I should probably get over it and I wanted to meet for 5 mins to chat because I thought it would be better to communicate things in person and compromise, but he said he didn't want to waste time given he woke up late today and I think he is already annoyed about that. I get his whole point of I can't see him so why should I get distracted and he had his folders set up so he just wanted to get on with work, and I'm starting to think that I am way too particular.

0,"AITA for keeping 50/50 money I won at a benefit? | My friend's father was dying of cancer and his family doesn't have a lot of money. They were struggling to pay hospital bills and also had to think about a funeral and headstone in the future as his dad was not getting better. These were the days before GoFundMe, so they had a spaghetti dinner benefit for him, where you paid for a plate, paid for a dessert, and they had a 50/50 and a Chinese auction. 

We spent money on everything. At the time, my husband and I were fresh out of grad school with shitty entry-level jobs, so we were really struggling financially. Loan payments were coming in on top of our living expenses, so we were incredibly aware of every dollar we spent. This was absolutely a no-brainer for us though and we didn't feel any anxiety about spending money here for our friends.

So as the night wore on, it came time to pull the names for the 50/50. I won. I can't actually remember how much money it was, but I think it was between $200-250. My husband and I were happy about winning obviously, because of our financial situation. Any little bit helped at that time. I was feeling a little guilty about winning since I knew it was a benefit and that their family really needed the money. I asked my husband if we should give the money back to them, or even donate some of the money back to them. We technically wouldn't miss the money since we didn't have it in the first place and the only reason we had it was luck. We kinda went back and forth but eventually settled on keeping it due to us being broke young adults. We did really struggle with the situation and only kept it because we were behind on bills at the moment.

After the raffles, people started to leave. We were sitting with our friends and heard a few family members say things like ""I was hoping to win the 50/50 because I was going to give you guys the money back,"" while giving us pointed looks. That made us feel even worse, but this money would really help us so we stayed put in our decision. When we left, I felt sick with guilt and called my mom for advice. She said that it was a 50/50 and if they didn't expect the winner to keep the money then they should have just had a donation bucket instead of a 50/50. She also knew our financial situation and said that we really needed the money also, and that we should keep it. That made me feel a little better, but I still felt guilty because I thought my friends might be mad at us. I don't know if they were or not, but we kept the money. AITA, Reddit?

TLDR: My friend's dad was dying of cancer and they needed money for hospital bills & funeral costs. They had a benefit with a 50/50 and I won the money.

I recently moved to California for awhile to pursue college and build up the relationship with my family out there
My mom, step dad, and step sister are all cool but no matter what happens, I cant find it in me to want to associate with my brother anymore (male. 20)
Like
He always yells,  calls people names, is asking for money to cover his  car insurance Bill's but spends all of his money on games and drugs
Eventually it got to the point where he spent his entire college fund on microtransactions on GTA V
He lied about where it went saying it went into stocks but it eventually came out he was hiding it

As kind of a 1 time bailout thing, I took a personal loan out for him so he could continue going to college since he wanted to keep going and paid for the semester he owed and the following
Turns out that he wasnt even going to any of his classes and had literally a 0 percent grade in each of his classes and I just wasted my money. Ontop of that. He consistently says I dont do anything for him when I wont help him with getting rides to his ""plugs"" and telling him how to ""give a girl a miscarriage without her knowing ""

He started doing drugs and blowing me off and actually damaged my car so I cut him off for awhile
Eventually,  he got into a really bad accident because he was texting and driving and broke his femur and totaled his car
I was there for him as a person because I hoped maybe this life changing event would actually change him
My mom got him a car with and he only had to pay his insurance. 
She stayed up every night for hours and home from work to make sure he was doing okay and on the correct meds and he was being taken care of
It didnt really matter to him. He started giving her attitude for dumb things
Like, my mom wouldnt allow drugs in the house because of my step dads work, or for him to be out after 2am without letting my mom know whatsup .

He started calling her names and cussing at her and etc. 
Eventually, it got really bad to where she found cocaine and other hard drugs in his backpack along with a machete and another club like weapon
My mom took that to the police and kicked my brother out 
My brother reacted by getting his friends to try and intimidate my mom by harassing her at her home and work and following her around
The police actually had to get involved
Eventually,  my brother apologized and my mom took him back with open arms but I'm not budging
I dont want him in my life and I think its awful.how he treats everyone there and walks all over everyone

0,"AITA for getting upset at my sister for throwing out my cactus? | A few months ago, I lost my cat to something unknown, we didn't get an autopsy. She was a huge help for my depression and meant a great deal to me. My sister was even the one who drove us to the animal hospital and saw my distress as I realized she wasn't going to make it. Shortly afterwards, a friend of mine got me a cactus to help me feel better, which was also in coincidence with my cactus dying. Anyone that knows me knows that I love cactuses too. Not too long after that, another friend of mine also got me a cactus. Here I was, moved by my friends with my two cacti while I mourned my cat. 


Skip to yesterday and I get a text from my older sister: ""I broke your cactus, sorry."" I called her and asked her what happened, to which she replied: ""You put them in a bad place, and I bumped into one. It broke, so I threw it away.""


I thought she meant she threw the pot away, considering both my cacti are less than 3 inches tall and wouldn't be terribly bothered by a short fall. Turns out, she threw the cactus itself away. I wasn't home at the time and I didn't want to argue over the phone so I remained calm and asked her why she threw it away. She thought it wouldn't survive. I was a bad mix of heartbroken and pissed off inside. Both of my cacti mean a lot to me. Not only do they remind me of my cat, but they remind me that people outside my family do care about me; these gifts were probably the most thoughtful I've ever been given, especially in a time where I felt extremely insignificant.


Luckily she only threw them in the kitchen garbage, not the outside bin. When I got home, I dug Barnaby out of the garbage and put him in a new pot. I didn't ask my sister to dig him out because I knew she wouldn't. When I asked her about what happened, she was firm about stating that I shouldn't have left my cacti where I did and that it was my fault it broke.


Barnaby is in a temporary plastic pot now until I get a new one, and both my cacti are in a safer spot. When my sister got home today, I vented to her that I was hurt how little she cared for something that she knew was of great importance to me. Her only apology was the ""sorry"" at the end of her text. She got upset with me saying I was overreacting and that it's fine, nothing bad happened. I tried to explain again multiple times to help her understand my frustration but she became more agitated every time until she told me she ""never wanted to hear the word cactus again"" and that I was attacking her. I feel awful when she says that because nobody deserves to feel cornered in their own home. She said I was only mad because a couple weeks ago I asked her to take out the recycling for me because I'd forgotten and it was Sunday night, and I'd taken out the trash for her earlier that day before I left. She said she would take it to the bin, but not out to the curb because I hadn't taken the garbage to the curb (it wasn't garbage week).

My grandfather (my mum's dad) told my mother's brothers that if they continued a relationship with my mum, they would be cut out of the wills. The younger brother decided not to speak to my mum to ensure his inheritance. As time has gone on, the extended family is more accepting of us, we are invite to and attend family gatherings and are all cordial but we don't socialise otherwise, with the exception of my now deceased grandma who loved my dad and mum and me and my sister had a wonderful relationship with her.

Previously it had been about 7 years since we had seen or spoken to my uncle. When my grandma died we went to her house to pay our respects - there was maybe about a dozen people there. My uncle said hello to us but other than that completely ignored us (we were all sitting around a table). After about an hour, my uncle looked at me and said ""you've really packed on the pounds, you used to be so pretty"" in front of everyone. I'd always been very slim (50kg) but having gotten a bit older I'd started to struggle to keep the weight off, been diagnosed with an automimmune disease which causes weight gain and a few months earlier I'd had an accident which left me bed ridden for 8 weeks so I couldn't work out. I knew I'd put on weight already and didn't need it pointed out. I became tearful and my mum, dad and sister started defending me but he didn't really see why that had been rude he just said ""but it's true, look at her"". No other comments were made after this.
Fast forward a year later to my grandfather's funeral. I've lost 20kgs, am on medication that helps regulate my metabolism and I'm now in a happy place with my weight. My uncle approaches me while I'm with my parents and sister and immediately says ""you look great, see all you needed was a bit of motivation"". I was furious that again, the only comment was about my weight and we were at a funeral service, so I calmly and pointedly said ""why are you so fascinated by my body?"" He was like a deer in the headlights, stuttered and walked away. My mum and dad didn't care that I said anything.
No-one else heard the conversation but later on my mum got a phone call from my uncle's wife saying I'd been disrespectful and insinuated he was a pervert. My mum would like me to apologise just to put the whole thing to bed but I just don't want to.

I have been working as a restaurant manager for over 10 years but in September this year started at a new place as a deputy manager to take a step back from the stress of being the general manager. My last general manager job caused me to end up in a deep depression & so I thought I’d be better off as a deputy.

Turns out I was wrong. My job started off great with a promise of having at least 2 evenings a week free, one night so I could play my sport (which helps keep my mental health in check) & I helped the GM with all the rotas & was given lots of praise for the job I have been doing. Recently I haven’t been getting any evenings off in the week, my shift patterns are usually 3-close, 12-10 or 12-close, meaning I’m only free to do anything else on my days off (i.e. see friends, see my boyfriend, see my family, Christmas shopping, tidy the house etc) & worst of all I have been put to work on the days I play my sport, my team aren’t particularly happy with me! 

On top of that my general manager is an AH. He never says hello as we come in, he never thanks anyone for their hard work even though all our reviews have been amazing, he constantly is moaning or telling people off for things that most of the time aren’t even wrong, they’re just not his way (his way changes every week we will never get it right) & people are now fearful of coming to work as they know they will be shouted at as soon as they walk through the door.

Only recently have I managed to end up in his bad books (reasons unknown I have been doing my job the same way since the start). He has undermined me on the rotas, twice now after I spent hours of my time doing them he has then scribbled them out in front of my face & said I have been too nice to staff so he will re-do them. I accepted I would be working all over Christmas because I know the industry but asked if I could maybe not do the whole day Christmas Eve or start a little later on Christmas Day to spend a small amount of time with my family, instead he actually extended my shifts from what I had suggested they could be. He also extended some of my other shifts that week meaning I was working all day on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day & the 2 days after that as well, no time to see my family or my heavily pregnant sister who would be visiting. 

I could go on forever about the things he has done to me lately but long story short, I’m now having daily panic attacks about going to work & have had to return to my GP for help with my depression. Both the GP & my parents think the job is not worth my happiness but I know the staff (who I think are all great btw it’s just the manager who isn’t) will be short over Christmas without me & the GM may have to cancel his holiday he has booked from Boxing Day.

Every time we try to talk to her about her behaviour after a couple of drinks, she feels its nog our place. Or says we are overreacting. Often she just gets annoying and laughs at her own terrible (and sometimes hurtful) jokes.But I feel I just don't trust her. As normal talking does not help, would making demands make a difference?

1,"AITA for showing concern about my girlfriend’s breast implant scars? | Hey. I (19M) have been with my girlfriend (18F) for half a year now. We met in college. She said she has wanted a breast augmentation for years. I didn’t judge whether she needed one or not. I trusted her to make the right decision for herself. She didn’t turn 18 until last November so she couldn’t get the procedure done until winter break. I’m glad she didn’t go too big. They look fine, but there are very long and noticeable horizontal scars on the underside of her breasts. I’m sure that’s normal and will fade eventually. 


However, before we parted ways in March to spend the isolation with our respective families, her scars still looked very noticeable. I’m not sure they even started to fade from the handful of times she let me see her naked. She wouldn’t let me get too close to them. I’m guessing her shortage of breast tissue coupled with the implants stretched her skin too thin, but still I need them to heal quicker so she wouldn’t be so protective of her breasts, even to me. She said she is diligent though about applying aloe vera gel and petroleum jelly to the scars to help heal them more efficiently. 


I haven’t asked her about the scars since we parted ways until yesterday. We were video calling and the thought of her scars popped up. I told her I missed her body (I really do) and to show me her breasts. She showed me and I noticed that her scars are still so noticeable even with the poor resolution. I asked her when those scars are expected to become less noticeable. She said perhaps a few more months. I said that I hope they’re faint by the time we meet again. I’m guessing that’s sometime in the summer but who knows. She told me to not give her any more stress. I don’t know what she means by that. Our lives are pretty chill right now and our families are all healthy. 


I told her that I’m not trying to stress her out, but that her scars should have healed a bit quicker than they have by now, considering that many of my large open wounds from my childhood healed much more quickly from what I can remember. She told me that everyone heals differently and to stop being so insensitive. I apologized and told her to not forget to apply her gels. She seemed angered by what I said. She told me to stop being so irritating. I guess she didn’t want to talk about her scars so I started talking about something else.

0,"WIBTA for trying to interfere with my sister getting a siberian husky? | So my sister (21) recently ""moved"" into a newly build top floor flat in my parents house together with her boyfriend (29 ish?). We usually get along great and there isn't a lot of tension but a week ago my mother informed me that my sister is thinking about getting a dog, a siberian husky to be precise. 


I immediately thought how bad of an idea that was, mainly because I don't think she is in a situation where she can provide a good living for such a demanding breed. 

First of all she is a student finishing up her Bachelors in an engineering field while her boyfriend is starting as a firefighter. The firefighting job is a super stable position in germany, but he also has to work 24h shifts (1day on 2 days off), while she has to finish up some mandatory internships and then either continue with her masters degree or find a job somewhere. So I don' think theyll have the time to properly work out with the dog. She just can't tell her internship jobs ""Hey my bf is working today so I need to stay home and watch the dog"".


Then there is the issue of space. The flat size is somewhere around 60m² and while she also has garden access, the garden directly borders on neighbours gardens without a fence (just some plants to obstruct the view) so she cant let the dog out without close supervision. 


And also there's the climate in germany, which while it's not super hot we also had extended periods of 35°C+ in the last years and she has no AC in her top floor flat, so thats going to be really uncomfortable in the summer. 


I tried to talk to her about that (making clear it is specifically about the siberian husky) but she just told me to shut up and not interfere in her live. It's not my place, she already considered everything and still thinks its fine to get this dog. I think she's right - I should not interfere in her life - but I'm not doing it to spite her, but to stop her from ruining a dogs life. Nobody in my family ever owned a dog and I don't know why she's so hellbent on this one particularly difficult/demanding breed now. I also talked with my gf (her family always had and still has dogs, but she doesn't because we can't provide for them atm) who is also strongly opposed to the idea of any dog for them (I wouldn't go that far). I am considering trying to talk my parents out of letting her own a husky, since they are technically her landlords and could forbid her having a dog (or this specific dog) in her flat.

I had never purchased from her before but had a rough day at work so I decided to treat myself. 

I was just reading the menu when a girl maybe in her 20s approached me and said excuse me. Honestly I couldn’t tell for sure if she was homeless or not. I looked at her and she didn’t say anything so I just went back to the menu. She said excuse me again so I said she could go before me if she was already ready to order. Then she said, “Actually I’m homeless and was wondering if you would get me a little cake.” 
I became super uncomfortable in that moment. 

Living in London, I’m used to being near homeless people. When they go car to car in the tube asking for money, I usually give them some because they’re always polite and it’s a gamble to spend money to ride the tube in hopes of getting more. 

But I was so uncomfortable with being approached by the girl in the middle of ordering my food and being asked if I could get her some as well. I felt like I was specifically targeted and trapped. (I get targeted for various reasons in the city regularly because I go places alone, I look much younger than my actual age, and I’m quite short and thin.) 

I ended up telling the cake lady maybe I’d come back another time and walking away from the situation. Obviously I wouldn’t tell the homeless girl I couldn’t buy her a cake and then turn to proceed to buy myself one, but I was completely turned off by how rude she was in her approach.

That's where I'm at right now. 

I could go on dramatically and bore everyone so I will try and keep this simple. Three years ago I broke up with a guy who literally checked every box I have because he was in the Navy and moving and I felt like I owed to myself to finish grad school. I decided that if I kept in touch with him in any way I would drop everything and willingly become a happy housewife so I changed my number, deleted all social media and got on with the business of getting over him. Call him Charlie. 


Fast forward to last week, I work in a large office complex and evert single day this very sweet, cute guy walks past our front door and we wave. We've chatted a few times so I know his name. On Wednesday he very nervously asked me out and he was just so nice and earnest and sweetly awkard that I said yes. 


We went out last night and I was having a nice time but was like MAYBE there's possibility here but I liked him as a person. I went to the bathroom and ran smack into Charlie's parents. They always loved me and when they said that Charlie had just moved back into town for his next assignment, my knee's literally got weak. His mom asked for my number and without even thinking I gave it to her. I said goodbye and rejoined my date. 


It wasn't even 15 minutes and Charlie texted me ""is this really you?"" I texted back ""yes"" and then he asked where I was. I told him I was at a restaurant and he asked if he could come pick me up. Again without even thinking I said yes. I told my date that I was having a family emergency and that was the reason for the texts. He offered to give me a ride home. I told him that it was ok and my brother was coming to pick me up. I said I was so sorry and I paid for our entire meal but he insisted on waiting with me out front. When Charlie pulled up and it was the first time I'd seen him in 3 years I again got weak in the knees. I told my date that he was my brother but I could absolutely tell by the look in his eyes he knew I was lying but he was way too nice of a guy to call me out on my bullshit. 


Of course it was instant chemistry with Charlie and after playing an hour of catch up we were back at my house doing what we did best. Only he's such an amazing such an amazing guy he said he wanted to slow down a bit and not take it all the way, instead he tucked me in and left with a kiss on the forehead. He's on his way over now to take me to a champagne brunch. I'm ready to drive to vegas and get married and never say goodbye to him again.  


But enough of the school girl gushing and back to the problem. I feel AWFUL for what I did to my date last night. I don't know what to do or say to him and I know I'm going to see him tomorrow. I guess to help me know how to plan for tomorrow, I guess finding out if I am a light asshole, a major asshole or even some small chance NTA would be very helpful.

Her birthday was last week. In the months and weeks running up to it, when I’d ask her what she’d want for a gift, she kept telling me she only wanted a card. Like, one of those custom made ones, for example. When I’d reply and tell her that she’s got to want more than just a card, she’d firmly state that was all she wanted. She said that cards were more sentimental to her and that they had long-time value unlike presents. 

The thing is, I really don’t see the point in cards. I get why she would like a custom made one, but we have tons of framed pictures of us together. I’d just be recycling photos we already have on display. I’ve never got her a card before and she’s never complained or brought it up. 

I ended up buying her a new laptop as hers has been faulty for a while. I was super stoked about the present and thought she would be, too. On her birthday, when she found a wrapped present, she was immediately pissed. When she opened it, she was even more angry. Told me that it wasn’t my responsibility to fix her electronics and that she is perfectly capable of deciding when her laptop should be replaced. She asked if I had got her a card and I said no. I told her that I had spent enough money on the laptop and I didn’t see the point in spending another £7+ on a custom made card. She hasn’t spoken to me since. 

She’s been staying with some friends who all live in a shared house and I cannot understand why this is such a big deal.

Admittedly, I’m much better at the game than she is, but she has gotten much, MUCH better over time, and is able to hold her own in most situations.

Anyway, we were playing recently when I was “downed” by some nearby enemies (basically, I got shot, but was still alive crawling on the ground).

My neighbour has a 'ground covering' plant on either end of the footpath leading up to his house, and he doesn't often trim it back, so its always spreading onto the pavement. He also parks his car outside his house, again half on the road and half on the pavement, so I can't get through. His son does the same. For me to go around his car I would have to go in the middle of a very busy road, which would be very dangerous.

I have had numerous polite conversations with him, asking him to cut back the plants and park more responsibly but he never listens and the other day he responded with a really bad attitude and slammed the door on me. He says that he doesn't want to park entirely on the road incase his car gets damaged and that he can't cut the plants back at the moment because that would cause them to die. Stupid, crap excuses.

My entire family (mum, bro, myself) was hostage to my father's moods. He spent his time isolating us, bullying us, gaslighting us, screaming at us for hours until we cried (or threw up in the case of my brother), throwing landline phones or chairs at my mother (but never actually hitting her, which used to make me think this wasn't *really* bad), and more, until the divorce.

When i hit puberty it became even nastier so I refused to see him and he'd call me a 100 times a day until hearing the phone ring would make me retch, stand in front of my mum's building for hours, scaring the neighbours and occasionally breaking the glass door.
As an adult I went to see him twice a year which led to tons of guilt tripping (5 min after getting to his place for xmas: ""so what do you want to eat next year xmas when you come again?""). I told him I wouldn't take any insult directed at my mother, he'd say ""you know it's not your mum's fault if she is stupid"", which he was really adamant did not qualify as insulting her.

Because I'm petty as hell, what truly prompted me to cut ties was that whenever I opposed him, he'd act as if he was proud of me for ""standing up for myself"".
I realised he was trying to turn this into a ""I made you tough"" narrative and I was not having it. I ghosted him. He sent me 4 letters that all start with ""Well I dont know what I did to you but I'm sorry"". They were promptly binned.

*The twist*: my father has a severe undiagnosed mental illness which contributed to making him this way, notably by ""making him"" an alcoholic, leading to him being unemployed for almost his entire life. I have this same mental illness but much less severe, so I know what it's about. Regardless, he still made the choice to torture us, and not by accident: he brought my mum into his country only to forbid her to learn the language. He then was obsessed with only having daughters (because women are weak and easily controllable, amirite), when my brother was born he was so mad he didn't hold him for the first 6months of his existence. My brother took his 1st steps because my father was screaming and he was trying to get away from him.

What I'm thinking is I dont need to forgive anyone! I moved on and this is not part of my life anymore. Speaking to him means teaching him about how much of an ass he is and trying to make him see the light. I feel the efforts would be at 90% coming from me and I'm over this, not a project I am interested in. Besides, would it not be better for him to die alone not knowing - he isnt even really alone because my brother is a selfless angel and takes care of him.

TLDR; My father made my childhood a nightmare but partly due to an undiagnosed mental illness.

0,"WIBTA if I (24f) reported my (ex) Therapist for unethical behavior? | Over the past few years, I was really struggling with my mental health. I was unmotivated, depressed, extremely anxious, and having bursts of anger. 
So a few months ago, I decided it was finally time to seek outside help. Which brings me to the therapist.

(I have since been diagnosed with ADHD and a mood disorder- not by the therapist)

At the end of my first session with the therapist, I was bothered when they forced me to hug them at the end and said “you’ll get used to it”. I’m not comfortable with physical touch.

I kept going to the sessions bc 1. I wanted to give them a chance and 2. I was finally getting help and did not want to deny myself an opportunity to feel better.

So 2 months go by and I consistently go to my weekly session. Eventually my sessions were only doing the biofeedback, even though I wanted and needed talk therapy. 
They also arrived 15 minutes late to a session (without any notification) AND during my last few sessions, they  spent 10-15 minutes of my time complaining about their own problems.
My copay was $45 per session, so I did not appreciate that. (2months cost me $360)

Here’s the present problem:
I recently started school, and due to requirements, had to change my session time/day.
The last time I saw them (~3 weeks ago) I told them I would like to change days and they responded along the lines of “ I am sure I have another availability, I’ll get back to you on that”. 
A few days later, I text them to see if they looked at the schedule—- no response

The next week I got the confirmation text for the appointment on Tuesday, I immediately texted them to remind them I can’t make it and that I’d still like to find another session time that works. —— no response.

The same thing happened last week, automated call and my text response, asking for their available times—- NO RESPONSE

This week I got no text reminder, which seems like they removed me from their schedule.I text them 1 final time saying I wanted to keep seeing them and to please let me know what availability they have. —— no freaking response

I have still yet to hear from them. 
No discharge summary or reason.
Luckily, I have been on some medicine that has really helped me (thanks to an NP, not the therapist). But I have to be honest, this hurts. Guess you could say I was ghosted by my therapist. 

I really don’t like the idea of putting  someone’s job or livelihood in jeopardy. But I also don’t want anyone else to experience this, especially if they are emotionally or mentally vulnerable.

I also feel like I spent almost $400 for mental health services, that did nothing for me. Again, I am 24 and in school, so budgeting that money for therapy was difficult, but at the time I thought it was a necessary expense. Now I need to find a new provider, which can take months. 

Important notes: 
- I work in providing healthcare services (all I’m comfortable saying), so I am familiar with ethic guidelines and appropriate provider-to-client relationships.

For the first year of our relationship we were under the impression that his ex would be leaving the country, taking the girls, and I would probably never even meet them. She advised him on the day of their departure that she was just going for a holiday and would be back in three weeks to continue living in the house they own.

For the next few years his ex refused to allow me to meet the girls, saying she didn't want them around my boyfriend's ""whore"", etc. I eventually met them and for about a year we formed a friendship, although I have no interest in children and don't want any of my own. During this time my boyfriend stayed the night at his ex's house a couple of times, and I saw them maybe six times.

A year ago, my boyfriend and I bought a house large enough for the girls to stay over, I bought them beds and they stayed a few times. Six months ago, my boyfriend got a raise, and the gov advised him that he had moved up some bracket and would be paying a substantial amount more child support. Even his ex agreed it was a lot and they organised that he would have custody of the girls one night a week. He only told me that he would have the girls sometimes and didn't elaborate. I didn't question it as, of course, they are his children.

I checked our calendar and the girls staying over had been added every second Saturday. The girls, now 8 and 5, were exhausting and messed the place up...okay. Then my jewellery started going missing, and my make up was broken and messy. The girls started stomping footprints onto the newly painted walls, rollerblading on the carpet, and hanging around in my study, playing with my stuff and yelling while I was studying. My boyfriend knows I am uncomfortable telling someone else's kids what to do, especially given his ex's feelings on me seeing them, but my boyfriend didn't tell them to stop until I would ask him to.

On their last visit, the 5 year old snuck off to my bedroom to bother my 15 year old cat, even though she has been told not to. I'm ashamed to admit that I knew she was in there, but it was late and I thought the cat could just take one for the team. When I later went in there, the cat was showing the whites of her eyes and flinched when the 5 year old spoke. The next day I picked up the cat, who started screaming. The vet said she had a ""tail pull injury"" and asked if there were young children in the house. My boyfriend denies the 5 year old did it, as she wouldn't lie to him.

Finally the stress of the situation got to me and I broke down and told my boyfriend the girls couldn't stay any more, at least not right now and so often, and I was willing to break up with him if that wasn't negotiable, which is true. He has agreed in the short term while we work something out, but I feel like an asshole for not letting his kids stay in his own house. AITA?",False,False,4,3,2,3,2,3,Care
1,"AITA For Refusing to Allow My 16yo Daughter to Shave her head for Charity? | So daughter came home from school today and announced she wanted to ""Brave the Shave"". A fundraising scheme suggested by the British, Macmillan Cancer Charity. I'm sure the charity is well-meaning and think this is a fun and novel way of raising money and awareness, however, I think this is trashy and so disrespectful to cancer sufferers who are just fighting to stay alive.   I also hate the ""look at me, look at me, aren't I wonderful for caring"" narcissistic mentality that has crept into society. Shaving your head in no way helps you empathize how someone is suffering the emotional and physical trauma that cancer brings. To pretend otherwise is unhelpful and in poor taste. I did commend her good intentions and suggested a donation instead though but told her absolutely not.   She is unhappy and now sulking for my lack of support.

In early April, the fish started swimming weirdly and just not acting the same as he used to, so my friend was trying to find out what was wrong, changing the water quality, and when she told me how much money she spent on new supplies for him (like 200 bucks) I was pretty surprised. She lives with her boyfriend so they were both trying to fix him, but he ended up dying a week ago.

My friend told me that the day her fish passed, she and her boyfriend found a little box for him, and buried him in the yard. She said that they had both cried for a couple of hours, and she also posted a couple pictures of the fish (from when he was alive) onto her socials, making kind of a tribute post for him.

I'm sorry, but the whole thing was weird to me. Who buries a fish? I thought most people just flushed them down the toilet. It's not like this was a dog or cat or even a hamster. If that was the case, I could understand having some sort of connection with them, but a fish doesn't even know who you are. Not to mention that her bf was crying when the fish wasn't even his

I told my friend (in a concerned way) that it was strange she was this upset about her fish passing away, and asked if there was anything else going on in her life to make her react this strongly. She basically blew up at me, called my names, and told me to talk to her again when I want to apologize, but I don't think I should have to say sorry for expressing how I felt in a polite way, especially when she was so rude in turn

0,"AITA for leaving my pregnant gf after a fake ""miscarriage""? | Basically my parents, her parents, and nearly all my friends are calling me the asshole for breaking up with my pregnant girlfriend (it's my kid) so Just looking for perspective here. I'll keep things as objective as possible and happily accept my final judgement.

&#x200B;

3 months ago we found out that my gf (or ex now) is pregnant. It was a big surprise since we take precautions (condoms, BC) but she said it might've been a broken condom + she was bad about staying on BC routinely. Regardless, it was confirmed she's pregnant. I'm 21 and she's 20.

&#x200B;

I took the news badly at first. I became surly, didn't talk, and just kept to myself for 2 whole days right after she told me. I was terrified and did NOT want to be a father at all. I just needed time to adjust to the news. I think she expected happiness from both of us as she imagined I'd scoop her up and kiss her and cry tears of happiness after hearing she's pregnant (I know this bc she even referenced that scene in The Office where pam/jim find out they're having a baby).

&#x200B;

Our relationship during this time was extremely rocky because she wanted us to be engaged before the baby came, and I dragged my feet. I took her to all of her appointments, paid for as much as I could afford, and was there 24/7 for anything she needed. I guess it was more emotional connection that I just couldn't force through and she could tell.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago she sits me down and tells me she lost the baby. She says she had stomach cramps and then she miscarried. I was asking her a lot of health questions (I didn't know if a miscarriage this late into a pregnancy was normal?) and she kinda waves me off and is like don't worry I'm ok. After this our relationship's getting slightly better only because I'm slightly more relaxed now. She could tell and asks me to be honest about how I feel about the miscarriage. I tell her I'm sad it's happened so suddenly and mostly still worried for her but deep down I am really relieved because I 100% wasn't ready to be a father.

&#x200B;

WRONG answer. She starts screaming, crying, throwing things at me. She says she's not miscarried, that it was a test to see my dedication and I've failed it completely. In short we fought for like 3 whole days after this, with little sleep bc she'd randomly throw cups of icy water on me if I dozed off. At the end of that I said I can't do this anymore and broke up with her. I told her I'll be there for the baby and I'll pay my share of whatever is needed but I can't be her boyfriend and I can't marry her.

When I cleared my college entrances last summer, I could have gotten into a few good colleges (***not the best ones though***), most of which were expensive AF. I understand my parents aren't loaded and need to save money. Although they never directly told me, I knew they were struggling with this descision, as they couldn't afford these colleges. But they also never directly told me about their financial condition. They also told me that I did not get into any **top tier** colleges anyway, so it dosen't really matter. Finally, we talked it out and since I had plans for further studies, I agreed to choose an okay college for bachelor studies. Now 3 years in I can confirm this was a big mistake. The sheer lack of opportunities is very frustrating. I constantly see my friends posting about the fun stuff they do at their colleges and mine has none of that. I'm disappointed beyond the point of complaining. I just killed my future before it even started. 

And my parents know this. I know they are not to be completely blamed for it, but it just sucks that they didn't give me that. All I wanted was a normal college life, like everyone else. But because my parents couldn't afford it, I'm restricted, disppointed and constantly depressed. I've told them about this and they always blame me for not working hard enough to get into the **top colleges** where they actually would have considered shelling out the money. We've had mutiple arguments about this and I can only do so much to keep myself ahead of the crowd. I worry for my future too much.

Then a woman walks up, doesnt even get within 100 feet of the stage and  opens her arms as if to say ""here i am"". The kid runs up to her and off they go. Now a few things bothered me. One is how long it took her to get there, it wasnt a giant location. It took her an awfully long time to either notice he was gone, or to get to him. The other thing which enraged me a bit was that she didnt even have the fuckin appreciation to go up and say thank you to the strangers who sat with her son for 5 minutes and tried to make him feel better. 

So i walked up to her after she had walked away and said ""hey"" she looked at me and i said ""Nice job losing your kid at a festival, couldnt even say thanks to those gentlemen up there for takin care of him, smarten up moron"" and walked away.

0,"AITA for kicking out this mother from volunteering? | I volunteer often at a soup kitchen in my town (at least once a week) and I normally end up getting put “in charge”. Far too often, we get parents that are taking their kids there to “teach them a lesson in gratefulness” which I don’t agree with. Of course kids should be grateful, but I don’t think that people down on their luck are props for these people to use for a couple of hours. They can hear everything these people are saying, and it’s just degrading in my opinion. Teach your kids about being grateful and then you can also teach them that it’s good to give back, volunteer your time, etc. 

Then over the weekend, a mom brought her 12-year-old daughter in to volunteer. The mom had a smug look on her face and insisted her daughter serve food, so she “got a good look at the homeless”. Normally we don’t let kids scoop the food, but I did let her give out the rolls because it wasn’t worth the argument at the moment. The mother was scooping the food and to give her credit, she was being good with the people who were coming through the line. Her daughter looked like most of the kids that come, bored, unmoved. One outing at a soup kitchen isn’t going to turn your kid grateful for their iPad. But again, not my business, so we move on. 

The mom did keep making comments, however, to her daughter when we had a lull, such as “Do you see how good you have it?” and “Can you imagine how humiliating it’d have to be to come here?” it was annoying, but I just had to let it go because at least she wasn’t saying it in front of the people that were utilizing our services.

Then a bit later in the night, a girl that was probably in her later teens (but still a minor), came through the line. The mom started talking to her, and the girl shared that she had been kicked out of her home. As soon as she said this, the mother turns to her daughter and says, “You see, Rebecca, if you don’t stop with your smart mouth, this could be you some day!”

The teen looked humiliated. I was pissed. At this point, I finished serving the teenager, told her about services that could help her in the area and apologized. I then turned to the mother and said “You need to leave.” She said I couldn’t make her. I said she was being highly inappropriate and making the people feel uncomfortable. 

The mother tried to explain her daughter was ungrateful and I said “This isn’t the way, just get the hell out.” 

The daughter said “Let’s just go, Mom, this whole thing is stupid.”

The mom huffed, grabbed their stuff and they left. 

Now, I know this looks like a validation post…but it’s not. I was sharing this point of view and what happened with a fellow volunteer friend.

Usually in conversations, if I had issues with saying a word, he would say ""t-t-t-t-today junior"" and then laugh. (I think he got it from waterboy). It really pissed me off but I didn't say anything about it as we weren't in a formal work setting so I let slide. 

Anyway, he left and I didn't see him for a few months. I met up with him recently when I was in a cafe in town. We were talking and it was fine, but then my stutter started happening when we were talking about work. I can't remember exactly what we were talking about.

1,"AITA for not recording my sister's wedding? | Love this sub, long time lurker and I (F28) FINALLY have something to post where I'm looking to have internet strangers weigh in on my life.

Backstory: My sister/only sibling Diana (F26, fake name) got married to the love of her life back in October. Although they hired a professional photographer, they neglected to hire a videographer for the ceremony. While Diana is getting her hair done, she asks me to record the ceremony on my phone. I told her, ""I don't have enough space on my phone"" because I had no idea how long the ceremony would take place. She came up with the solution that I would sit up front and use her phone to record everything. I agreed to this.

As the wedding began, I sat at the front row (they didn't have a wedding party as to avoid hurt feelings, which was fine by me). It was there that I realized that Diana never gave me her phone. Shit. At this point, I figured what's done is done. The wedding was never recorded by me. I still have no idea if anyone else recorded the wedding, but I would assume not.

After the reception as we were driving home in separate cars, Diana texts me to ask for the wedding video. I am NOT going to ruin her wedding night by telling her there is no video, so I told her the file was too big to send. She went on her honeymoon the next morning and was a happy bride.

Present day: 8 months later (aka tonight), Diana calls me up asking for the video because she wants to do something with it for their 1 year anniversary. This is the first time she's brought it up since her wedding. I told her I never recorded it because she never gave me her phone. Then I reminded her of the conversation we had while she was getting her hair done. She was quiet for a moment then said that she had to go.

My side: Things were so hectic because of last minute wedding things that I literally forgot about recording it until it was too late to do anything about it. I don't think IATA for not recording it since Diana never gave me her phone, so there was no option for me to do so. Considering the wedding was back in October, I don't remember how much space I had, but I know it was less than 6 minutes of recording time. This ended up being right under half of the ceremony time. I genuinely feel bad about not getting the ceremony recorded.

Diana's side (I'm assuming; she hasn't called me an Asshole yet, but based off of past experience this can blow up pretty huge): I said I would record it, and I didn't. I should have gotten the phone from her to record it because I agreed to do so. If I didn't have her phone, I should have found another phone to record the ceremony.

I spoke to her about getting him a car in dec for his 18th bday in january since he got his full license and he's going to be going to university away and needs a way around in the town the uni is in. She agreed and I told her that I wanted to get him a new benz for like 65k, she was totally against it. I told her my reasoning which was I've been working my ass off since I was a kid in order to buy nice things for my family, he's a good kid who has never got into trouble and he's been getting straight A's all throughout highshcool and got into a very competitive engineering program, and it won't affect us financially at all. She was still against it for some reason, but I went ahead and bought him it and gave it to him today. He was super happy and very appreciative, and I was extremely happy that I could get my son a car like that. 

When my wife came home she saw the car in the driveway and she was super pissed, I've never seen her like that before and I legit thought she was gonna stab me. She was mad because I hid the purchase from her and that I disobeyed her, I told her that we won't be giving it back so she needs to just be an adult and deal with it.

Growing up I was poor, that 65k was over 3 times the amount my parents made combined when I was his age and my parents never got me anything.

0,"AITA for wanting to buy my niece a 3DS console? | This is a throwaway because I don't want anyone to know it's me.

A little backstory. My niece is 14 and absolutely loves the Pokemon games. She had a 3DS that she used all the time, but a it met it's unfortunate end in an accident a couple of weeks ago.

My brother's financial situation is a bit unstable at the moment. His long term GF of about 7 years (who I'll call my SIL for simplicity) lost her job and either can't or won't get a new one (Idk the reason, it's none of my business.) My brother makes enough to support his family, he can put food on the table and pay all of the essential bills, but some of the more luxury things like Netflix/Hulu and his internet had to be cut out. He recently found out that his car will need a bit of work so he does have a financial hurdle he is trying to work around at the moment.

So here begins the actual conflict. My nieces birthday is coming up and my brother was talking to me a few days ago about how he may have to push any potential gift back by a few weeks because he can't really afford it. I'm single with no kids in a 2 bedroom apartment, so I have much more leeway in my budget. I offered to replace my nieces 3DS as a birthday gift. He gave me a bit of pushback because he didn't want me to have to cover his ass and there was no way he could pay me back in a reasonable amount of time, but I told him it was fine, that I didn't mind it at all, and that he didn't owe me anything. He is totally ok with it, he just wanted me to take credit for it and not put his name on it. I told him that I want to at least put their name on the $20 Nintendo gift card I want to get so that she can have something to open that is from them. We both agreed to that, he thanked me and I told him I'll buy it soon.

I found this badass Galaxy looking 3DS that I think she will absolutely love. I bought it, along with the $20 gift card. No problem.

This morning I woke up to a text message from my SIL. She's upset with me because she feels that the money I spend on a new gaming console could have gone to something like bills or the car payment, something that would help their family in the long run. She doesn't think it was a good idea to purchase my niece a 3DS at all and is upset with me because of it. She's even asking me not to give it to my niece and to take it back.

I haven't responded yet because I don't know what to say or how I feel about it. On one hand, she is totally right. The 200 dollars I spent on that game system could have really helped my brother and his family out. On the other hand, I should be able to do what I please with my money and it would be awesome if my niece could open a gift on her actual birthday.

He lived there his whole life and when we got married (5 years ago) I moved there to be with him while we applied for his residency in the USA. Our ultimate goal was to move to the USA and find work, start a family, save money. 

About 3 years ago, his 80 year old father started to feel tired. It began with him not moving around as much and asking his family to bring him everything to his room. During this time, I also got pregnant and had a baby boy.  We raised our son in Brazil for about 2 years until my husband got his green card. Once he got it, we planned to move to the USA within six months. Well, his father’s health kept declining and for the past year we put off our move to take care of him. I mentioned my husbands siblings because I always felt they didn’t put in as much work as my husband did to take care of their father. My husband was basically his primary care taker. As you can imagine, this is very hard and constant work. His siblings would help out, but most of the responsibility landed on my husband. We found out a few months ago, his father has stage 4 cancer. 

Although this news was heartbreaking, we couldn’t put off our move any longer this year. We had to move to the USA or risk losing the green card and all the money we invested. We made arrangements and my husbands siblings took over the care-taking responsibilities for his father. 

We’ve been in the US for about a month now. Our move was very emotional for my husbands family because they grew accustomed to having us around. My husband is also feeling very guilty about leaving when his father is on his death bed.

He wants to go back for a couple months and I can’t help but feel exasperated. I love my husbands family and I can understand the absolute stress everyone is under, but I feel like our children and I are being pushed to the side lines. Also, this complicates his residency application.

It talked about how in the last few months of his wife’s (my Mom’s) illness he had disconnected emotionally and was just immersed in being a caregiver, etc and how it tore him up inside to see her like that. The email even referenced me, “daughter doesn’t know how hard this has all been on me, just thinks of me as Dad who doesn’t show emotions.”  The email even referenced his feelings of love for this new woman. He just stands there while I read it, and says that he hopes it helped me understand where he’s coming from.  

I did not yell or cry or anything, but I clearly wasn’t giving him the reaction or support he was hoping for.  I told him that this all made me really uncomfortable, and that I REALLY had a problem with him dating someone so young. He was kind of put off and said “well it isn’t up to you, literOcola.”

I've never really had anything go beyond a couple of months while she has been in 2 long-term relationships (4+ years each) - the 2nd of which resulted in a child who is now 5.

Given that I'd spent the whole of my teens and 20's effectively single, the little aspirations I did have of having kids basically dissipated away. In fact, I was initially unsure of pursuing a relationship with my GF because she had a son and knew that committing to her would ultimately mean committing to him too.

I have committed and while I have a great time with him and am happy to provide for him (his Dad is pretty useless but does see a lot of him as he lives 2 streets over), I don't feel that I have that 'unconditional' love that I even have for my nieces.

While my girlfriend has said that she has no interest in going through a pregnancy right now (her pregnancy was pretty horrible), she didn't want to say never. I said that I felt that my time to have a child has been and gone as I wouldn't want to even have her conceive until we're married which would be years down the line and I'd be in my 40's by the time my child started school.

She seemed fine with that but then I said, and this is where things changed, that 'I also worry that, subconsciously, I might give preferential treatment to my biological child over my stepchild'

She seemed extremely upset that I don't consider her child mine and that I was some kind of monster for suggesting that I could show preference to one child. It was at this point I brought up the fact that the father of her child already had a child and asked her if she loved them as much as she does her own to which the reply was ""that's different"" and left the room.


That was about 3 days ago and since then, barely a word has been exchanged between us, other than being told how selfish and uncaring I am.

I really don't think what I said was so bad and I didn't say for a fact that I would favour my child over a step child, merely that there was a chance that I could and I would hate to do that to my stepson so would rather not have a child at all.

Since I’m their only kid, my parents doted on me a lot and I was very close to both of them. The divorce was pretty amicable at first but it quickly turned very nasty and bitter and I was caught in the middle - essentially both my parents used me to hurt each other and I struggled a lot. I was a very happy and sociable before but the divorce really messed me up badly and was very traumatic for me - I was diagnosed with depression, picked up some destructive habits to cope, and spent some time in a mental health facility. I’m doing much better now but I still struggle.


I visited my dad for Memorial Day weekend (he always does a cookout) and was shocked when I saw my mom there - they rarely are in the same place. Long story short, my parents told me they never really stopped loving each other and were back together. I just left once they told me, I couldn’t believe it. My parents divorce destroyed my life and they acted very cavalier about it.

0,"AITA for insulting a girl's ""tan"" after she ridiculed me for having pale skin? | I'm born with pale skin and it won't tan at all. I need sun cream with SPF 50+ or else my skin will turn red. When I was a child, my skin tone didn't bother me at all, until people - friends, family and even strangers - started to point it out. For example, girls asked me why I was so pale. Or they even started to touch my legs and say ""wow, it almost glows in the sunlight!"". Sometimes strangers shouted rude insults whenever I crossed the streets wearing revealing clothing (Tshirt, shorts, dress and such). Hence I have been very self-concious about my paleness since I was twelve years old. I thought it was hideous and I refused to wear shorts or skirts even during hot and sunny days. Nowadays, whenever I get a negative comment about my skin color I say ""I simply can't tan"" or ""You wouldn't say that to someone with a darker skin tone, would you?"".

Yesterday, I was at a summer party with a couple of friends and there was this blonde girl who I have known since middle school. We were never friends, but we talked to each other every now and then. At first we had a nice chat, until she started to make comments about my pale skin. She was subtile in the beginning: ""You could burn easily with such sensitive skin"", but her comments gradually became more offensive, saying things like ""You look like you're ill... or dead"", ""You should get a tan. You will look so much healthier!"". By the way, she said 'skin cancer doesn't exist' and that she shouldn't use sun cream because she can't tan if she uses it. Which is the reason why she has tan lines and painfully red skin which she calls a 'tan'. 

After half an hour I finally said jokingly to her: ""By 'tan' do you mean flaming red skin like yours?"" which changed the tone of our conversation completely as I saw that she was genuinely hurt by my 'joke'. She whispered 'f\*ing dyke' as she walked away from me.

I was in bed and figured whoever it was had the wrong house (sometimes we get food deliveries for the number opposite ours) so would realize that and move on. 

The knocking kept on for another thirty seconds or so and I started worrying it was my mom who was staying with me and she’d gone out for a smoke and gotten locked out. 

An average looking guy was standing there knocking on my door but looking out at the street. I said basically “can I help you” and he said he’d been carjacked and his phone was in the car and he needed to come in and call someone to get him. 

I took a second to think about this and basically thought to myself “I’ve got my kid and my elderly mom in here. If this were to somehow go bad am I confident I could handle it by myself?” The answer was no. 

So I said through the door basically “listen it’s late and I don’t know you but I’ll tell you what I’ll call 911 for you and you can wait out there.” 

The guy said basically “I don’t know if they’re still around there man you have to let me in I saw his face what if he comes back?” and I said “sorry I can’t do that I can. I call 911 to help you or I can call 911 to have you leave my porch” 

So he said “you’re really not going to let me in?” And I said basically “it’s late and I can call 911 or you can go but no you can’t come in I don’t know you.” And he left. 

My mom was up and was coming over just after this exchange and said “who are you talking to the baby is asleep who’s here” and I explained the situation and she said basically “the guy was carjacked and you didn’t let him in?? That’s wrong. You help a person in need even if it’s inconvenient” and I was like you know I didn’t know him and I’ve got you and (the kid) in here and she said basically “you’ve got to give people the benefit of the doubt.

If I don't use it can transfer this education benefit to any or all of my spouse and children. When I joined I was leaning toward transferring it to my children as I don't do well in school (I might have some kind of undiagnosed learning disorder) and I'm afraid it might be wasted on me. However I could use it to learn a trade, or earn certificates or other qualifications that might be more attainable.

Life happened and my spouse and I are separated and headed for divorce. A large piece of this is that I am in an ongoing struggle with mental illness that has gotten in the way of me being any kind of functional. This issue is likely not related to my service so I would not be eligible for medical retirement / disability.

My spouse has asked that I transfer them the G.I. Bill benefit for their use. If I did have have no doubt it would be used well, as they already have a Bachelor's degree and over the years have done comprehensive career planning as to what additional schooling would have the highest return on investment. Due to my unemployment / underemployment we had been unable to make this financially possible. I believe this course would benefit them and by extension our children, as they have and I expect will maintain primary custody due to a number of factors.

My concern is that if I do give up my G.I. Bill I will be giving up a lot of hope for opportunity and security in my own life. With my mental health, my career in the service looks uncertain at best. I am a reservist and my mental health has previously blocked me from career opportunities such as converting my contract to an active duty one. I am not good enough at my job in the service to leverage it to a civilian job, and even if I were the longest I've been able to hold a job is about a year and a half.

Basically, if I do transfer my education funding to my ex they'll be set and my kids will probably be ok. I'll probably just get by and will definitely spend the rest of my life well below the poverty line. If I don't, there's a real possibility that I'll waste it anyway no matter how well-intentioned I am, and no one will benefit.

It will feel like 100+ degrees F when we are there this weekend.

Yesterday morning, I noticed that our Airbnb did not have air conditioning. I reached out to the host and asked them about window units, and ultimately they were only able to install one, in the living room. I was worried for Annie's health, and I didn't want to stay in that heat, either, so I called Airbnb to see what my recourse was. My intention wasn't necessarily to outright cancel, but to see if maybe they could move us, and what our options would be if they couldn't. After two hours on the phone with them, the only option they gave me was to cancel, and they managed to negotiate with the host to let us cancel with a partial (half) refund - originally, the host wanted to give us nothing. I was on the phone and forced to make a decision, so I accepted and canceled. We each lost about $50 with the cancellation. Had this all been happening over email, I would've texted them and gotten their okay before proceeding, but I had to make the choice over the phone.. so I did.

I hadn't told Annie about any of this because I didn't want to stress her out, but I did tell Mandy. She was of course frustrated that we had lost $50, she agreed that it was the right choice.

I told her we could book a hotel and Mandy and I would even split the cost if money was the concern, and she said no. She told me she would talk it over with Dan and get back to me on next steps. A few hours later, she texted me and said that I could book a hotel but she would only pay up to a certain amount, and we ""owed her"" for stressing her out.

0,"AITA for telling a friend to stay away from a guy because I think he's predatory? | Some backstory:

My close friend Ashley told me about some stuff that happened between her and this guy we both know from school Jared. Jared is 22, a senior and Ashley is barely 18 and a freshman.

We are all part of a team and Jared is a senior member as well as being in a leadership position.

During the 2nd week of school in the fall Jared started talking to Ashley and hanging out with her. She had expressed interest but said she wanted to take things slow. 

At a party we were at a week or so later he kept offering her drinks (she'd never drank before this) until she said yes. He ended up bringing her back to his place and although he tried, nothing more than making out and clothes on grinding really happened. He then told her that he wanted to be with someone his own age and ghosted her. 

We were all part of the same friend group and we had a small get together at a friend's house. To this, he brought another freshman that we kinda knew.
Over the next 6 months or so he'd consistently only gone after freshman in the group.


What happened:

A few weeks ago a friend of mine (a freshman) was interested in him and asked me if I knew anything. I told her about his previous behavior and that I thought he was, for lack of a better word, a predator. I felt like he was using his influence in the group as well as him being 4 years older than all of these girls in order to sleep with them was predatory.

I'm 21 and my girlfriend is 19. She says that I'm being an asshole and that it's none of my business who sleeps with who and if I had any legitimate concern I should take it up with the school.

1,"AITA for not wanting to cancel our vacation plans because my wife is pregnant? | My wife and I have been trying for a kid for a year and a half. It has been harder than we thought it would be (especially considering her 2 sisters  got pregnant very easily) and she has had 2 miscarriages that have been really heartbreaking for us. I can also tell they have put a lot of stress on her. 

We have a vacation planned to Costa Rica from December 12-December 23. My mom is Costa Rican and my aunt owns a big house there that is a 5 minute walk to the beach. We were planning on spending 5 days at a resort and then 5 days with my aunt. My mom and older brother will also be going to Costa Rica for a few days so it would be a big family early Christmas celebration with my Costa Rican family. My wife has never met my Costa Rican side of the family so we were looking very excited for this vacation and also thought it would be a good time to destress, take a break from our conceiving struggles and enjoy the warm weather (we live in Michigan) 

We just found out she was pregnant 2 days ago and of course we are ecstatic, but also a little cautious considering her 2 past miscarriages. However my wife has been freaking out and she wants to cancel our trip because she doesn't want to do anything that would but our baby at jeopardy. She says that she needs to be home and in a familiar environment and that she can't risk length plane travel and being in a ""3rd world country"" on her baby's health and safety/ 

I think this is absolutely ridiculous. I've done research there is no evidence that plane travel has a negative affect on a fetus's health and we even got a  few vaccines as a precaution for out trip, even though I didn't think we needed it (I have been to Costa Rica multiple times without getting any vaccines) We're going to be in a resort and with my family for the whole trip. There is no risk. My wife is not listening to any of my reasoning and is just insisting that she can't put herself through the stress of worrying about her pregnancy and would just rather stay at home.

I do admit I got a bit annoyed and said that if she doesn't go I'm not going to waste all the money and I would go without her She then got mad at me and said that she can't believe I would even consider leaving my pregnant wife alone. This is just completely ridiculous. I don't even have anyone to talk to about this because my wife refuses to discuss our pregnancy struggles with anyone in my family.

We're attempting to make new friends, but it can be slow going when you don't have any social networks. Last night my wife got home around 2 hours later than she normally does, but I figured she was probably out doing some chore. When she got home she started telling me about a friend she made. ""Good for her"", I initially thought, until I asked for more details. Apparently she started talking to another passenger in an Uber (let's call him Tony""). They were stuck in traffic and had an sizable chunk of time to get to know each other. The uber driver goes to drop Tony off at his place, at which point he invites my up to his place to ""continue the conversation"". To my horror, my wife accepted and spent the last hour and a half at his place.  


She can tell I was annoyed as she recounted this and asked what was wrong. I was upset that she went into a strange mans house who was most likely trying to hit on her. She said I was being ridiculous and that she was just making a new friend. I brought up that if he did try something no one would know where she was at.

Alan is autistic with probably OCD. He needs things to be a certain way. 

For example, at a recent dinner that I had planned for a surprise birthday dinner for another friend, Alan asked for a picture of the seating arrangement. I explained that there was no seating arrangement and anyone could sit wherever. He then, very politely, explained that he was going to be surrounded by other people that he did not know and needed to know exactly where people will be sitting. He also asked to be seated at a specific area, in between specific people, and wanted to know what the menu was. As a result, I had to figure out how the seats would be arranged in order for him to feel comfortable. I also forwarded him a link to the restaurant’s menu.

He is also very picky with what he eats. As a result, he started to nitpick every single thing on the menu. “What is this?” “Why are we eating here?” “I can’t eat here.” “I don’t like the food.” “You sure you can’t go elsewhere?” etc. I chose this specific restaurant because it was our mutual friend’s favorite.

He also asked me if I finished making sure how the seats would be positioned and asked if the two people he wanted to sit in between knew where they were going to sit among other things.

He is my friend and I understand him so I did what I could to accommodate him.

But, now my birthday is coming up and I know inviting him will be the same thing. It’s my birthday and I don’t want to feel like making my birthday be work when I just want things to go smoothly and how I want it to be without thinking of what to do.

Even though I have zero interest in that, I understand that people can have different interests and I don’t try to mold him into a more standard guy. 


Today it was just us two at home and he was making lunch for himself. He heated up some leftover rice, added some soy sauce, and cracked a raw egg directly into the rice. I asked him what the hell he was making. He said it was TKG, a popular Japanese comfort food. 


I told him that raw eggs shouldn’t be consumed and to heat that up in the microwave until the egg is cooked. He said he wanted to try something he just learned about and that raw eggs are safe and that the warm rice will cook the eggs a little. 


I told him that raw eggs definitely aren’t safe and he could get salmonella from them and that the rice definitely wouldn’t cook the eggs enough for it to significantly reduce the chances of contracting salmonella. I also said that he could get sick from it and hospitals are already overfilled. 


He told me to stop being so annoying. He proceeded to take his first bite. I grabbed his bowl and blasted it in the microwave for 40 seconds. He told me to stop fucking with his food. I told him to trust me on this. He was pissed at me. 


He told our parents at night. After hearing both sides, they said that I should have just let him eat it because they think organic eggs in America are very safe to consume raw.

It feels very strange when I drive it, is only getting worse. There’s been times where it has honestly felt like it’s going to straight up fall apart on the interstate and I have to drive extra slow.

1,"AITA for not liking my partners new hair choice? | My partner has decided on a new hair colour that she will go ahead with at the salon tomorrow. She showed me a picture around a month ago and asked if I liked it, I said no. She told me the following day she was booking an appointment to get the exact same colour as the picture. I told her I didn't like it and stated why. My reason was it was extreme and it reminded me of a rebellious teenage youth going through a phase and it would not suit her at all. Myself and my partner are almost 30 years old and have been together for 5 years. We have a son and we both work professional jobs and the hair colour is fairly extreme. She's going from a beautiful brunette to red and orange.

 I would never tell my partner what she could or could not do but I've told her numerous times I may not be happy with certain decisions she makes. Of the two of us I am the more level headed. I plan and think things through whereas she jumps head first into almost everything and she would agree.

My partner has stated before that she feels stuck in a rut at work. She doesn't like her job but I think it's mainly because a lot of her friends (ex colleagues) without children and at home responsibilities have moved into other roles across the country and she feels she has been left behind.  I asked her if that is why she is doing something so extreme to sort of stand out among the crowd and she said no. 

Fast forward to today and the conversation came up again after she reminded me of her appointment. I said to my partner I do not like the hair. Do not be upset with me when you have it and I do not like it. She accused me of being nasty and we argued a little. I told my partner I don't believe she will suit that hair colour and that I think she's quite selfish for telling me she doesn't care what I think about it she's doing it.

She had our son (I am a step parent but I consider him my own) when she was 19 years old so missed out on a lot of her youth and I believe she's trying to recapture some of it certain ways. We've argued before about me being boring because I don't like to go out to nightclubs and drink excessively like I did 8 - 10 years ago when I was a teenager. I have explained to her I'm over all of that and clubs are full of kids that I just don't want to be around. My mother was a serious alcoholic so I avoid alcohol now after going through depression and drinking heavily myself. This is getting kind of off topic so I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

Good news for him- the driver that hit him is quite wealthy, and my SO is looking forward to a large settlement since he won’t fully recover for a few years. We are pushing our wedding back by at least two years, and any plans for having kids by at least four or five. Here’s the problem, since he’s at home 24/7, he has found the hobby of online shopping.

It started out small- things for around the house, for me/him, etc. Today, I came home, and found that he had purchased a new desktop computer- a nice one, around $3500. Ever since the wreck, I’ve been supporting us- all of the bills, grocery money, anything- has been coming from me. The settlement isn’t supposed to start coming until June, so we won’t see anything until then. He’s racked up about $7800 in credit card debt, which I have to pay back monthly.

I warned her to back off at this point, but she insisted that she would ask him directly if he's single. She did so and he confirmed that this was his girlfriend.

So my wife has always had straightish but kind of messy hair. Lately she's been doing all sorts of stuff to it and ""embracing her curls"" as she says. I'm not exaggerating when I say she probably spends an hour working on it every time she showers and fixes it constantly throughout the day.


Anyways, she keeps getting alot of compliments on her curls and when people ask how she gets them to look so natural she says it's her natural hair. Well the other day we ran into my friends at the store, and I was introducing them. My friends wife mentioned how much she loved her hair and how she can never get hers to hold curls and asked for advice on how she gets hers to look so curly. My wife, like usual, said ""oh it's my natural hair!"" And my friends wife was telling her how jealous she was and how she wishes she could have curls like that.


Well it kind of annoyed me because well, that's not her natural hair, she spends a good hour every time she showers on it and constantly messes with it and puts a ton of product in it (to the point where I can taste it sometimes if it's in my face). So I said ""well I mean that's not really your natural hair but ok"". She kind of paused and gave me a look, and said ""I mean I do have naturally curly hair so..."" my friends looked kind of awkward for a minute and said well time to head out nice seeing you and left.


Well the second we got to the car she went off on me and yelled at me for embarrassing her. We got in a big fight about it and I told her I just think it's weird of her to always say her hair is naturally curly instead of just giving them advice on how she gets it like that and at the very least she could of told my friends wife that it's not like she was talking to some stranger.

But I messed up. My boyfriend usually deals with the bird. But he was away on a work trip so it fell to me. He texted me reminding me to clean the cage, which I really didn’t wanna do without him there. But he was insistent that it was gonna be smelly and gross by the time he got back so I said okay. I put the cat in the carrier and went to take care of the bird. 

The bird is usually pretty calm but today it freaked out and started flying. I wasn’t too worried because there was nowhere for it to go.

Before I could do anything the cat climbed up the back of the couch and managed to snatch the bird.

I’m grateful it didn’t suffer too long but of course I’m hysterical. I managed to dispose of the bird and clean up the mess (which I would rather not discuss because it was somewhat traumatizing).

I ended up calling my boyfriend to tell him the bird escaped out a window I didn’t know was open. 

Normally I would never lie about something like this. The problem is that my boyfriend already **hates** my cat and makes it clear he only deals with her because of me. (My cat won’t attack a person but won’t allow anyone but me to pick her up and handle her or she’ll scratch. If you try to just pet her she may deal with it or she may run away, depending on her mood). Anyway, it’s been a struggle.

I feel so bad but I know if I tell my boyfriend what happened he’s going to hate my cat even more and want to get rid of her. After a day and night passed, my boyfriend texted me and said he believed the bird was dead anyway. So it’s not like he’s holding out hope that it will come back.

My mom made a simple request for me to drive to the airport when they arrived, she told me \*around\* what time they would arrive. Right now, I realize I do not know what time they're coming, except in the evening. Which I assume 6-9 PM, great!  


To my dismay, she tells me that I will have to sit from 1 AM to 3 AM for her friends. Upon hearing this, I am immediately confused. My face and expression shifts to confused, sad, upset to angry. I paused for a good minute before saying: ""You expect me to wait for two hours just for a person I don't even know?"". My mom immediately takes offence to this saying: ""Excuse me? I can't even drive at night, and I am super tired at night. Can't you just have a little empathy for anybody? These people are new, they're a nice bunch."" For all of you to know, I can't drive at night. I was almost in an accident with a reckless driver a few months ago in the middle of the night. I'm still fairly new to driving, and just got my first car a month ago having used the family car for a long time.  


I feel that it's unsafe for me to be driving a vehicle which I am unfamiliar with, and having to stay up for most of the night to help some people I do not know at all. I just want to know if I was a little too big of an asshole for talking back at my mother for this reason.

1,"AITA for helping one female coworker carry something heavy but ignoring the other? | Hello! Disclaimer, this is a throwaway account.

I (25M) work as a server at a restaurant. I get along with the whole staff really well, and I have two female coworkers we'll call Emily and Jen. Emily is 22 and Jen is in her 30s.

The restaurant has 3 floors, so when you work on the second or third floor, part of the sidework entails carrying a big bin full of dirty dishes down the stairs and unloading it in the kitchen. It usually has to be taken down 5-6 times a shift, and we try to rotate who does this, but there is plenty of other work to do so it usually all works out.

Tonight I was on the third floor with Emily and Jen. Emily is pretty thin, and I've noticed sometimes she struggles to carry really heavy things. She doesn't complain or ask for help but her arms will shake sometimes and she is clearly having a hard time. Tonight she went to go take down the bus bin when it was really full, and I just took it from her and said something like ""I've got it, it's really heavy"" and took it down. I'm not trying to be a white knight or anything but it's just way quicker and easier if I do it and get it over with.

Later in the night, Jen and I were cleaning up and she randomly made a comment to me like ""You better make sure Emily actually does some work tonight, since you were doing everything for her earlier."" I was taken aback and said something like ""I just took down the bin for her since it was heavy. We're still getting everything done."" She then got really snide and was like ""well are you just helping cause it's heavy, or because she's cute? You never carry shit down for me."" I didn't even know how to respond to this.

Jen is a lot bigger than Emily and I've never seen her struggle to carry stuff. Obviously I'm not going to say this. I guess I could see how Jen got offended because it could come off like I'm playing favorites and helping certain coworkers over others?

AITA for somehow discriminating against Jen? Should I have just let Emily carry the thing??

Right now I am sleeping on our sectional and my husband sleeps in our room since he works M-F, and I get to stay home. He works hard for our family, I think it’s important he gets decent sleep during the week so I get up with the twins at night during the week. 

His mom is visiting from out of state next month and asked if she could stay with us a couple nights to “help out”. She wants to sleep on our couch with me (it fits two people sleeping comfortably). When our twins were first born she did this and I was miserable because she snores SO LOUD. Not only was I waking up every 1-2 hours to feed our twins, but I’d lay there wide awake when they’d finally go back to sleep because of her snoring. It was awful! I told my husband I don’t want her to stay with us because of the snoring and I suggested that she stays at her brother’s or sister’s house (both live in the same city as us), or a 2nd option, get a hotel. 

Well my husband is offended I said no, and he thinks I’m being extremely rude so he is refusing to tell his mom that she can’t stay with us. He told me, “she wants to help us out and we tell her to get a hotel? Absolutely not.”

I like to study there because its quite, however recently, I found a semi-hidden room. It had a bunch of couches, bookshelves, desks and a chair. Basically, it looked like a standard student lounge, so I elected to study there because its less creepy than the basement. There were a few signs saying ""Quiet please, this lounge is being transformed into an area for prayer, meditation and relaxation"", but seeing as how I was literally the only one there and I was just quietly studying, I thought I would be fine. After an hour, a guy came in with a prayer mat and started praying. I was as quiet as possible, and didn't acknowledge it but I feel like it made him uncomfortable as he kinda peeked in the room and walked out before hand. I thought it would be worse if I straight up bailed as soon as he started praying, so I kinda just chilled there and continued to review my flashcards. I wasn't in front of him or anything either. But I still feel like kind of a dick for encroaching in his prayer, especially since specific prayer rooms dont exist in our uni. This is also the second time this has happened to me, and one of my friends called me a slight asshole the first time for not leaving when someone came in to pray. (This was a diffrent senario though. The first time was when I was having a slight mental break down and ran off to one of the more hidden rooms in my uni building, and some guy started praying while I was low-key crying.

1,"AITA for ignoring my[27m] girlfriend[26f] for a week? | I’ve been dating this amazing girl for 6 months now. Due to recent events, I have not seen her for a month now since we leave an hour away. 

Just as some background, me and her both suffer from depression. When winter rolled around I told her there were times where I might just need a day or two to myself, where I don’t talk to anyone. She understood and says she may do the same. So far it’s happened twice, once when I needed a day and once when she needed a day. 

On Saturday, I woke up aggravated and agitated. I have a history of anger issues and when I texted my GF in the morning I told her how I was feeling. She told me to take the day and we can talk later that evening. I was happy with that since I was afraid of taking my anger out on her. 

Well the feeling didn’t go away. I texted her later that night and thanked her for the space and we said our good nights. 

After that my week got worse. From Saturday to today I was dealing with more bad news on top of more bad news. I’m not going to get into the specifics, but it’s wiped me out. 

I know my girlfriend has trust issues, so for the first few days we at least said good night to each other and that was it. On the fourth day, she sent me a message saying she was worried about me and it would help her if I checked in so she knew I was alright. I won’t lie, my message was short. I said that my week was horrible and I want to be left alone. I personally didn’t think it was her place to be worried about me. 

The next day she only texted me good night, but I couldn’t even bring myself to respond to her. The next day she didn’t even send me a good night. 

Today I finally reached out to her and let her know I was ready to talk. She told me that while she was happy that I’m ready to talk, that she does not want to listen to it if it’s about the week I had. She said that she had a terrible week, but she couldn’t just hide away like I did. I live alone and she lives with her family of 5 others. I know she deals with huge stresses from them and being as she can’t go to work, she’s been overwhelmed. 

She said that she had enough to deal with and that I had my chance to talk to her about this stuff while it was happening. She said she needs to be able to deal with her own sanity, and my silence gave her an anxiety attack but she knew she couldn’t reach out to me when it happened so she dealt with it on her own. 

I told her she knew what she was getting herself into. I had warned her about this kind of stuff. I’m a bit mad at her for blaming her anxiety attack on me and I told her that’s not my responsibility. She got angry and we haven’t talk since. I’m debating if I need to apologize or not.

Since nothing we could do would ever stop him, we told him he was allowed to smoke downstairs in the basement. Our thought process being, there he has no chance of getting in trouble or fucking his life up in anyway.

0,"AITA for banning extra desserts and foods from my family birthday party? | TLDR: I am making cupcakes for my birthday. My family wants me to make a cheesecake in addition since they don’t like cupcakes. I don’t want to make extra dessert, as I feel that every party we have has copious amounts of dessert and food and I’m sick of it.


A bit of background. My family loves to have parties for any occasion- birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, etc. While I don’t mind the socialization, the thing that bothers me the most is the outrageous amount of food at every event. I’m talking 4-5 desserts, candy, chips, three options for entrees, alcohol, cakes. It’s essentially a feast for 50 for the 15 or so people in my family. 

The issue with all of this is that many people in my family are over weight including myself. We all always complain about weight, not being able to lose any, yet every few weeks is another occasion to indulge. My boyfriend and other friends have commented on the crazy amount of food we have at parties and frankly, it’s a bit embarrassing.

This weekend is my birthday and all I wanted  were hamburgers and chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. I just wanted a chill day with a normal amount of food. Quickly this has spiraled- we now have fruit and veggie trays, a daiquiri bar, onion rings, chips, French fries, in addition to what I requested.

Here’s the conflict: apparently my family is not a fan of chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. So my aunt is requesting that I make a cheesecake as well. I pushed back saying no, we have enough desserts and if people don’t like cupcakes, they don’t have to eat them. 

My mom and aunts are so mad at me, essentially demanding I make the cake. They say I’m selfish for only making the dessert I like. I feel that since it’s my party, the dessert should be what I like. I’m trying to watch my weight as well and I just don’t want the party to turn into the usual pig out fest.

We lost our youngest son to SIDS. It was an awful and terrible time, it put me in a dark place. I got unexpectedly pregnant a year later and I struggled connecting with my daughter because of that, as well as taking care of our older son. Things are better now, I’ve gone to therapy and am on medication for my depression. It’s not a magic fix, but it’s been 10 years now and I can say for the most part, we’re all doing better.

My brother and his wife are pregnant with their first. They recently told me that they are having a boy and my brother told me he wants to name the baby after my late son. I found it weird for several reasons, one, being that they hadn’t had a chance to connect (we lived in different states at the time, now we’re closer) and he had only met him once and two, it’s not like an older relative or something. (My son was 4 months when he passed.) It’s my son. I also wasn’t sure that I could handle having another person with that name in the family. His name isn’t extremely common, but also not ultra-rare, so I do have to hear it in passing and it can hurt to see a child with it and think about how old he’d be, all his milestones, etc. And while that's a part of life and moving on, I don't think I could handle it on the basis we see my brother and his family.

I told my brother to please not to do that, out of respect for me, explaining why. My husband agreed.

After about a month I decided to ask her out and she rejected me saying she was dating someone.

As time went we've grown closer to the point of doing things which I feel only a couple would do like spending the whole day together, going over to each other's house alone, even going to a ball together. We even made plans to go only the two of us to a christmas market 3 hours away. I have also been really confused because aside from that one time she never gave any indication that she was with someone. She never mentioned anyone, didn't have pictures of anyone on social media, etc... which I think contributed to me letting this thing go on. Eventually this week, I overheard someone talking about her dating this mutual ""friend"" of ours and not much later I saw him groping her in the club where she told him to stop and seemed annoyed. I have never really vibed with this guy because he always does mean things like cut me off while I'm talking but nevertheless I can't avoid him as we have many mutual friends.

This has confused me because she has given no indication at all that she likes him or is involved with him. At events they often don't even sit together, and have never made public displays of affection. She has never told me anything like that, and she doesn't appear to be particularly good friends with him (for example this term we have done all group work together, and he only joined one group because I suggested it, hoping to get on better terms with him)). In lectures she always sits with me not him.

&#x200B;

On the last day before the break, we were both going home I asked her if she'd wanna do part of the train ride together. We met up and who else but he was there too which she didn't mention. I ended up having no opportunity to ask her in person. In the end after I said bye to her I ended up texting her to ask her whether it was true to which she responded that it was and that she ""doesn't like to talk about personal things"", that she wanted to mention it to me since we are friends but that she doesn't like to talk about it so much.

I feel really stupid, blindsided and humiliated. It's also made me realise that many things he has said where much meaner than I first thought, and I even wonder if she hasn't told him she rejected me. I feel also betrayed by her and feel like she has been leading me on all semester.

She leaves right after that and then my mother yells at me saying it’s my fault she trashed my room because I made her mad and talked to her friends. My mother then tells me I have done nothing but attack the relationship and their religion ever since they started dating (the pastor of my parents church set the relationship up) and tells me to move out. 

I moved into my boyfriends house and in the process of moving my mother called the cops on me while I was at work so she could get her car back. I have been making the payments on the car for almost a year and was planning to buy the car, even tho I understand the car was in her name. But now she has kicked me out, taken away my only way of transportation, and she changed all the locks at the house so I couldn’t get in and get my stuff. 
My dad helped me get most of my stuff because he is on my side but doesn’t want to upset my mother by going against what she is doing. 

My boyfriends family has been super understanding about everything and they don’t charge me rent (my mother did) and they let me use a car when I have to work or go to class.

0,"AITA for not giving into my older roommate's demands about my gf? | For context, I'm a 23 year old living in a subletted room of an apartment of a 43 year old professor. No contract, I just give her money each month. When i moved in, I told her that my girlfriend stays overnight twice a week. She said no problem to this. My girlfriend and I are both very quiet and friendly, and we mostly keep to ourselves by watching TV in my room. She's been spending more time during the day on Saturdays (like she'll be in my room Saturday afternoon - Sunday afternoon), but she's actually only stayed overnight once a week since I've lived here. We try to invite my roommate to go places whenever we go out, but she always says no. When I first met my roommate my girlfriend did nOT spend this much time at my old apartment, but since I've moved closer to her we now can spend more time together. So my life has just slightly changed since moving to this apartment, I promise I didn't intentionally omit how much she spends in the apartment. Total, she's probably IN MY ROOM with the door closed for 20 hours a week including sleeping.

My roommate also didn't tell me that there's a chore list of about 50 things that needs to get done every week. No problem, I'm happy to do it if it'll make her happy and make the apartment look nice. I've also driven dinner over to her office when she's been stressed about work. i've tried to be nice.

We're both super busy so my girlfriend comes over once during the weekday from 8:30 - 10:30, and then she comes over to my room on Saturday afternoon around 2, we'll go get some food for a few hours because it stresses my roommate that my girlfriend is in my room. Then we'll come back and watch TV for the rest of the night in my room. GF's then there until Sunday around 3 PM. For context, we're now in my room the ENTIRE time with the door closed and the TV on low, but we used to occasionally do homework in the living room or eat in the kitchen. At first, she didn't like us eating in the kitchen or being in the living room (common spaces) when she got home which I totally understood, so she asked us to eat in my room and not cook in the kitchen so no big deal, we now order out and eat in my room. Also, my girlfriend has never showered here, she showers before at her home so she doesn't have to use our water/shower while she's here.

Roommate has confessed that she often can't tell if we're in my room or not unless my gf's car is out on the street because we're quiet.  Fast forward, my roommate's work has gotten really stressful and she now tells me that it bothers her that my girlfriend is in my room on Saturday because she ""can't focus with more than one person in the apartment"" and she asked that my girlfriend leaves by 12 PM. She also asked that I tell her my schedule of when she is and isn't in the apartment. I now give her 24 hours notice and try to tell her our schedule. I'm a little annoyed at this point because I'm trying to be accommodating, but whatever.  We normally leave at like 2 PM now to go to the library on Sundays because i'm not gonna have a curfew imposed on me at 23, but i'm doing my best.

Now the kicker. What really hurt was that one of my students (I teach 2nd grade in a bad neighborhood) was shot and killed instantly on a Friday. I text my roommate that my gf and I will be in my room all day Saturday because I'm mourning and crying and grieving because you know, my kid was a victim of gun violence. She says she's sorry and blah blah blah, she's nice. THEN Sunday at around 2 PM, I manage to leave the apartment and an hour later (3 PM) while we're out, I get this text message. 

""if possible I’d prefer that you and gf not spend more time here together today. I’m not feeling well and it stresses me out when you guys are here on the weekends, especially since lately it seems to be the whole weekend and not just overnight. I understand you wanted more time yesterday but you did not ask for today and I’ve already asked before that you and Koryne not stay past noon on Sundays. This is my home and I need to have a space in which I feel comfortable."" 

When I saw that text, i just broke down crying. It definitely not the whole weekend? I was heartbroken that someone could be so unforgiving when she knew I was upset about my kid dying. 

it's not just her home, I also pay rent here. I don't know. AMTA? I'm tearing up while re-reading that text. I'm moving out at the end of December which I'm very thankful for, I'm just nervous for these next few weeks. My job is really hard sometimes ( re: my student died) and my girlfriend is my rock through it all. I can't do this without her. Also I keep saying in my room because whether or not my girlfriend is there, I'm in my room with the door closed. So it doesn't really affect the roommate in anyway. 

TL;DR Roomate was ok with gf staying over twice a week, she's actually not. She gave me a list of 50 things to clean every week and I do them. She didn't like us in common spaces so we don't hang out there anymore. She told me to give her my schedule so she know's when we'll be in the apartment and I've done that.

Fast forward no less than 5/6 months when I get a notification on my phone from that mutual friend asking if I was free that weekend to go out. I was taken aback since we hadn't talked in forever but I agreed.

We get there and after some small talk she ""confesses"" that she wanted to go get dinner with me because I'm a great listener and seem like a level headed person.This wasn't the first time I heard that, but I was still wondering what she had to tell basically a random stranger to whom she talked to once.

Then she goes off : apparently she hadn't contacted me in months because her bf did not allow her to make new friends, especially dudes. They were on a break now which is why she, and I quote, ""Had the nerve to go out alone with a boy"". I was shocked.She goes on to say he constantly hurt her physically, emotionally toyed with her, threatened her,broke things in her home, would not let her go out, etc. I explained how she was in a VERY dangerous relationship and that she did the right thing by leaving him.

Then she said in very sad tone ""Doesn't matter , I love him and we'll be back together soon"".Her situation was deplorable: she knew what kind of a relationship she had, however she was convinced by him that he was all she needed and ever will deserve. I tried talking her into going to the police , or her family. She bluntly refused and told me she just wanted to talk to someone, that being me, but not doing anything about it.

I didn't personally knew the guy, I had buddies who did.I asked her if she was ok with me talking to him about all of this to which she firmly said ""no"". She told me how he has HUGE anger management issues and that he'd beat me. First of all, it wouldn't have got to that, and second, even if it did and I had to defend myself I'd have no problems (The guy was an absolute joke). After a bit more of her telling me what an ass the guy was, telling me about his threats of hurting her if she didn't act as he wanted, we both went home. I tried contacting her to see how she was doing after about 1 week and I received a text telling me they're back together and that she HAS to block me. I contemplated talking to the guy but I figured all of that'd go back straight to her and so decided I had no way of doing anything, after all, we were all adults and I had no real connection to any of them.

So I've always been a runner, I do a few 5ks a week depending on free time (we both work full time). He usually plays sports to stay healthy, soccer and volleyball at community fields. Recently he decided he wants to run a half marathon and started running with me. Great! I figure why not do one myself, so we started running every day.

The thing is he has no sense of limits. So last night it was thunder storming and he asked me if I wanted to running with him in 30 minutes in the middle of the thunderstorm. I raised an eyebrow at him and said sure, but it was sarcastic!! How could he not know that I was being sarcastic. So 30 minutes later he's in his t shirt and shorts (it's also 40F outside) and running shoes and asks if I'm ready from the other room. I tell him I wasn't being serious about running, and has he looked at the weather outside. He frowns and says it's fine, he'll just go running by himself.

I suddenly get scared because I don't want him to get hurt or sick so I run to the door and block it. This starts an argument (which is relatively rare in the relationship) where he says it's fine and other people do it and that him and his friends play soccer in the rain all the time. But I point out that it's pouring now and thunderstorming and he just doesn't see the difference. Eventually I get frustrated and just let him go running but make him promise to be back within 15 minutes. He agrees.

It takes him over 20 minutes to get back. He said he didn't realize how much the rain would slow him down and he didn't bring his phone so he couldn't check the time.

He was crying because his parents told him to hide there and left him, and after a bit of waiting it became pretty obvious they weren't coming back.

I called the cops and they reported everything to the CPS equivalent of my country, which took him into custody and placed him in an orphanage. I went back to visit him almost daily, and after a few weeks the people at the orphanage asked if I wanted to foster and possibly adopt him, and I was surprised by my own lack of hesitance. After jumping through all the bureaucratic hoops the government laid out for single parents, I found myself with a son.

It's been a few years since then. My son is now 13 and I am 43. I never married but I never had any plans to. My parents used to pester me to find someone to spend my life with, but after I fostered and adopted my son they realized they wouldn't have any hopes of changing my mind.

Anyway, at a family gathering my nephew asked where babies came from, and not wanting to have The Talk with him without my brother I told him about how I found my son in the garbage. Later, my brother called me an asshole because now my nephew thinks babies are born from the trash. His wife also thinks it was insensitive to refer to my son that way.

2. Do I give him a fake number and risk running into him at the gym later and him being pissed?
3. Do I give him the correct number, and politely tell him that I’m not interested in being friends.

In two weeks my parents are visiting. My husband actively encouraged me to invite them (why dont you invite your parents to visit? did you ask them yet? why dont you ask?). I invited them and we even planned on them staying with us but they went ahead and booked a hotel, a rental car, and flights. Totally fine with us! 



We talked last night and he mentioned he wasnt very excited for them to be visiting. I know theres some tension between them because weve had issues previously but I asked why, hed probably barely see them anyway, as theyre here to see the baby and we have plans. He already expressed hed be working and 3 months ago we visited them and he spent the week getting drunk with his cousin and I spent the week with my family, which was fine, I had a good time. 



He told me theyd be here around dinner time as Id be home to cook dinner for him and clean the house. I told him he was grown and could cook for himself for a week if I wasnt around (if Im home I dont mind but Im not dropping everything to come home and make dinner). I also said if I wasnt here the house wont be dirty because - get this - neither of us would be here to make the mess. He was displeased with my answer and asked whether or not I planned on spending any time with him that week? I told him he was welcome to come with us if he was free, I dont mind planning something for the day he has off, and we already planned on going to his favorite restaurant and working around his schedule so he could come. 



I figure, my parents are spending a lot of money to come visit at our request. Theyve only met their first grandbaby two times, and my dad has met her once. I plan on spending as much time with them as I can because I want them to have a relationship with my daughter and frankly, I miss them. My husband thinks I should still make time for him.

My boyfriend and I both play video games with a passion, and that's great. But lately it's become a habit of him to pester me about my way of playing certain games that he also plays and it's really starting to affect me.
E.g. the latest case was him insisting that I take a certain card out of my deck in Magic the Gathering Arena, because it's apparently ""cringy"" to use it and there are better cards.
I've told him, on several occasions, that I like the card and my way of playing is fun for me and I want to keep it as it is.
For the record I haven't been complaining about not being able to win any games or asked him for any help considering the cards I use.
He just won't accept it. It gets to the point that I'm honestly starting to feel bad about myself and question if what I'm doing is okay... I just want to have fun the way I want, you know? It's not like I'm affecting anyone's experience of playing in this case. I play solo against other solo players; there aren't any teammates involved that I'm dragging down with this.

I've already got trauma considering my self worth due to really bad past experiences (that had nothing to do with him, but he knows about them) and therefore I question nearly everyhing I do, so this is actually pretty problematic for me. I don't even want to continue playing at this point because it makes me feel depressed.

When I last told him to please leave me alone because it makes me uncomfortable and that I'm grateful he's trying to help, but his definition of ""help"" is kinda counterproductive in these cases, he went so far as to block me on social media.

We both had babies this year. Mine is 7 months old and hers in 9 weeks old. She isn’t with the father so she had another one of our close friend’s—who was to be in attendance—have her mother watch the baby. She expected to watch the baby overnight and that we’d all sleep at someone’s house at the end of the night as you’re no good to an infant if you’re drunk. 

I don’t live in the same city as birthday girl so I made my way over, baby in tow, to the city where most of my friends live and where the birthday was being celebrated. My sister also lives in the city so she’d be babysitting for me that night. I could have left baby with dad but I didn’t feel comfortable leaving the baby alone with him from Friday-Monday. I’m 5 hours away so it’s not close enough that I thought it appropriate. 

I get to the city the party’s being held and and drop my baby off at my sisters and head out. 

We get to *decorated house* and start getting ready. Everyone is pre-drinking, doing make up and getting ready. I was soooo looking forward to going out with my friends but it just wasn’t in the books for me. I got ready, did my hair, make up, put on a dress and was ready to head out the door. Collectively, we took so long to get ready that dinner was cancelled and everyone decided to go straight to the club. I broke it to all my friends individually that I wouldn’t be coming.

I told her I was disappointed in Birthday Girl and that she shouldn’t be going out on paper tying benders with a small infant. She agreed.

1,"AITA for bringing my daughter home? | 
My husband and I (both 40m) are raising a 13-y/o girl, to clarify. 

My daughter struggles every few months with her period. She’s fine most of the time, but some months she gets her period unexpected at school, and it’s embarrassing to her. She won’t carry pads because they have clear backpacks, and she doesn’t like wearing her own slightly bloody underwear for half a day— understandable. 

When she gets her period, she goes to the nurse with “an awful stomachache” and I am called (I work from home so it’s easier for me to get her.) Nurse always reminds me that she “could be faking” but I always pick her up and bring her home. 

Yesterday, she called again, so I walked into school to get her and the nurse was waiting in the office. Nurse asked me if I was aware that my daughter had “a pattern.” I told her yes, but that we had things figured out. 
Nurse said that if she’s really having stomach problems like this, I should take her to the doctor, because she might have anxiety. I said “thank you, but my husband and I have things figured out.”

Nurse got very cold. “I don’t think you’re taking her anxiety seriously. Fathers are supposed to want what’s best for their girls, and as a nurse I feel it’s my duty to ensure she is safe.”

This lit a fuse with me. Here’s where I could be TA: I told the nurse “I know my daughter better than you do. It is none of your business what her ‘stomach issues’ come from unless a parent tells you.” 

She then told me: “I am afraid if she is not anxious she is manipulating you into bringing her home from school. Is there a class she dreads? Does she do her homework?”

I said: “My daughter is an honor roll student and an honest girl. I’m sorry you don’t think so, but I know her and I know she’s not lying to me. Stay out of our personal business.”
She turned over my daughter without saying much else. 

Daughter will now go to the bathroom and text me instead of the nurse— we’ll just say she has “an appointment.” I feel awful, though, for being ticked— the nurse is a professional who deals with awful parents daily, and I know she was just trying to help.

About two weeks ago she got admitted to hospital with a high fever. I knew some friends were going to visit her so I didn't go, not knowing where we stood and not wanting to ask. 

The other day, however, she messaged me, just asking how I was. I asked why the late message (since it was 2am) and she started to talk about how lonely she'd been at the hospital. And how ""i guess no one cares about me as much as i thought"". Obviously I felt bad for her, but it ws exactly this kind of talk that made my depression so bad I had to leave the relationship. 

I told her in no uncertain terms that ""I don't want to listen to this anxiety ridden self consciousness over and over again"" and that ""I'm not your therapist"". She responded that she only wanted to talk, but that she gets it. 

Am I the asshole? I feel like it

If there’s anything that I can do for you, please don’t hesitate to let me know. We may not be as close now as we were when you were younger, but I will always be here for you if you want or need me.”

She did not reply. I got an email from my ex the next day that said, “You have no reason to be contacting my child. You are no longer a part of her life and your efforts to change this are unappreciated. She is grieving the loss of her mother and does not need additional drama from daddy’s ex-squeeze.

He just got back to work as he spent the entire year that I was pregnant unemployed just because. He is qualified and can easily get a job but he chose not to. He was able to do this because a few years ago I was in a bad car wreck and received a decent amount of settlement money for my injuries. The whole time up until now, we have been paying the rent with my savings. Even now that he works he hasn’t contributed to rent, the only thing he pays for is when we go out to eat. 

For the past week, I have had extreme migraines & dizziness so I scheduled a doctors appt. I spent the night at my grandma’s because the appt was much closer & I figured it would be easier to wake up here since I had been feeling bad & would have to drive less in the morning. 

Coincidentally, his mom & my grandma live in the same complex. After he got off of work, his plan was to go to his moms to sleep. We also agreed the night before that he would watch the baby while I went to my appt. 

He gets out of work at 6 AM. I woke up at 10 AM, appt was at 11:30 AM. It took me a while to get out of bed because of the migraines & dizziness, & I also got up several times in the night to feed/change the baby. I figured by that time he was already asleep but I would call him to wake him up to let him know I was going to be leaving for my appt soon. 

Remember that his mom & my grandma live in  the same complex, meaning it would have taken him less than 2 minutes to stop by & pick up the baby. I asked if he could do this because I was very dizzy, I still had to eat, get myself ready, & get the baby ready. I would’ve been able to save a little bit of time & effort if he would have just stopped by to pick up the baby. If I had to drop the baby off, I would’ve spent more time also because his mom talks my ear off even if I say I’m in a rush.

He said he was not going to come pick her up because he was “trying to sleep” that he would send his mother instead. His mother has spinal issues and cannot walk down the stairs, especially not with a heavy car seat and diaper bag. Aside from that, I would’ve had to remove the car base from my car & install it in hers, which was going to take me even more time & was going to be hard for me to do with my symptoms. 

I get he works over night, & he was “trying to sleep” but he had been home for the past 4 hrs but when I asked for a favor that I never ask for, he’s trying to sleep. We ended up getting into a bad argument & said some ugly things to each other. 

Am I the asshole for telling him off? I have built up over time which I have previously communicated to him but he brushes all of it off.

Once I left, I met them all outside the classroom and we started to talk about the test, comparing what answers we all got, and how well we think we did.

This is where I think I may have been the asshole. She was the only one who was actively trying to not get us to talk about the test, and if the group consensus is that talking about the test is ok, then I'm still going to talk about it. So, I quietly kept talking about it away from her.

She seemed to angry at me and sighed loudly, eventually splitting off from the group when we went outside.

In hindsight, this decision was probably meant to smoothly integrate him as family and make sure that he felt like he belonged.

It was only until I interviewed my aunt that I found out. I feel like Mark deserves to know the truth of his past and he is mature enough to understand his mom's decision.

My mom was 17 when she got pregnant with me. 

Anyways, to the story: 

I got my period pretty late. I was 15 to be exact. And they were awful from day 1. At one point I literally couldn't move so my mom brought me to the doctor and I was told I have endometriosis (at the wonderful age of 15!) and that it would be extremely hard and nearly impossible for me to have kids biologically. Kind of sucked but I accepted it. But now that im 17 and kind of basically raised my sister, I realize that I dont want kids. Its exhausting and a lot of work and she isnt even my child. (my mom is kind of irresponsible and would leave me to look after my sister and go out with friends and come home late. I have to miss classes to take my sister to school, etc. When my sister and I go out in public together, people think Im a teen mom. I hold nothing against my sister. I love her dearly.)

0,"AITA for not stopping wandering toddlers from leaving the play area at the mall? | I know this already sounds bad but hear me out.

At our local mall, we have a play place I like to take my 2 year old son to so he can let his energy out. The play area is an open area with large soft decorations the kids can climb on. It's enclosed in a square but there is no door or gate to prevent kids from leaving (and I suspect so parents don't just drop their kids in and walk away). There are benches within the play area where the majority of the parents sit. Most people will watch their kids play but a lot are usually distracted by their phone. 

My son is a runner and will tear out of the play area in a flash so I always stand at the entrance/exit because I have to watch him like a hawk and will redirect him if he's trying to escape. 

More than a few times I've stopped children to leave because people aren't paying attention but today this one parent in particular would *not* pay attention. I stopped his (around 18 month) child twice but he didn't acknowledge me or say something like ""Whoops! Thanks, I was distracted for a second!"" This guy wouldn't get off of his phone (texting or internet browsing, I'm not sure) so his kid kept wandering away. After the third time he didn't notice her leaving- I didn't stop her but waved to get his attention so he would. Again, he said nothing. The FOURTH time this happened, I did nothing (I'm not a monster wanting a kid to get abducted, I was still watching her out of the corner of my eye but I was waiting to see how long it would take him to notice).

So, AITA? I personally feel like I’m not wrong to be disgusted by that behaviour, because I’ve done a lot of drinking, and drugs, etc, and I’ve never even *considered* driving while even *slightly* drunk or high. 


I don’t think “I was young I’m a different person now” or “I was drunk and didn’t make good decisions” are good excuses, because I’ve been a young alcoholic party animal too and I NEVER would’ve considered driving drunk, even  when I was too fucked up to remember my own name I could still remember “don’t drive, someone could die”. 


I have to be brutally honest and say that, deep down, I’m worried that anyone who would choose to drive while hammered just secretly doesn’t give a shit about other people and the fact that they might die. Anyone who would cheerfully bring up, and make excuses for, driving drunk in the past is probably still asshole too, since they obviously don’t feel ashamed of doing it, right? 


On the other hand, my friends who are still talking to me think I’m a completely judgmental asshole.

Her son can be a bit of a bully, is very aggressive and overall, just has some issues that she’s trying to help him with. So, we mostly just hung out ourselves until she moved, taking her son with her. Now, her son’s father (her ex) still lives in the states and her son comes to visit him as unaccompanied minor once a year. She’s always trying to say that the boys should get together but due to a few awkward playdates as kids, my son is just not interested and always asks that I make an excuse. This year was no different and I told her that my son was busy with camp during the time that her son was visiting. (A lie, he was hanging out with various friends and had camp, but I could’ve made time, he just didn’t want to and I wasn’t going to force it.)

Now, keep in mind, I don’t have any contact with her ex. Like at all. We haven’t spoken since the two of them divorced which was over 6 years ago. Not for any bad reasons, but we were never friends and the only reason we ever spoke was because of my friend. He didn’t contact me at all before this.

She has gone from 40kg to 51kg, she has obviously carried it on her stomach.

I absolutely adore my wife, she just gave birth to our baby so obviously weight gain is natural, healthy and she looks stunning no matter what 

She has decided to lose the weight, whatever makes her happy.

She has been going to the gym, 90minutes in the morning and 40 of a night, her mother watches the baby since she's only 20 mins away from the gym 

She decided to wear a sports bra to the gym,my wife doesn't look fat at all but it just didn't flatter her at all.

She asks and obviously I tell her that while I love her it just wasnt flattering on her.


She now won't talk to me.

0,"AITA for not wanting to let my mom stay the night? | Brief backstory here, I’m 23 and live with my boyfriend. We live in a small one bedroom apartment.

My mom relocated to live near me after I moved 1500 miles away from my problematic family at 18. I thought it could be a clean start and she might have changed in that time, but it is evident her narcissism, possible addiction, and mental illness still persist. 
Because of all of that, she has terrible credit and cannot rent an apartment of her own so she rents rooms from other people. Since moving here in August, she’s had 3 different living situations. We are always forced to take work off and help her move since she has no family here. 

In the beginning of March I let her stay on our couch for 4 days waiting for her finances to get in order to move into a new place. Then, within 10 days of moving in, she says that the guy she roommates with had to “refinish the bathtub” so she would have to stay the night with us.

I was skeptical because I didn’t understand why refinishing the tub would render an entire bathroom unusable for a 24 hour period. I asked her about this and she then said “well we have some kind of bug, I don’t know what it is, I wake up with bites so maybe he is bug bombing the house” 

This made me very concerned as we obviously don’t want to have bed bugs or fleas or any kind of bug in our house. It seems like she purposely tried to make it seem like the bathroom was the issue to not make the bug thing apparent before I agreed to let her stay.
I told her we didn’t feel comfortable with her staying here and would consider getting her a hotel room. She was upset that I would “think she has bugs” and I said she could stay as long as she only brought the bare essentials in a plastic sealed bag. (We are poor so could not afford to put her in a hotel anyway.)

Today, we were getting ready for work and offered to give her a ride back home. She was still asleep on the couch at 1:30pm. She said she would just find someplace else to go for the day and left abruptly, clearly miffed by me saying that it was time to go.

I really want to have a talk with her and explain that our couch is not a place for her to stay. We are adults with our own lives and I don’t feel responsible for taking care of her. In March alone she has been on our couch for five days total. 

I moved away from my family to NOT deal with this pervasive instability and now it has followed me.

 I feel that it is my right to not do that to my future children, but she also has done alot for me in my life, working 12 hours a day and immigrating her from China so me and my kids could have better prospects than she could.

He said that she’s not his girlfriend, but a model. I asked him why he had that as his wallpaper. He said she’s nice to look at. I told him that people are going to cringe when they see him with that wallpaper, even more than when they used to see his anime wallpapers. He said no one cares what his wallpaper is. 


I told him if he wants to motivate himself to get a girl like Anna, then this isn’t the way to go about it. I told him to actually go out and talk to real girls and perhaps he can meet one that is a match. He said he isn’t looking for a girlfriend at the moment. I told him it’s about time he starts talking to girls before it’s too late to start. He told me to stop giving him shit for his wallpaper and for not caring about getting a girlfriend. I said that I’m just trying to help him and it might be embarrassing to hear this from his little brother, but he has to hear it from someone who wants him to succeed in his social life.

After watching it she ran upstairs to her room and cried for a straight two hours. It’s been two days and she hasn’t left her room and eats all her food inside her room too. It’s getting kind of irritating because whenever she comes downstairs she won’t stop talking about the character who died.

My sister had an abortion two years ago, I don’t know if that’s related to the character at all but she had a son I think. That’s the excuse she’s giving but seriously, she’s mourning like the character is real.

Finally today after she wouldn’t come downstairs for breakfast and sat in her room with the curtains closed, I stomped upstairs and told her to get the fuck over it, she’s not a real character and it’s just a TV show. She started crying and told me to get out.

After wrapping gifts, I did dishes and put dinner in the oven, and asked him to turn it off to spend time with me with/without kids. He said no.

background: i (21f) am the first child, currently finished up my first semester of my last year in college, and live about 5 hours away from the rest of the family. i have a younger brother (15m) who still lives with my mother (40sf).

context: my freshman year of college i *willingly* turned on my location services for my mother to track my location because i was nervous about living so far away, with no car, and no friends. for the first two years, it was just there as a safety thing. the past year and a half, my mother has taken to checking in on me more often; asking me why i’m out so late/who i’m with/why i’m where i am. 
for example: i met my current boyfriend about 6 months ago and started spending the night at his place. my mom called me around 3am one morning ranting about why i wasn’t at my university. 
anyway - i am getting close to graduating and moving in with said boyfriend, i now have a car, am working on a job, and trying to transition into “adult life”, and feel as if i might transition a bit easier if i didn’t feel like i was being monitored all the time.

0,"AITA if I cut off an old friend over a cat? | I posted yesterday about a big blowout I had with this friend over declawing her cat. I was mad about her doing that and she was mad about me judging her in front of other friends. Big fight. She ended the friendship. The post here got deleted since the powers that be decided it was a debate post about declawing. 

You'd think that makes this moot, but my other friends who have been talking to her suggest that in time she'll cool off and want to be friends again, and that I shouldn't make rash decisions like ""well fuck you then if you're going to overreact so much to criticism.""

Here's the thing.

When this friend, Thyme, was angry, she texted our other friend Avocado saying she couldn't talk to me as I am a brick wall and a bully, and she doesn't want to go down the rabbit hole again, so could Avocado let me know how she feels?

...We're almost 30. 

So Avocado let me know, per Thyme's request. I texted Thyme to say that if she's really done being friends we should arrange a custody agreement of our other friends so they don't get caught in the middle.

She got pissed and sent us all: ""Custody agreement decided. I'm 100% out."" As in, not being friends with any of us (me, Avocado, and our other friend Books). 

Avocado was stunned because she'd been letting Thyme vent to her and she just cut her off because she lives with me and I have bitch cooties or something. 

Hurt, Avocado tells me, ""Well, if we're going scorched earth, you should know that she had Whiskers put down.""

Whiskers was a 2/yo cat that Thyme adopted. He was healthy but incontinent. Thyme decided she would euthanize. I'd objected - told her it was shitty of her to put him down when he was otherwise healthy, and that she could rehome him. (She has a barn but Whiskers couldn't be an outside cat because she declawed him, just as she has done to the other >10 cats she has.)

Thyme got sick of it and told me she rehomed Whiskers at an apartment complex. Except she didn't. She confided to Avocado last week that she put him down because she ""had no way of knowing if someone else would do something to him"" (hmm, like kill him?)

If it was just that she lied, I would let this all blow over provided she stfu about declawing her pets. But I don't feel I can overlook this. Thyme has a history of doing things with pets I don't approve of - she once flushed her pet rat down a toilet because it looked sickly. The rat *swam back up.* Turned out it was mostly just dirty.

But to kill a cat because you don't feel like rehoming it, knowing that it could be alive if you hadn't declawed it, and then go on to declaw more cats? I don't think I can overlook that. It's just cruel.

Thyme, Avocado, Books and I have been a very close quartet of friends for about 12 years now. If Thyme decides I'm forgivable (fucking spare me), and I refuse to be her friend anymore over this, it could cause turbulence with the others and make them feel they have to take sides.

I went to a small high school and in mid-ninth grade, I became one of the popular girls. I was shocked but delighted, until I realized they only let me in the group to be the laughingstock they needed at any given moment. I hated it, but my love for being popular was stronger.

As expected we bullied a lot of other girls, but one in particular we bullied very harshly at least once a week. Let's call her Sarah. I'll admit that I bullied her a little more harshly and frequently than any of the other girls, because I was desperate to have my own laughingstock, all to my self. I also knew that Sarah was more confident, had a better relationship with her friends, and was kinder than I was, which just gave me more incentive to hate her.

Sarah eventually had enough of all that bullying she got and was homeschooled for 12th grade. After I graduated, I spent the summer distancing myself from everyone from that high school. I'm now in my second year of college with different people, and I have a couple of friends, similar to my state in elementary and middle school.

1,"AITA for damaging an ambulance to get to the hospital? | So today my mother went into labour. She urinated herself, and I knew for a fact that meant labour had begun.

I took my mother to her car but noticed an ambulance parked across our driveway. A small space remained between the rear of the ambulance and the wall, but wasn’t wide enough to drive through. Our neighbours are elderly and I assume the paramedics were in their house.

I sounded the horn for a few seconds before I jumped the short wall into my elderly neighbours garden and began hammering on the door. Understandably, they inside were busy, and I got no answer. 

After about five minutes I jump back into the car and attempt to drive through the small space between the ambulances rear and the wall. I can’t, as my bumper is touching the ambulances.

Not wanting to have to deliver my mother’s baby, I reversed and accelerated through the space. I ripped off part of the ambulances bumper and my mothers bumper. 

Eventually we got to the hospital and my mother is still in labour, but her car is damaged and I’m sure the paramedics will know I was the culprit.

1,"AITA For Spending Child Support Meant For One Child On All My Kids? | So I (32) F have four kids. I have two with my first ex husband who is currently addicted to drugs and has no contact with our kids, another child with my 2nd ex husband, and a infant with my now ex boyfriend. Yes, my love life is shit and I don’t plan to date until my kids are way older. I’ll just stick to my toys and romance novels.

Any who, I only receive child support for my child with my 2nd ex husband. He has an extremely well paying job and I receive 2000 a month. He is the only parter I split custody with. He has set up a trust fund for our son that he will have access to when he’s 18. 


With the 2000 I receive, I invest half of that into my eldest child’s tuition. He attends a very prestigious private high school and even with the full ride scholarship he was given, boarding and books weren’t included so I have to pay for his boarding every month. It’s around 2.5K a month and I cover the other 1.5 out of my own expenses. 


The other thousand I receive goes towards all my kids. Their food, clothes, and miscellaneous things. To clarify, I pay my own rent and bills. For example, my other child with my first ex husband was invited on a trip with her friends family to Disney Land during Winter Break so I spent a good chunk of the money on her plane  ticket, the Disney ticket, food and other things. Or maybe my son with my 2nd ex husband wants a new expensive toy he saw on YouTube so I go and buy it for him. And with a new baby, having that extra chunk of money to spend on everything he needs is very beneficial.


I never really discuss finances with other people. Last night I went out with an old friend and the drinks started flowing. She was asking how I handle all my financial obligations raising four kids so young and I did mention that the child support I receive from my 2nd ex husband not only helps keep things afloat, but the extra money every month that I don’t use is in a savings account for a rainy day.


My friend flipped out. She said it’s wrong I use money the court ordered to be used on my son on all my other kids. Since their fathers aren’t in their lives it’s my responsibility to pick up the slack and not my 2nd ex husbands. I tried explaining that my son will never have to worry about finances his entire life but my other kids will. She told me I’m money hungry and if my ex husband was smart he’d challenge the court to lessen the payment if they knew I was spending most of it on my other kids. I’m not gonna struggle when I have the money to give all my kids a better life. But being called a bad mother rocked my world and I need to know if I’m wrong for what I’m doing.

The best man wrote me and asked for a list of the groomsmen so he’d make sure he invited everyone. 

My younger brother is one of the groomsmen and is a recovering alcoholic in his third month of sobriety, just back to college after having to sit out a semester from the disease, and working very hard to stay on track. 

He and my fiancé are close and he’s been looking super forward to his first bachelor party, but decided he shouldn’t attend if it would be centered around drinking because he didn’t feel he was ready to handle being the only sober one in a group of drunk people. 

I found out when talking about guest list and plans that the best man was basically planning a night of poker and drinking games, so I asked him if he could do that some other night with just my fiancé and their friends and make the bachelor party a dry thing. 

He was pissed and said he shouldn’t have to plan two separate events just to accommodate one person and that it wouldn’t be a legit bachelor party without booze. I told him if he wasn’t up to the task, someone else could plan it, because there had to be a dry party. 

Now that I’ve had some time to sit with it I’m worrying it wasn’t my place to insist on this. I know my little brother would’ve been really hurt to not go to the bachelor party, but this isn’t his wedding, it’s my fiancé’s, but I do want him to have a good time and not be excluded because of his sobriety.

My niece who lives a 15 hour drive away is turning one. My sister has brought my niece to my home state 3 or 4 times since she was born, but my wife and I have yet to make it to their house. When my sister was planning her birthday I talked about it with my wife (who had recently found out shes pregnant) about the situation and we agreed I would take the trip alone for a long weekend to represent the both of us.

Now that the day is approaching my wife is getting extremely anxious and nervous about me leaving. We lost our first pregnancy at 12 weeks, which I'm sure is adding to her anxiety, but she is currently 26 weeks pregnant with twins and everything is looking great.

My wife keeps telling me it's fine she'll be ok and go and have a good time, but her body language and tears have said different. She has her family that lives 10 minutes from us so I asked her mom to keep her company and stay over if need be. My MIL is on board and told me to go, enjoy myself and my wife will be fine.

While I know everything will be fine I can't help but feel like TA here leaving my pregnant wife home alone. I felt bad enough I offered to cancel my flight and drive the both of us down, which in hindsight was probably the choice I should have made early on, but she refuses to take off the two needed days from work and says she'll be ok.

First some important information:
Our family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister ""gave her to me"" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. 

So, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said ""hello I missed you"" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat ""Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?"" 
I got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. 
While I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom ""no Lux is not her cat"". Then my sister began to say that ""Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move"". 
At this point I got very angry and said almist crying that ""I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me"". Then my mom stopped me by shouting ""YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER!

I'm a music freak, I play just about every instrument I can get my hands on (probably poorly). I love music, and my biggest passions are bass and guitar. With that out of the way, the story begins with me asking out this girl I like in college, Alyssa. She seemed thrilled and readily accepted. 

Things were fine, until I got the lead on the (bass) guitar of my dreams being sold, for an outrageous price. The guy only had time yesterday, when the date was gonna take place. I had a fair bit of anxiety, but realized I couldn't pass up this guitar, since this opportunity most likely is a once in a lifetime thing. 

I've always got a fair bit of money stashed away for gear purposes, and off I went to get my dream guitar. It was beautiful, played great and I bought it on the spot. I hurried back to the place we were gonna meet, only to be met with Alyssa, all dressed up and super pissed. 

She noticed my guitar case, and was like ""So this is what you pick over me, huh?"" and just walked away looking pissed. I went home, tried my new guitar out. She texted me not long after going ""you're such an asshole, I was looking forward to this so much, and you blew it.""

She went on a tirade about how she's apparently had a crush on me since last year, and how I'm just a self-absorbed asshole for picking (my dream guitar since childhood) over her. I tried saying sorry but she hung up. I'm thinking about letting her cool off and asking for another date.

Generally, it's a fly in on a Sunday night work Monday, Tuesday, and leave Thursday. And, generally most of the work in done early Wednesday.

So, last week it's me and this woman I work with were on the hook for this latest deploy. We've worked together for years and are pretty good friends. My wife has always been hesitant of the friendship but never outright said I had to stop being friends.

Like severely ill and I'm like asking is she ok and she's like she needs to go to the doctor now. She had apparently fell asleep at 7pm and was just waking up. 

Long story short. Email the job let them know the situation. Take her to the doctor. Flu. 103F fever. Dehydrated. I drop her back off at the hotel with her prescription, fluids, fever meds, and her cell phone charging beside her.

In my perspective, this isn't necessarily ""lying"" per se, as much as it is the omission of irrelevant details. 

My primary reason for this is that I have been criticized before (particularly by men) claiming that I'm entitled for thinking they ""want me"" because I told them I was in a relationship straight-up. 

This has been an area of contention for me because, on one hand, it does seem a bit odd to disclaim that outright, but on the other hand, I have gotten shit for ""leading people on,"" if I don't reveal my relationship status early on in a conversation.

My boyfriend is uncomfortable by my decision to keep our relationship relatively private unless I am asked/the context permits it, but he also has a better sense of intuition than I do.

0,"AITA for wanting to rehome my dog? | I apologize in advance, this is quite lengthy.

Background: I (18f) have had my dog for 8 years. While he is technically the family dog,  I have paid for all his needs (food, supplies, pet insurance, etc) and I’m the only one who feeds and walks him (but he still gets love and attention from the rest of my family). I’m perfectly okay with this setup since it was what we agreed to when my parents allowed me to adopt him. This fall, I’ll be attending a school hours away from my home and I can't take the dog with me. I had originally planned to attend a school nearby so that I would still be able to live at home, but some unexpected issues came up.

While I would love nothing more than for my dog to be able to live at home with my family even when I’m gone, I don’t think they will be able to adequately care for him. My parents work most of the day and it would be difficult for them to contribute, and my sister (13f) just isn’t interested in the responsibility portion that comes with having a pet. I have plans to give him to some of our family friends that live just a couple streets away from us- they just lost their beloved dog last year and are looking to adopt. They are very close to us and my dog absolutely adores them, he has known them his whole life. They have dog-sat multiple times and are in a position where they would be able to take very good care of him. Since they are practically like family, we see them all the time just for dinners and stuff. If my dog was to go live with them, I know my family would be able to see him whenever they wanted.

I talked it over with my parents, and although they aren’t super happy about it they understand and say that it’s ultimately my choice. My sister on the other hand is absolutely livid with me. I completely agree why she would be upset, but she has made no effort to step up to the plate to actually take care of him. I’ve given her multiple trial weeks where I’ll ask her to be responsible for the dog’s basic needs, and every single time she hasn’t put in effort. I’ll have to remind her multiple times when it’s walk or feeding time, but she still did it only when she felt like it, if even at all. I had to pick up her slack every single week we tried. I’m worried when I’m not there, it’ll be even worse with no one reminding her. The dog shouldn’t have to suffer.

Right now I’m pretty convinced rehoming will be what’s best for my dog, but my sister still isn't happy. She has brought up the fact that I’d be taking away the only home and family my dog has ever known, and to her the dog she’s had for as long as she can remember.

I didn't own a suit, and wanted to know if slacks and a button down would be too casual. I had plenty of money to be able to afford a suit, and as an adult man it would be reasonable for me to have one anyway.  He told me that it would be totally fine, I didn't need a suit. 

Flash forward to the night before we leave for the wedding, we're packing and I notice he's packing a suit.  I said I thought we didn't need suits and he said I'd still be fine without one, but he was going to wear one.  This got me concerned that I'd be really underdressed.  I asked him if he could please not wear a suit, since I still didn't have one and had no way to get one in time.  I assumed this would be fine, since he told me it'd be okay not to wear one in the first place.  He probably just didn't realize that I'd feel a lot more comfortable: I knew that if we were dressed to the same level, I'd feel less out of place (you know, solidarity and all that). I didn't know anyone at the wedding and am just self conscious about being over/under dressed to things generally.  To my surprise, he outright refused.  He said HE'D feel underdressed and out of place at a wedding without a suit. We argued about it for awhile, and at the end of the day he still refused to dress down at all.

This hurt my feelings quite a bit because it felt like he was choosing appearances over my feelings.  Essentially he'd rather me feel underdressed than him, even when he told it'd be fine in the first place.  If he wouldn't feel comfortable without a suit, why would he tell me I'd be okay without one? I couldn't (and still don't) understand--if the roles were reversed, I'd dress down in a heartbeat.

I recognize that this is a small deal, it sounds silly even writing it, but to me that almost makes it worse--I was having a ton of anxiety about it, and it seems like such a small thing for him to just dress down to the level he told me was reasonable.

In other words, the tofu from Chipotle is uncomfortably spicy for me, but I can just force it down.  Anything spicier than that is an absolute no go for me.  When I was a teenager, my family was eating at a Mexican restaurant, and I ordered food that ended up being way spicier than I anticipated.  I tried making myself eat it, only to eventually have to leave the restaurant and compose myself in the parking lot because I was having chest pain.  Ever since then, I've promised myself that I would never eat food that is too spicy for me again.  If I buy food that ends up being unexpectedly spicy, then I just throw it away and eat the cost (pun intended).

I'm in my late 20s now and have never had an issue with this approach.  This past Saturday my girlfriend's parents invited us over for dinner.  We've been dating for about six months now, and this was my first time meeting them.  When we arrived, they had prepared this complicated noodle dish with red sauce and chicken (not sure what it was called, but they're Korean if that helps).  I took one bite and immediately realized that I couldn't eat it.  I said, ""I appreciate the amount of effort that you guys have clearly put into this meal, but unfortunately it's just too spicy for me.  I can't eat it, but I'm more than happy to sit here and have a conversation while everyone else eats and then just get McDonald's on the way home.""

Things got a little awkward after that, and once the evening finally wrapped up and my girlfriend and I got in the car to drive home, she said that she was upset with me for ""insulting"" her parents by not eating the food that they spent four hours preparing specifically for me.  I reiterated that it was too spicy for me and that I refused to force myself to eat food that causes me literal physical pain.  She said that it wasn't even that spicy and called me a baby, to which I replied that everyone has difference tolerances for this sort of thing and that not only can I not help it but that it's also never going to change.  She was so aggravated that I didn't even get my McDonald's and had to eat a peanut butter and jelly after we got home.

It's been several days, and she's still upset about this, but I maintain that I did nothing wrong and would handle the situation the same way if it came up again in the future.  Am I somehow in the wrong here?",False,False,4,3,2,1,1,3,Care

So here’s the thing, me and my husband are going on a trip together soon. It’s actually the very first trip we take together. He has a hard, manual labor job and very rarely has time off. And when he does it never matches mine, because I have a regular 9-5 job. 

We are both very excited about our first vacation together, since we didn’t even get to have a honeymoon. Thing is, my husband is insisting in contributing equally to the cost of the trip. 

He comes from a very poor background and is used to pretty much nothing and having to work his ass off his whole life for what he has. 
I admire this very very much, but we don’t live in those conditions anymore. I have a great job and I make really good money, so I am comfortable paying for a large percentage of the trip. 

For a bit of context on the trip: we live in Europe and we are planning on going to a small, European capital. The places I’m looking to book are not ridiculously expensive, just regular b&b’s somewhere in the city, with little to nothing included. Something simple because we don’t really need much. 

On my husbands budget, best we could afford would be something like a hostel with shared rooms and bathrooms. Which is not a bad place, but for a first husband and wife vacation I think I’d like a bit of privacy with him... 

I was thinking in telling him that I got a really good “advance purchase” deal and say that the price was much cheaper than what I am actually paying for. 

I don’t want my husband to feel bad about himself on something has little as money, I understand why he feels like this and that’s why I don’t want to insist in paying and make him feel like “he is living off of me” (his words). He contributes so much to the household and works so hard, I couldn’t care less about who makes more or less money because I know we are both very invested in each other. 

Also, it’s not like I’m putting us in debt or asking for loans. I have more than enough to afford this on my savings account.

1,"AITA for stopping a D&D campaign because my gf's parents didn't like the game? | Hello reddit.

 Please excuse my poor english skills.

 A while ago (about 3 or so months) me, my bf (best friend ) and my gf started playing dnd through text. We were having fun and always looked forward to the next session. So we were playing the game as usual, and as the session ended, I texted my gf saying goodnight and all. She went to sleep soon after. 

For the next day, she didn't come online at all. That kinda freaked me out a bit, but I carried on. Next day - same thing. And then the next. On the end of the third day, she finally texted me saying that she's back in black and all that. I obviously asked why she didn't come online for so long, to which she replied by saying that her parents came in and started asking what she was doing on the phone so late (she's 16 and we ended the session around midnight). She told them about Dungeons and Dragons. For some reason, they were horrified. They probably saw something very addicting in dnd which led to swift and obvious parental conclusions. They were drawing parallels with gambling, drugs and so on. They said that they aren't going to make us break up for now, but want her to be careful with things like this in the future. Then they took away her devices for 3 days.

 I told her that we can stop playing. Obviously not before we play out a final session in order to make her character leave the story, as she was pretty attached to her little halfling warlock. But she insisted on continuing to play, saying that she can try to hide dnd from her parents. Which was suboptimal to me, because I didn't want to risk her losing access to the internet and lose touch with her for another few days in case she failed to hide well. I came to a conclusion that it's no use trying to convince her to stop, as she really wanted to continue. So I decided to do a bit of underhanded manipulation. I thought that the ends justified the means. I texted my bf saying what I just said in the last paragraph. I asked him to try and come up with an excuse to leave the campaign. He was a bit upset about this, but in the end he understood that his fellow player's well being is on the line here. So he did just that. He left the story in such a way, that continuing without him would be impossible.

I told her I was definitely interested and the mom and I arranged a time for her son and I to go out to get lunch. I drove over to the boy’s house to find out he was the same age as me (previously thinking he would be around 10/11 age). The boy definitely had a lot of anxiety and was a little awkward. I asked him what his mom told him about me and he said, “that I messaged his mom and I was looking to hangout with someone and do fun things because I am lonely.” After we awkwardly hung out for a couple of hours, the mom told me not to come meet her as she doesn’t want him to know that she and I are still in contact. She then PayPaled me $20/hour for hanging out with her son. She asked me if my friends and I were interested in all hanging out with him and getting paid. We all did this a few times and individually got paid the same hourly rate. After a few times, I found this to be saddening. As someone who struggles with anxiety, I would be destroyed if I ever found out that my only friends were getting paid to hangout with me by my mom. But would definitely want to know this to grow and not feel so blinded and sheltered.

My girlfriend (then fiancée) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

Now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that I’ve never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. She left me with my grandma and I was raised by her since birth. I have always and will always consider my grandma my real “mother”  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

About a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn’t have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer’s help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

Fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma’s condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. My uncles and I immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

She doesn’t pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. I called my fiancée multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. Not only was I not in the best state of mind (again, she’s my mother to me) but I needed to be by her side when she passed. I felt sick at the idea of not being there when I could.

My fiancée was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted I get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and I understand that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in me being there since she won’t even know I’m there due to her dementia. I understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn’t matter if she realised I was there or not. I just felt I had to be there with my uncles. 

She ended up passing the night of my wedding. My fiancée didn’t talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. She said I was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as my fiancée she should take top priority no matter what.

For April fools day yesterday, as a “joke,” he decided to hide the pain medication I take to deal with my periods. I have horrible periods, especially the first couple days (which yesterday was) and the pain can be debilitating and make me cry if I don’t have the pain meds to help (even then, I still have pain, I’m just able to function).

I basically couldn’t find them all day yesterday then this morning he gave them to me and said “April Fools!!” His prank was hiding this on me since I “relied on them so heavily and need to see I don’t need pain meds to get through the day.” He said that’s what I get for keeping the meds in the kitchen (which I do because they need to be taken with food and/or water) 

I was fucking pissed. He saw me crying and wincing in pain and hid them from me? I told him to fuck off and that this would be the last conversation we’d have for a while. I’m ignoring him but he keeps texting me like “come on really?” And giving ME dirty looks in the hallway like I’m the one who did something wrong.

1,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to leave a concert early? | My Background : I am a police officer and used to work in a very active jail dealing with junkies. I am also very much in love with my girlfriend and have talked about marriage. 

Background of the issue : My girlfriend and her friend (two females) went to a concert which I have no issue with. I work crazy hours and don’t get to spend as much time with my friends/family,  so I’m perfectly ok with her hanging out with her friends. 


The problem: A few days before the concert she told me that her friend would be the designated driver. One of the first post to her Snapchat was them both with large mixed drinks. This is where I start worrying, my girlfriend says that there is hardly an alcohol in the drinks, that they are over priced, and that her and her friend would be leaving soon. This was around 7pm. Around 8:30-9:00pm she is still posting snapchats about the concert so I ask about it and she says that another performance came on. Then she tells me there is cocaine at the concert. Now I’m maximum worry, as the experience from the job tells me where this cocaine there normally follows other drugs. Not to mention having fought with junkies, I know I personally would not like to be in a situation where people are snorting coke around me as it can be very dangerous. I am also aware that there is only two of them and worried as my girlfriend told me she had been roofied a few years ago. I ask her to leave the concert for her safety. She then tells me if I want to her hide in the bathroom so she can miss the show, I tell her that I don’t want her to separate from her friend and that I’m very much worried for both of them.  She then calls me and says that I need to chill out, and I’m over reacting. At this point she had been rude with me and I told she was being disrespectful.  I never called her any names and was trying to tell that I trusted her, but it was the other people using drugs/selling drugs that I was worried about. She ended up staying the full time, then called me. She called me a dick for asking her to leave and ruining her night. I explained to her that I was on duty and need to focus and would like to talk to her about the issue at a better time but she kept trying to push the issue. I just asked her to let me know when she got home safely and has now ignored me. The time is now 3:30am where I am and I have not heard from her since she left.  I am still extremely worried about her as I have no idea she made it home.  She also stated to that she wouldn’t tell me about it next time and that had she not told me about the drugs she would have a great night. I am not sure if her silence is her being vindictive... 


TLDR: girlfriend went to concert, said she would leave at 7, stayed till 9ish, said there was cocaine, I asked to her leave because of the danger, she stayed till the end, then tried to start an argument while I was at work, I asked to table it till a better time, she didn’t want to, I asked to let me know when she got home,  no reply back.

1,"AITA for accepting a bribe to not sell someone cigarettes? | I’m a clerk at one of only three places in a pretty small town that’s open right now and sells tobacco products. 

 Recently an older woman came in and said she recognized I was the one usually working there in the hours her husband buys cigarettes and he’s been repeatedly warned his health is in jeopardy if he doesn’t quit, so if she gives me $500, would I agree to never sell him another cigarette. 

I needed $500, and I’ve lost family to complications of smoking, so I said sure. I took the money and his photo. 

But here’s the dilemma. Today he came in. He seemed really bent out of shape and was definitely in the throes or nicotine withdrawal. He demanded I sell him a cigarette. I told him I couldn’t (and explained what had happened) and said he should go home and talk to his wife directly. 

He said he was aware of what his wife had gone around doing but he’d bid her up if I revoked the ban. I said that wouldn’t be fair to his wife and he really needed to talk to her about it. Eventually he left, since I was the only one in the store, so there was no one else to complain to. 

He came back again today and begged me to sell him any cigarette, and even tried to bum one off a loiterer. I felt really bad for the guy. 

He’s an adult and I’m starting to wonder if I’m an asshole for accepting the lady’s deal in the first place. He should be able to make his own decisions and his addiction really isn’t my business.

0,"WIBTA for letting my 3yo nephew go into foster care? | Quick back story: The child’s mother (my wife’s sister) is addicted to meth and is a prostitute and the father has been ghost his entire life. The mother abandoned him and left him with their other sister whom she was living with at the time. The other sister eventually got fed up with the situation and basically told my wife that either we can take him or she will call CPS and let them handle it. This took place in Arizona which has a notoriously bad foster care system which usually ends up in abuse, so we couldn’t let that happen. We decided to take him for the time being.

Fast forward to now, my wife and I are at our wits end. We have 3 children of our own that we are struggling to provide for, we are currently co-living with my Mom and splitting rent/bills because we are not financially secure. My nephew was also born addicted to methadone and we’ve noticed some potential development issues coming to the surface. He can’t speak very well for his age, he doesn’t understand potty training, very destructive, whiny and just very difficult in general. I’ve seen my wife break down several times and cry because she just isn’t equipped to deal with it. It’s also taking a toll on my kids who have started to resent him, even though they may be picking that up from me and their mother. We love him, we want the best for him, but I don’t think we can provide it for him.  We don’t want to be angry with him or take out our frustrations on him because none of this is his fault, but we can’t do this anymore. We decided that we would look into other options, but there is nobody else in the family that can or will take him. The parents are MIA and the other sister said no because she needs to put her family first, which I understand. So this leaves us with the option of getting the state involved and letting him go into the system (in Texas). Just the thought of this makes me sick to my stomach and I don’t know if I could live with the guilt. But I also know that we can’t live like this any longer.

0,"AITA for getting my friend suspended? | Background: I (14F) am a paraplegic. My 'friend' (16M) was very supportive through the initial injury. We knew each other in middle school and we were friends before I was injured. 

After my injury, the first thing he asked me was if I wished I were dead. I honestly don't really remember what I said, and then after that, he asked a lot of very personal questions about things. About what still works and what doesn't. It felt really weird as I was 13 at the time and I didn't really want to think about those things with him. He's been a bit odd about everything for the past year and gets really defensive when I ask him if he could stop asking such personal questions. 

Last week in English Class, we were having a class discussion about euthanasia. He not so subtly implied that people like me should be euthanized to save taxpayers money (basically said how disabled people are a waste of resources, it was quite rude) and I started getting a bit emotional and had to leave the room to collect myself. My English teacher is actually really nice and asked to speak to me after class and asked if I was alright and then spoke some words of encouragement. At that point, I completely broke down and told her about how my friend had repeatedly made me uncomfortable and I explained everything. 

Yesterday I got a text from him saying that what I did was 'super not cool' and a few of his friends confronted me and asked why I got so mad about a joke. I never officially reported him or anything but I'm guessing my English teacher probably talked to administration about everything. He was suspended for two days and he and his friends are all really pissed, and he keeps insisting it's all just a joke.

Honestly, I'm a bit glad that he got in trouble. It felt like there wasn't much that I could really say or do when he asked me really weird questions even after I asked him to stop, and I  hope that this will make him stop doing that sort of stuff. But a bunch of his friends are really mad at me.

I was hesitant to let her have my access info, because I didn’t want James to possibly have access to my account and do an asshole move like change my password or sign me up for something that I have to pay for, just because he likes to cause trouble for my sister and her family and friends, by association.

I didn’t feel comfortable with this, so I told her no. She has constantly been texting me, begging me for the password. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong here.

She decided to have her first drink ever and throughout the night she had more, though not a lot in my opinion (but I could be wrong considering her weight and other factors).

She’s been acting kind of weird all night, but not really drunk, more just awkward. She’d had about 4 shots and was seemingly sober when she came to me and said that she was acting weird because she could blame it on the alcohol and I didn’t really mind the statement since she wasn’t really whoring herself out for attention or anything, just being goofy.

She gets served a full glass of vodka but finished maybe a third and starts getting emotional. I laugh (mostly because I’ve had some to drink and I knew she would be embarrassed the next day). She starts crying and just letting loose so much about her life. She’s frustrated about a lot of things like her grandparents health and a crush she has. She was also stressed because she thought I was mad at her (I wasn’t, just sick at texting and getting back to people if they don’t really attempt to talk to me).

It gets to the point where we take her for a drive around town so she could get some fresh air and she begins to break down HEAVY. She’s sobbing and venting about things but quickly starts talking about how much the people in the car mean to her. 

It’s just my other friend Lily and her boyfriend Rob, but she starts talking about how Lily is such a good friend to her and how Rob (who she’d met for the first time an hour earlier) was one of her good friends and how she hoped he wanted to be her friend. The part where I got unnerved was she said nothing about me.

I know that might sound selfish and conceited but I’ve always agreed with “drunk words are sober thoughts” and I guess it just made me think that my friendship with her didn’t really matter that much to her. I was in the backseat with her and with her during the party, watching out for her and making sure she was fine. I was crying with her in the car when she was breaking down because I truly felt for her situation and I felt horribly, while Lily and Rob were laughing at her. I’d been friends with her for 7 years now and I thought that I’d have at least gotten a mention. I talked to her every day for month long periods and I just thought we were close.

Her team leader had gone straight to the seminar so I didn't have an opportunity to speak to him about it, and I suspect my manager would not have allowed the switch anyway as I had quite a bit of work to catch up on after being sick.

After the seminar, my colleague was still visibly upset. I tried to apologise but she didn't want to hear it. I spoke to another colleague about it and she suggested that I had been a ""shitty friend"". This caught me off guard as I knew I had made a mistake but didn't think it was that big.

My colleague and I are now on speaking terms again but it feels awkward. She also (half) jokingly mentioned that I was #1 on her shit list temporarily for the whole thing which made me feel like a shitty person. I didn't go into how I felt about it all because it would only make things worse.

When we first got together I made it clear that sharing a bed with the kids is a boundary of mine. It caused his last marriage to have a dead bedroom issue & ultimately ended it, & I do not want that same situation for us. So whenever me & the daughter are there at the same time, before bed I clarify with BF that ""she will be sleeping in her own bed tonight, right?"" (which is literally right next door to his bedroom) He says yes & puts her to bed. He really is good with his kids & I think it is sweet. But by 2am she will wake up scared & comes into our room to wake dad up. He gets up & goes to sleep with her in her bed to help her get back to sleep. But when he does that he ends up sleeping in there the entire night! This happens Every. Single. Night.

I just want to sleep next to my big warm man & snuggle. It is so comforting to me to reach over & feel him next to me. I feel that the only reason she can't sleep by herself is because her dad has gotten her accustomed to sleeping with him. She knows that if she wakes him up, he will go lay with her. So I suggested that instead of laying with her, to maybe start weaning her off of sleeping with him & instead just go in to her room, kiss her/comfort her & tell her that daddy is right in the next room & that she is safe. It seemed like a reasonable request because he has told me before that he wants her to start sleeping by herself & that she is too old to sleep with him now.

But when I suggested that, he got so angry at me @ 3:30am. He started yelling at me telling me that I don't understand because I don't have kids bla bla bla. What he seems to forget is that I was a 6yo girl once, & I am a female who was born with a maternal instinct. & it hurt because I try to be a good role model/affectionate mother figure (I would not try to replace their mother) to his children. I know he loves his children dearly & I wouldn't ever want that to change. But I really think it is time for her to be weaned off of sleeping in our bed. AITA for feeling this way? Am I really being insensitive to her needs?

TLDR BF's 6yo (almost 7) daughter is so used to sleeping in dads bed that she will refuse to sleep alone in her room right next door to ours. She wakes BF/dad up & he goes to sleep with her leaving me cold & lonely just about every night. AITA for suggesting that he weans her off of sleeping in bed with him?",False,False,4,2,1,3,1,3,Care
0,"WIBTA for not wanting to give up an expensive gift? | I (M21) was recently given a set of wireless ear buds, the type that hang over the ear. A coworker that im close with gave them to me as a gift since he didnt like/use them. These are expensive ones that he was otherwise going to sell online if i didnt want them. 


The problem is this. Upon coming home and telling my mother about it and how nice it was for him to gift them to me, she asked, which then became practically begging me to give them to her after i had initially said no. She had gone on to say that she never got to have nice headphones/listenjling apparatus and how she had gotten me nice things in the past. 


I didnt really want to give them up, but i also felt guilty about keeping something nice from her. She's someone who's worked very hard to give me a good upbringing and right now we're both working to pay for expenses between the two of us.

mobile sorry and my sister is 4. 

Today I unfortunately woke up late at 730 and I was willing to take my sister a bit late to school (we ride the bus). I head into the shower and hop out at around 8. I start getting dressed and I’m just about ready I just needed to find my shoes. I go out and look for my sister so we can both put on my shoes. I start looking around in the living room, my mom’s room, and even the room I changed in. The only person there was my nana. I didn’t think much of it and just left thinking my mom took her school. 

I get to school at 915 my class starts at 930. I am in my class early so I can do an important project that was due today. I’m in class and I get a text from my mom at 918 asking if I had my sister almost at school.

I call her cause this was about to be a big problem and I couldn’t just text her that I didn’t have my sister. So I’m calling her and she picks up asking me what’s up. I tell her I don’t have my sister and I never did. I told her that when I got out the shower no one was there but nana. Now she was upset with me. She said that she was my responsibility in the mornings. I told her that how can I know where she’s at while I’m in the shower. How can I possibly know the whereabouts of everyone in the house while in the shower. I tell her I thought she took my sister to school and she says no.

She asks where I’m at and I tell her I’m at school. She tells me that I needed to head home and find my sister . I tell her I can’t do that cause I have a project due for that class and I’ll lose points on it. She then says that my sister should be my one priority and that it doesn’t matter. 

So I get up and leave. I start heading to the bus stop and call my nana cause she was still home,  her and ask if my sister was still home she says no. I start listing off all the places I looked before I left she says she’s not home. She starts getting worried and I tell her my sister is missing. So now she’s making a fuss. 


She hangs up telling me my mom is calling to I start dialing my little brother who would be the last person who saw her before the house got empty. He tells me that she was laying down asleep in mom’s bed and I tell him no one was in mom’s room. He tells me ok and I tell him I’m going to go find her. I hang up and get ready to call the police when my mom sent a “call me NOW” text.

I call my mom again and ask what’s going on. She tells me that my sister is at school and that she took her this morning. I tell her that she just wasted my time and I was about to call the cops. I tell I missed an important end of semester assignment and that I worried my brother and my nana. 

She said it was my fault because I should’ve known where my sister was at and that I need to learn how to take responsibility better. I was so pissed. I told her she was being ridiculous and obnoxious and that because of her little test I failed a class.

1,"WIBTA for telling my sister to stop talking about “outgrowing” Planet Fitness? | A little over two years ago, my identical twin sister and I (f20) graduated high school, and we started attending the local community college. It was undergoing major renovations, so they gave us free memberships to Planet Fitness. And basically, if you went three-four times a week, they gave you your PE credit for the semester. We have had to pay for the past year, though. 

So anyway, I started going three times a week to different classes, and my sister started going four times a week and  lifting weights. She started with the 1 lb weights. They’re cute. Then, after about six months, she started adding assisted pull-ups. She’s kept adding more and more weight, both to the lifts and to pull-ups. At some point she started doing trenching for splits and stuff.

She managed to do unassisted pull-ups a week or so ago, and she’s been using the heaviest dumbbells for like three months. She’s cancelled her membership at the end of the month. And that’s fine. 

But the way she talks about why is really offensive. She says she can’t really progress much more at PF, and she’s met all the goals she had for it. Now she wants to focus on advanced callisthenics. And even though it gave her a good foundation, it’s not useful. When people compliment her, she says things like it’s not really hard once you dedicate yourself.

The recommended amount is about 20$. 

I decided that I'd like to give a 20$ donation to a reputable charity (environmental or animal rights/shelter) and give the confirmation of such given amount in their name on paper to my giftee. I decided to do that because some people received pretty shitty gifts last year (me included) and this is something that will do good and has a zero chance of ending up in the trash or some drawer. 

However, my concern is that it may be unfair to give to a charity that I consider a good charity (because it may seem like I wanted to give to a charity, but also needed a gift, so I combined them and didn't really take the wish of my giftee into consideration). Also I will be receiving a regular gift most likely, but will be giving a non-material gift to someone else. I'd love to receive the same instead of some crap like last year, but that's unfortunately not possible.

My son in law was something of a wild child when he was young which made parenting a teenage girl quite difficult, and my husband can’t seem to realize the boy isn’t 17 anymore.

I don’t go into anaphylaxis or need an epi-pen, it’s a very mild reaction except for it can stick with me for days afterwards. The most notable is my tomato allergy. It’s high in citric acid (the main issue) and causes blisters in my mouth that can fill with blood and bust for weeks after I eat something with tomato in it and they just don’t heal up quickly because I sort of have to keep eating even if they’re there. Don’t get me wrong, I love pizza, marinara sauce and the like but there will ALWAYS be a price to pay afterwards. Sometimes I’m just more equipped to deal with it than others, and it’s very small amounts can cause the blisters. 

With this, the other day my friends and I went to a fast food place and I just wanted a cheeseburger with extra cheese, lettuce, and mayo. Usually I like ketchup but today I didn’t think I could handle the blisters so I skipped it. When I got my order, there was tomato on it, which is no big deal. I took it up and asked them to remake it and went to sit down. Except when I was called up almost a minute later they handed me my food which was very fast for a remake. After I sat down I checked and, sure enough, I could see a seed that came from the tomato they had just picked off which was an issue because the juice it left behind alone is enough to cause the blisters. 

I took it back up and told them that I needed them to remake it and not just pick off the tomato, that it already defeated the purpose by coming in contact with the rest. The cashier tried to argue with me that it wasn’t a real allergy since tomato wasn’t in their allergen book (it’s a relatively uncommon allergy, I’ll admit) and that there was no reason to remake it. From here I told her I wanted to talk to her manager and a refund since I just wanted to go somewhere that wasn’t going to try and force me to eat an allergen. She’s mad but she gets her manager and after about twenty minutes of arguing with him he gives me the refund and says I can keep the burger I already had (I threw it out because I can’t eat it).

When I told him that I didn’t want to get an abortion, he got really upset and said I got pregnant on purpose to try and trap him because I knew he was going out of the country (he’s in the Army), I just wanted his money and how I should prepare to be a single mother, be on section 8, welfare, food stamps etc. then proceeded to threaten me. Carlos told me he did not want his mom to know about the baby then blocked me from both of their social media profiles.

While Carlos was getting ready to leave the country, he was staying with his mom in a different state. Then, he tells me the Army changed his orders and he’s now going to be stationed in a state off the mainland and living there permanently. At this point, we were still arguing sometimes, but not as often as before. Carlos also tells me he still hasn’t told his mom and still wasn’t planning on doing so. 

He tells me he wants to know when I go into labor, when I’m at the hospital, and when the baby is born and if everything’s fine. I agree and do that. For the first few weeks after our daughter was born, we were getting along great and weren’t arguing at all. 

A couple months go by, Carlos and I are still getting along so I make the suggestion that he should meet his daughter. He seems to be open to me flying with our daughter to stay with him for about a week. We start to make plans for us to go in the summer, but he wouldn’t be able to pay for anything because he just moved into an apartment/condo and his rent is an insane amount and he barely has any money. I tell him I would be willing to pay for the ticket to go out there and at first he says no, but then comes around to the idea. After this, it seems to me he started trying to find any and every reason to start an argument. I finally say that I’ve had enough and tell him I’m done and I’m not going to come out there and I’m not going to send him anymore pictures of our daughter until he can apologize to me for the way he’s been treating me.

 I blocked him on every other social media and I filed for child support. Carlos is now telling some of his friends that I am crazy, I’m keeping his daughter away from him and he doesn’t fully believe that she’s his daughter. He still hasn’t told his mom as far as I know, so I tried reaching out to her twice, both times I didn’t hear anything back from her. 

My daughter is now 6 months old and next week I have to take her out to do a paternity test. I have been feeling like a real dick for filing for child support after saying I wouldn’t in the beginning of my pregnancy. I gave him over a year to come around and today I’ve been feeling like I did this all too soon.

1,"AITA for getting up in the middle of a haircut and walking out without paying because I didn't trust the hair stylist? | I'm a woman with long, thick hair, always cut with long layers. It's always been one of my best features and I get lots of compliments on it. After a brief period in high school where I foolishly spent over a hundred dollars per haircut because that was the cool thing to do, I grew up and realized that the cheap places cut my hair just as well. So, for the last twenty years or so, I have been going to Great Clips and Supercuts for cheap haircuts. I am always very happy with the results. I am not overly concerned with how each stylist I see does it a little different, because it always just seems to look fine. 

Recently I popped into Great Clips to get a haircut. The only person there was this young woman who seemed very hesitant and inexperienced. When she was washing my hair and doing the nape of my neck, I sort of lifted my head up slightly to allow her easier access, as I always do. She reprimanded me and insisted that I rest the full weight of my head on her one hand while she washed with the other hand. It did not feel normal or right to me to have her supporting my head with her hand. I thought that was odd, especially since she had been so timid before, but whatever. And she didn't towel-dry my hair very much, she left it sopping wet, which was also very strange. 

Then when we went back to the chair, she combed it out and then had me stand up while she started cutting. I have never been asked to stand up before, ever. This combined with her uncertain movements had me feeling very concerned. I tried to tell myself that she wouldn't be working there if she didn't know what she was doing, and it would be just fine. However, I couldn't take it so after maybe ten minutes I just told her ""I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable having you cut my hair. You don't seem like you know what you're doing, and I've never been asked to stand up before in my life. This just feels really weird. I'm going to go."" 

She seemed shocked and dismayed and didn't say a word. We were still the only two people in the whole place, so I just left with my hair wet. I didn't offer to pay or leave a tip, and I went directly to another place down the street and got my hair cut in the normal way, by what felt like a competent person, sitting down.

Looking back, I feel like I was maybe a little too hasty or harsh. Who knows how that impacted her self-esteem and confidence with cutting hair? On the other hand, I really didn't feel comfortable and am not going to subject myself to something I am so uncomfortable with.

1,"AITA for advising my friend to work instead of being a trophy wife? | My friend and I graduated nursing school this spring. For the past 3 years, she's been dating a professional athlete, who is also in his early 20s. They got engaged in December and are planning to marry in August. He is wealthy for his age, but despite that he's a very sweet and grounded guy with a promising career in front of him. They are truly in love. I am going to be one of her bridesmaids.

Yesterday, I asked about where she planned to work. She said she's ""not sure"" and said that she wants to wait until after she gets married to see. With her fiance's job, there's a lot of moving around every few years. She says she really wants to start a family with him and focus on that, maybe get a part-time job or work from home (e.g. telehealth). He is also fine with this, and in fact encourages it.

I told her that it's her life and her choices, but that it would be wise if she established a proper career as well. She still hasn't gotten her license yet. I asked her if her parents were okay with her wanting to be a trophy wife, and she got offended. She said that they want her to be happy above anything, and she's not even sure if she wants to be a nurse. I said that she should at least try, given all the hard work and effort she put into getting this degree. 

She was cold with me after our conversation. I definitely angered her, but I think someone needs to say this to her. Maybe I'm just an idealist, but I find it sad that she wants to be a trophy wife instead of using her skills to care for sick people. Plus, I came from a place of genuine love and concern.

My Sister turned 22 last weekend, but had her birthday party planned for today. She was extremely nervous the entire week, wondering what she'll wear and this and that, things that doesn't really interest a guy, at least i kinda find it a bit silly. 

So today she got up pretty early and started dressing herself for like the entire day, then, couple hours before she planned to go, she was fully dressed and came down stairs. About the same time my mom returned home from work, so we all were in the living room ( was just watching some Netflix). 

My sister then asked me who i think is looking better today, she or my mom. I thought it was a strange question and responded that I'm not the right person to Answer that, but she said that i shouldn't be a baby and just give an objective answer. 

So i said "" Fine..ehm mom's looking better"". 

And i didn't really think about it much, just gave an honest answer, but the backlash of it was immense. Her entire mood dropped to the floor, she started sobbing and told my mom that if she can't even outshine someone that didn't try, how will she look around the other girls. 

That went on for a couple hours and she ultimately left with a very bad mood. That wasn't my intention and i feel bad, she was looking forward to this day quite a bit. It's her first birthday party.

0,"AITA for telling people my dog is a rescue when he's not? | I have a 5 year old Border Collie (BC) who I adopted as a puppy from a Craigslist ad. To my knowledge he came from a happy home. 

For a first time dog parent I was proud of the amount of time and effort I put into socializing and training BC, and for the first 3 years of his life we were happy as could be. I felt incredibly lucky to have such easy going and eager to please first dog. 

Unfortunately 2 years ago at house party BC had a traumatizing encounter with a child that has caused him to become incredibly nervous and aggrey towards children. In retrospect I should have gotten him into training and addressed the trauma immediately. Instead I avoided children and he quarantined BC in a no-kids area when children were around. 

I recently moved and have started to take BC out and about to dog parks or to explore. BC is a handsome pup with ""hey -- you're my best friend in the whole world!"" energy so we're often approached, especially by children in his high-risk age group. 

When approached I usually something along the lines was of ""Oh, he doesn't like kids"", but half of the time the parent or child will just respond that it's okay, they're good with dogs and then they get snarled at. 

I was complaining to a friend with a rescue who's aggressive towards children as well and they said that they didn't have that experience becuase when they tell people their dog's a rescue and doesn't like kids trauma is assumed. 

When parents approach with there children I now say ""Sorry, he doesn't like kids he's a rescue"" then do the SNL Debbie Downer grimace, and it has decreased the number of snarling at kids incedents to almost never.

1,"AITA for going on holiday without my pregnant wife | My family had planned to travel for a cousin’s destination wedding. The wedding was cancelled, so we transferred the flights to a different holiday. 

Between the wedding being arranged and cancelled, my wife became pregnant (planned), so we chose a destination which was a relatively short flight and more of a chill city break than a grand tour. 

All has fine with the pregnancy, relatively speaking. Except with a recent scan we found that the placenta has embedded low. The doctors said it isn’t necessarily a risk on its own, and travelling wouldn’t increase any risk - but if anything was to go wrong, it could be fairly catastrophic (lots of bleeding etc) so they banned her from flying. 

As the holiday was booked with the rest of the family I had to decide whether I would go with them and leave my wife behind (with her family for company, who it has to be said would definitely spoil her - though they live an hour and a half’s drive away). 

My wife and I discussed it and decided that since there was no real risk to her or the baby’s health, and since she had a strong support network at home (and it was only a short flight back if anything did go wrong) then I could go, but it would be nice if I stayed. 

The holiday has come and gone without any issue, but I still can’t square in my mind whether I was an asshole to go. 

For context:

- We could have got a full refund on both of our flights and my family would have covered the cost of our accommodation (wife got a refund, we all covered her accommodation). 

- My wife is currently suffering from pelvic girdle pain which means she’s quite limited in terms of what she can do at home and out and about (though she did spend 5 hours shopping for baby gear with her mum, and I think had a nice time doing it). 

- We discussed doing nice things around our home city instead of the trip, but I pointed out this is a false dichotomy and we can still have a nice weekend in the city as well as the holiday.

Also it’s a good chance for them to be able to hang out with their biological dads since can meet them there for awhile after work.

Anyways, today there was a creepy liking dude. It hard to describe but you know when your gut a a mother is just tugging at you? Yep! Parental instinct. Examples were he was dressed in all white with red underwear showing through his clothes (frickin weird). He had sunglasses on and kept staring at the children. He also spent a lot of time on his phone but his fingers weren’t swiping so I’m pretty sure he was videotaping.

I actually approached him politely and said “which ones yours?” But he just stared at me and ignored me. I said again “hey man are you ok?” And he said “fine. Just fucking leave me alone lady”. Wtf who says that?!

I ended up calling the police and they walked him to the police car with cuffs on. And magically, no children with him. I ended up having to leave to run to the bank before it closed so I didn’t see what happened.

0,"AITA for acting annoyed that my Mom wore impractical shoes on a trip to NYC? | My Mom and I took a weekend trip to NYC. Before we left I saw that my Mom was wearing a pair of new wedge boots with a heel. I said “are those the best shoes? We’re going to be walking a to.” She said that she wanted to wear those shoes and she wanted to look nice. I said fine, I wasn’t going to fight my Mom over footwear.

We got to the city around lunchtime and walked a couple of blocks. She started complaining then that she was tired—not that her feet were hurting, that she was tired. So we took the subway and checked into the hotel early. She took a long nap. I didn’t want to putter around all by myself so I just played on my phone. When she woke up at around 6:00 p.m. she said we could go to the museum and get dinner now. I said the museum was closing too soon but we could get the dinner we planned and indicated where we needed to walk to get there. She said she was too tired to walk, I said we could get an Uber. She refused that because it was too expensive and also refused to have me pay for it. Instead, she said that her true desire was to get Five Guys for dinner (Five Guys was directly next to the hotel). I thought it was weird to come all the way to NYC to get Five Guys for dinner but I acquiesced. We got Five Guys and didn’t do anything else for the rest of the day. 

The next day, she said that her feet were hurting and she wanted to go to TJ Max to get shoes. So we went there. I have to admit I was feeling a little bit annoyed at this point. I guess it couldn’t be helped but I was annoyed that she wore impractical footwear, ignored the issue for hours of our trip, and then was spending literally hours at TJ Max trying on various shoes. She said to me, “are you okay? I’m not getting much of a vibe from you.” I said I was okay, it was just that TJ Max was not a thrill a minute for me.

We finally got shoes, but then, after we got them, she said she was too tired and her feet hurt too much to do anything else, so she said we should go home on the train. So we did.

We chose the neighborhood specifically because of all the activities for kids (a huge centralized park with playgrounds, native desert, a swimming pool and a skatepark). 

My kids have always wanted to try skateboarding so after we got them all set up with the appropriate equipment, I took them over to the skatepark at the park. For the most part it was an ok experience, but I wasn't a fan of the language the teens and preteens were using but I figured that was their ""turf"" and the last thing I needed to do was start an issue with them. 

However, there was a much older man there, he just creeped me out. I'm not sure how to describe it. He had pads and a skateboard but he only rode it maybe once every 10 minutes. But something about his look just seemed off to me. He also reeked of marijuana smoke. Finally he actually ran into my son while they were at the bottom of one of the pools and I had enough because it seemed so deliberate. I first asked him if he had kids, he said something really creepy like ""these are all my kids."" I said maybe it's time he found a new hobby. He was so incoherent I don't know what he said next but it was something about his ""soul"" which really creeped me out. So I told him flat out I think it's time that he left. He said he was leaving anyways in 20 minutes since he had to work. I told him maybe he should just leave now. He said no. I said I was calling the police and finally he said that he didn't want any trouble and he'd leave. I told him if he didn't want trouble maybe he should chose age appropriate activities. What I hadn't noticed is that several of the teens were close by and when he left they said things like ""maybe your fat ass should be the one to leave!"" and b-word and c-word and on and on. I had also brought over a specialty concert chair to sit on and one of the kids had thrown it over the fence into the main park.  This truly scared my kids. I dialed 911 and we left the park. It took almost 4 hours for the police to come to our house and the officer said that in the future I should call them right away.

0,"AITA for not translating for my mother in law? | This is more “are we the assholes” for myself and my husband.

For some background, my mother in law has been in America for over 25 years, however has very poor English as she only socializes with people who speak the same language as she does. Her ex husband (my husband’s father) speaks perfect English, as he went out of his way to learn it. The language they speak isn’t super common, and it would be unusual to meet someone in your day to day life that happened to speak it.

Due to this, she calls my husband for really stupid reasons. For example, she called him asking if he could call in a take-out order to a restaurant for her. She’ll speak to him in her first language and then he’ll translate it to me, rather than attempting to speak to me in English. I don’t mind this, but my husband gets irritated.

The other day, she calls my husband and says she got into a fender bender. We go to the scene because she was worried she wouldn’t be able to communicate with the police about what happened. Afterwards, she wouldn’t answer the insurance company’s calls, because she wanted to wait until we were around so that we could speak to them for her.

Additionally, she refuses to learn other things, such as ordering an Uber, leading us to have to leave work to take her to the airport, etc.

0,"AITA for assuming someone went to rehab for drugs? | So the other night I was at my SO’s work party and one of the guys brought his new girlfriend. It’s a really relaxed environment, we all just chilled at the office and ate dinner and drank a little bit. We all start breaking off into smaller groups having different conversations, and I start talking to 2 of the techs, one of whom is the one with the new girlfriend. A few minutes into the conversation the girlfriend walks up and I end up chatting with her and I ask her what she does for work.

She tells me she is a real estate agent but that she’s been out of work for a little while because she was in rehab. 

I was kind of taken aback that she was so open about something like that with people she just met but hey, some people are just like that. Good for her for getting clean, I’m sure I’d be proud of that too. That’s pretty much my entire thought process on this. My whole family has dealt with addiction and my mother even passed away a few years ago from an OD, so I’m no stranger to the demon that is drug addiction, nor am I someone who would pass judgement. 

I say to her “oh wow, it’s amazing that you completed the program. I’m so happy for you! How long have you been clean now?” I’d never usually ask such personal questions but I figured that she brought it up so she wouldn’t mind me asking.

She got this horrified look on her face and basically shrieked “WHAT? I meant *physical rehabilitation* not DRUG rehab!! What kind of person do you think I am??” 

I stuttered out a fast apology for the misunderstanding but she wouldn’t hear it and literally just turned and walked away from me. The rest of the night was super uncomfortable and she kept whispering to her boyfriend angrily and shooting me dirty looks the entire night. 

My SO got an angry text from coworker later that night saying how I offended his gf by assuming she was, and I quote, “a filthy drug addict” and that I owe her an apology. (I got really upset at that text because they acted like drug addicts are only homeless street rats when *plenty* of addicts live high functioning lives.)

My SO tried to explain my thinking, saying how I thought she meant drug rehab and not physical rehab and that it was an innocent mistake, but the coworker says that obviously someone I just met wouldn’t offhandedly mention they just got out of (drug) rehab and that my assumption was idiotic and offensive.

My son is 14 years old and sadly he has to stay at his mums house for now and can’t see me at all.

My biological mother was married to a man with whom she had two children. She then had an affair and I was the result of that. Her and her husband stayed together for a few years but when I was 5 they divorced. A lot of things happened in that time, but eventually we came to live with John (the husband). My half siblings are his biological children, while I was not. He never wanted me but he wanted to make my birth mother miserable, so he took custody of me too. 

He was not a very nice man. He married multiple times and blamed me when they ended. His children, my half-siblings, were also not very nice. They were cruel (slamming a door on my hand, among other things). When I was 11 he told me I wasn't his child and he sent me away to live with my aunt and uncle (his reasoning was that I was ruining his marriage, again). My aunt and uncle are wonderful people who raised me with a lot of love and I owe them everything. I have no contact with my birth mother. 

My half siblings have tried to contact me. John has too. But I never want to talk to them. They remind me of a very bad time in my life that I don't really want to think about.

Although the kittens had no tags, we weren't really looking to add a kitten to our house.

Fast forward 4 days, and we have talked to every neighbor we can find (as these are lake houses, many sit empty for weeks at a time between visits) and can't find an owner for the kittens. They are living outside, very hungry and very thirsty. So we've been feeding them and giving them water.

I had three biological kids, she doesn't have any but is undergoing IVF for her first.  She isn't asking our family to pay for it, she lives in a state where she has some insurance coverage so money isn't the issue here, it's more just ethics.

I told her that before she goes through with this she really needs to seriously consider adoption.  She blew up at me.  She said that almost every infertile person has considered adoption, and they don't need to be reminded.  She says she already looked into it, and although she doesn't care about passing on her specific genes, she wants more control over the child's health and custody, and doesn't want to deal with drug exposure in utero or biological relatives coming back into the picture.   (Edit: forgot to add she said that the only children legally free for adoption already that don't cost $50K are older or disabled and often traumatized.  I don't believe it.)

I feel like this is just not true.  There at tons of healthy baby orphans out there nobody wants...like millions...and I've never heard of any bio family coming back in to claim them.  It's also expensive but even with her insurance coverage I'm sure IVF is more expensive.  And there are literally orphans suffering all over the world while she NEEDS to create a new one?  I was just very upset to hear that she could be so selfish.

She told me I, of all people, have no place to judge because none of my children are adopted, they are all biological.  But I didn't need fertility treatments to have them.  I didn't need to adopt, but yes, I do think she needs to look into it.

She says she won't talk with me about this again until I adopt- and she specified that adopting an older child or disabled child are really the only ""free"" options that are unlikely to result in years of bio parental intervention and court cases, so if I adopt I better be open to that.

Her being stupid she opens it and reads it while in a lesson at school when her friends are around her. The rest of the class hear (because she's reading it out loud) and eventually the teacher catches on and goes to one of the heads of year because they're concerned (she actually texted me later saying the letter was sweet but she already knew my feelings for her and didn't need the letter). 

The school then starts an investigation and talk to the girl and she tells them about me asking her out and writing the songs (I think she told them about everything because we had a falling out a few days before). They decide that I've don't something really wrong. They make me go to see a doctor to talk about the situation (or else they'd bring someone in to talk to me). I get a day in insolation (in a room for the whole day in silence doing work) and the news spreads and people gossip about it for the next few months.

Basically, my friends all think this is creepy but I say I was just doing it out of true love and that they don't know what it feels like. Bare in mind I have come to kind of regret it now.

0,"WIBTA if I gave my nephew tuition money behind my brothers back? | So my nephew is in his first year of undergrad at Penn in Wharton’s business school.  He planned on working during the summers + part time during school and taking out some student loans to pay for his tuition.  Well school is taking up a lot more of his time than he anticipated and had to stop working part time so he can focus on studying.  His dad (my brother) is a single dad and can’t afford to help him with tuition.  My wife and I don’t have kids and treat my nephew as if he were our own.  We’ve spoken to my brother about the situation and told him we’d be more than happy to help him out with tuition.  We both have good jobs and can afford to do so. My nephew plans on going to grad school as well so we don’t want him drowning in student debt.  

My brother won’t even entertain the idea of us giving him money and said if he can’t afford it he should transfer to a cheaper school in state.  My nephew was seriously considering transferring at the end of the school year due to his tuition costs.  For my wife and I, transferring is not an option if the only reason is money.  My wife is a Wharton alum and knows what kind of doors open when you graduate from such a good school.

0,"AITA because I didn’t birth my husband | 



So it’s my first Mother’s Day. When my husband asked me what I wanted for Mother’s Day, I had said something simple like a potted orchid and a card. We live on a budget and are not ones for extravagance. He said ok I can do that. The place that has the orchid is right by our house I told him exactly where it was he came back from the store without it saying I couldn’t find it. I go to the store, find it and because they only had a few left, I buy it for myself. 

I had already gotten a gift for his mother a one of a kind piece of home decor and upon getting asked my husband do you think your mom would like this for Mother’s Day? He answered yes, I think she would like it. Yesterday his mom said she didn’t want anything to which I replied well we already got you something, she got very excited and I in turn matched her excitement, it felt good to bring her some joy. When we got off the phone he said let’s get her something for her instead of for the house and I said yea that sounds like a good idea. We look online for a present, a top stating her new status as a gma or jewellery. We end up settling on a door knocker. Today rolls around  and H says he found another one he felt she would like better it’s a bit more expensive. I say, that’s not a big deal It then dawns on me and  my next question was “I thought you didn’t want to get her something for the house?” 
He replied “Honestly I didn’t think she would like what you got her. Then you told her we got her something so now we have to.” 
“Well then why did you say she would like it if that wasn’t the case?”
“Because I didn’t want to hurt your feelings.”
“Well it hurts my feelings that you lied to me and that you’re doing all of this for your mother but haven’t done anything for me.” 
His response “Well she’s my mom and she birthed me, you didn’t. Besides you already bought yourself the orchid so there goes my gift idea.” 

That fucking sent me through the roof! 
My response “fine we won’t fucking celebrate Mother’s Day.”  After calming down I told him this hurt my feelings that it wasn’t about the gift, it’s the fact that he didn’t put any effort into anything like making breakfast or planning anything for the day. 
He replied I thought about making breakfast but we didn’t have anything in. 
I walked out of the room upset because we live near three grocery stores. 
Considering everything I have done for our family. The getting up with our child every night since birth while he sleeps because he works the next day, making sure the house is clean, dinners are made, clothes washed I felt that at least today would be a little bit special.

0,"AITA for not telling my SIL that I got a restraining order against my ex? | This happened about three years ago, but it still feels shitty, so I figured I'd ask for the internet's verdict.

I had moved from my home state to WA for a couple of years, and my only family out there was my brother, his wife, and his daughters. The daughters are college-age and a couple hours away and I didn't spend much time with them. My brother was also deployed at the time, which means that the only family I really had contact with was my SIL.

I started dating a guy and things got really bad after about two months. I broke up with him, but he just didn't understand how to take no for an answer. He started threatening me and harassing me on every forum he found me on. Things were bad enough that I got a restraining order.

Around the same time things took a nosedive with my ex, my SIL had a stroke. She has MS and has had them before. She texted me to let me know what happened, and throughout the next few weeks I kept checking up on her and asking if she needed anything or needed me to come over. She kept saying no, that she wanted to just have her space and have her daughter help her. That's totally not an issue at all, but my point is that I didn't see her during this time. 

Since I didn't see her and knew she was dealing with serious medical stuff, it didn't feel appropriate to just text her about the restraining order and breakup. So, I didn't tell her until about a month after it happened.

She lost her shit. She cussed me out and called me a selfish bitch for ""icing her out."" I apologized and explained why I didn't tell her. She didn't acknowledge my apology and just left after yelling at me. About six weeks later, I was incredibly sick. She brought me some medicine and asked if we were going to talk about what an asshole I was. I asked her if she really wanted to do this now, while I was practically naked and thinking of going to the hospital.

0,"AITA for being honest about my ex's mental health with my son? | Background:

I was married for 12 years to my ex. She's never been diagnosed with a mental illness, but only because she's always refused to talk to anyone about it, I asked/ pleaded, but no dice. She had a noticeable anxiety issue when I married her, but being young and dumb, I assumed my unconditional love would fix it. 

I was wrong, and her mental health gradually got worse over our marriage, especially after significant life events like a stillborn child. She self-medicated by getting more and more religious.

She'd always believed in homeschooling and our marriage ended because I realised that it was doing a disservice to our children and wanted them to at least try school - it ended because by that point, homeschooling had become a directive from God for her. 

Anyway, after the separation, she spiralled, to the point that I ended up with full custody of our five kids. I've had then fulltime for just over a year. They haven't seen her since as she left the country afterwards and so has never used her supervised access. 

Scenario:

In a wide ranging discussion with my two oldest boys (11 and 14), the separation came up and Master 11 said ""I'm glad you got full custody, Mum was cuckoo"", rather sneeringly.

I told him (after telling him not to talk about his Mum in that tone) ""Your Mum has mental health issues, but that's okay, nearly everyone will have a challenge like that in our lives, but the problem was your Mum didn't treat it. There's lots of support that help people with mental health issues to heal and live good lives""

I feel like TA because I felt like I was trash talking his Mum. I've done my absolute best to avoid that, and this felt like that. 

It felt like my only other option was to shut down the conversation, because trying to deny she has mental health issues wouldn't fly, my children have experienced her behaviour and formed their own opinions. 

And I was worried that he'll develop a poor attitude towards people with mental health challenges based on his Mum, so I wanted to explain that a) they're reasonably common and b) usually treatable.

0,"AITA - My mother has helped my husband and I financially countless times. I’ve recently got a job that pays $20k a month. She asked me to help her retire. I told her no. | My mother was mentally and physically abusive when I was a child. I even called the cops on her when I was 11, but they didn’t do anything despite my bruises. She would pull my hair and drag me by it. She would kick me in the stomach if I didn’t comply. Once she asked me to unlock a door and I dropped the keys whilst trying to hurry up before she got to the door, and she slapped me. Anytime my stepfather said anything it would result in an argument, “how dare you tell me how to raise my child”! I remember we had people over and I talked back to her like any young teenage girl would and she threw water at me in front of everyone. It was embarrassing. She always got me gifts though, like iPhones and expensive stuff. She always let my then highschool boyfriend (now husband) go with us on vacations, and paid for him. She was also really kind some days and really abusive another. I left her at 18. 

She was broken after I left. She cried a lot from what I heard from my grandmother. My stepfather got cancer and she needed someone. She was always trying to get in contact with me. I finally gave in after 2 years of ignoring her calls. She seemed to have changed. A very religious mother, was able to accept me as an atheist. She also had a child with my stepfather and I noticed she never hurts him at all (thank goodness). She never spanks him. She let’s him do anything he wants. She’s so lenient that my little brother has become kind of a dick. My point is that she really has changed. 

During difficult financial spots last year she’s helped loan thousands of dollars to my husband and I. My husband and I have paid her back everything she’s ever loaned us when we needed help. We also paid for her iphone and her phone bill because she usually takes us out on vacations (Disneyland, Vegas, New York, Texas, I could go on). She likes spending time with family and she makes good money at 90k a year. 

I’m 23, and I’ve recently (6 months ago) got a job that’s been paying me about $20k+ a month. I’m very lucky for this job and opportunity. My mother and I have been in a mostly good relationship since we started talking again despite a few quarrels here and there. We fight over things like her being a dick to service people. 

Sorry if this is getting long. I figured her story is important. My stepfather died this year to cancer, and she’s now raising my little brother (6 years old) alone. My father also died when I was small, and she had to raise me alone. My mother currently lives in the ghetto with her son. She’s in debt due to all the medical bills from his cancer. She has a home but is renting it to someone and it’s in another state since she’s travel nursing (for a year now). She stopped working for a year to help my stepfather with his cancer. He died shortly after their 10 year anniversary. It was really heartbreaking.

The problem is she saw how much we made and immediately started crying “happy tears” talking about how now she can retire. She’s 45. She saw the money and immediately wanted something for Christmas, I told her yeah we’ll get you something but we can’t buy you diamonds yet (she loves diamonds). She said “yes you can”. She wants to retire in another country (my home country) for $500 a month “or sometimes more” she said winking. She has a paid off condo there so the $500 a month would be for her and my little brother to live off of. I agreed to her terms because she was literally crying happy tears in front of me. I figured it’s not that much money to help someone’s who’s lost her husband to cancer. She’s been through a lot. She was a prostitute in my home country and later married an abusive American man and dealt with it to give me a better life. 

But I couldn’t sleep at night, I was thinking why should I help her retire if she abused me mentally and physically as a child? My husband told me, she’s helped us with a lot, but it’s up to you. I called her back two days later after I told her I’d help her retire. I told her I’m not going to help you, I just can’t. I tried to explain why but anytime I talk about anything “bad” that happened between us she gets angry and tells me to stop talking now. (Great for closure on my childhood btw /s) She has anxiety problems. I also told her I’d help her anytime she needed food, or just needed anything. I just couldn’t do the $500 every month. She freaked out and told me to BE QUIET and not to explain myself. She hung up. Now... I feel like a complete asshole. I could definitely afford that. I’m living it up with my husband. I have a great life. I’m able to pay off my medical, student, and credit card debts. She’s struggling with a ton of medical debts. She’s struggled all her life. I could help not only my mother, but also my brother. She wants to homeschool him because he doesn’t want to go to school. She said if I helped her retire she would be able to spend her time teaching him and they could live a nice happy life. 

I’d like you to give it to me straight. AITA? 

TLDR; I’ve recently started making a lot of money. My mother who was abusive when I was a child has turned her life around. She takes my husband and I on vacations and has loaned us money (which we paid back). She wants to retire in my home country for $500 a month.

About him: he's self employed so his hours can vary, but the earliest he usually works is 9am. When he's not working early in the morning he will often stay up late watching TV/YouTube/gaming until he passes out.

The problem: this happens probably 2-3 times a week. He will pass out on the couch while watching TV, then once he wakes up (anywhere from 2-6am) he will come to bed. That's not the bad part. The bad part is like what happened this morning.

He came to bed around 4:30. Of course this woke the dog up who came over to give him kisses. Then he starts *talking to the dog like I'm not right there beside him trying to sleep!* eventually he rolls over and goes to sleep too.

Then it gets worse. If I don't wake up when he comes to bed, I will when he starts snoring, which is always about 1.5-2 hours after coming to bed sometimes I will have *just* drifted off after being woken when he came to bed only to be woken again by his snoring.

I became good friends with all of the hostesses except one, we'll call her Patty.

Patty is rude, mean, snotty and condescending. She treats everything like a competition and you can't have a conversation without her making it about herself. All around unpleasant person.

Then my roommate gets a girlfriend(V) whom my boyfriend does not like from the beginning and she and I are ok for a while. However we get into an argument because she says she’s going to get a cat (I am highly allergic and my bf hates cats) and I told her she can’t just get a cat without asking us first and we will say no. Plus my dog will likely kill or injure it. She loses her shit and screams at us saying she can do whatever she wants because it’s her house too. (She punched holes in the wall which I didn’t find out until much later) Eventually Matt talks her down and that was that but I distanced myself from her a lot since then. 

We all end up moving in with a friend (Joe) into a 3 bedroom apt because rent would be a steal. Things are great, but V and I are alone one day and she tells me, “I’ve only wanted to really physically hurt you once, when we had the fight about the cat.

She isn't capable of being on her own but my wife and I both have full time jobs and one facet of my employment is unpredictability. I could be here tommorow and on the other side of the country the next day. This would leave my wife alone for unknown amounts of time until I return. Even tho she is tough I feel like this could eventually impact our marriage. I truly believe that a special care home would be best but she doesn't want to go. She has been deemed to have pretty substantial dementia along with major lung problems. Honestly the worst part is the way she treats my wife. My grandmother is ""old school"". I have seen it first hand where she will order my wife to do stuff for her but doesn't want to ""bother me with such things"". She is concerned that I am tired from my job.

1,"AITA for sending my son to live at his grandfathers? | My first wife died when my oldest son was 3 and my youngest was only 9 months old. I remarried when they were 8 and 5 and then had another son with my Second Wife (SW) when they were 10 and 7. My first two boys never fully got along with my SW, but they did learn to get better as they got older, even though the older one never fully got along with her.

To put things lightly they fought a lot. There was usually a blowout once every month or two and they could never see eye to eye. A good portion of the fights were caused when my oldest would call her on anything he felt was unfair, especially in the treatment of my youngest to the older two. The youngest definitely did get preferential treatment, but that's what you'd expect from someone caring for their actual child as apposed to kids that came with me as a package deal. 

They both went to therapy separately to try and work things out when my oldest was 14 and he told me his therapist told him to stop engaging her as they saw no other alternative. SW didn't like that and threatened to divorce me but she also hadn't worked since my youngest was born so she wouldn't have any source of income meaning she'd take my money, youngest son, and consequently my house away if that were to happen. We wen't to therapy together and worked many of our issues out but the issue with her and my oldest still stood.

I got them to go to therapy together after that and it only lasted one session because she spent the entire hour telling the therapist all the nasty things she felt about him. He didn't talk to me much after that and I found the whole situation very hard because I didn't want to choose sides to make it look like I favoured one or the other. That was the case for most of the arguments between them, where I just didn't know what to do and I didn't want to pick sides. My relationship with my oldest became more and more distant after that but things started to turn around when he went to university.

He came back however, and fought with his younger brother (16 at the time) and they didn't speak for a month. He then went to work at a summer camp he'd been working at for 4 years and called me a month and a half in saying he wanted to go home because he wasn't happy with how the new leadership was treating the staff that year. He was fighting with his step mom, now his brother, and his camp too. I couldn't handle it so I sent him to live with his grandfather and he hasn't talked to me since.

It's been 2 years and he still hasn't spoken to me and I'm starting to wonder if my decision to have him elsewhere was wrong. I couldn't handle the fighting but he called me asking to come home. He was fighting for better working conditions and he was an essential team member to that camp so I know his heart was in the right place even if he was fighting once again. I just couldn't risk the strain on my family that his anger was causing. So with that, AITA for sending my son to live with his grandfather?",False,False,4,3,2,3,1,2,Care

0,"AITA for ""favoring"" one stranger's kid over the other? | I do 2nd hand doll rehab/repair.

I took a bus from my home state to Philly\* to pick up a doll lot a friend had collected for me. With me, I had a Disney Animator Belle that I’d refashioned into Megara from Hercules; the hair, the dress, the sandals; all by me.

I had a few other outfits on hand, the clothes fit any girl Animator. My friend is a collector, and I’m a doll rehabber, lol, so I figured she might want Meg as a thank you. She declined.

At the bus station, a guy helped me haul the suitcase out of the trunk of my Uber, we joked about how heavy doll bodies could be. On the bus, I got lucky that I had two seats to myself. A mom and her daughter, maybe eight or nine, sit across from me. The kid across the aisle from me, Emma, borrows a notebook, shares my food, borrows my hoodie when she’s cold—her mom said it was fine when I checked with her before handing anything over.

About an hour in, Emma reaches over and picks up my sketch book. I take it back, tell her that’s not polite, and put it in my bag. A little bit later she reaches over, *into my bag*, and takes my tablet. I take it back, tell her it’s not a good habit to help yourself to other people’s things, and put it away. This time the bag goes to my other side in the window seat. She pouts, but that’s the end of it. Next stop, she asks to borrow my tablet and settles into watching a movie. I got out with everyone else and notice the guy that had helped me with my suitcase is sitting on a bench with his daughter, doing a birthday cupcake with a candle from the mini-mart. I overhear that her name is Selena and she’s five.

So I hop back on the bus, grab Meg and her accessories out of my carry-on, write a quick *Happy Birthday Selena* on a slip of paper, and left Meg sitting on her seat. I ducked back out, snagged her Dad to let him know it was me, and go about my business.

When I get back on the bus, Selena is sobbing, Meg in her arms like she’d been handed the Hope diamond. I faked the surprised reaction, blending in with everyone else on the bus that’s trying to console her, but she’s just so happy- it was a moment. Nobody outed me, praise the Fates.

At our last stop, as we’re all getting off the bus, Emma’s mom pulled me aside and said it was really shitty of me to give Selena the doll when her daughter was sitting right next to me the whole time. Emma had shown zero interest in the doll when it was sitting next to me in my bag; she’d never asked about it.

I snapped at her about how I could calculate the cost of letting her kid use my tablet, fed her, loaned her my clothing, paid attention to her and played babysitter the entire bus ride while you slept on the window--and it still wouldn’t cover the cost of the hair alone. I told her to back the fuck up and mind her own business, who I give or sell my dolls to is at my discretion.",False,False,4,3,2,2,1,3,Care
0,"AITA for staying in touch with, and giving money to, the daughter my mom gave up for adoption? | So, my mom got pregnant when she was 20 and gave the baby up for adoption. Years later she met my dad, got married and had me. 

The daughter she gave up, I’ll call her Sarah, is now 35. About 6 months ago Sarah reached out to my mom and they got to meet and talk for the first time. After that, Sarah was invited a couple times over for dinner to meet us; I liked her, but I think by the third dinner my mom had definitely changed her opinion of Sarah, and it showed. 

I will add my mom lacks certain maternal instincts; she will always care deeply about status and appearance, more than anyone I’ve met, which we’ve always butted heads over. 

Sarah is a waitress, a chain smoker, dresses a bit sloppy, and just generally wouldn’t fit in with my mother’s standards or her world. She also had a previous drug arrest when younger, for cocaine, which she told us about on the third dinner.

After that dinner, my mom said we should probably stop meeting with her and literally called her a “disappointment.” My dad was also surprised but just leaves the decision up to her. I didn’t say much but before this, Sarah and I had already followed each other on Instagram and exchanged numbers. We texted maybe once every couple weeks, just talking about random stuff. I think she got the hint my mom didn’t want her around anymore but we really didn’t address it. I feel bad for her, I can only imagine it would be hard to finally connect with your biological mom and be let down like that. 

Anyways, with everything happening recently, she lost her job. I saw her post about this and wanted to help, so I sent her $400. I have a decent job and have a good amount saved, so I felt like I could afford to, and she is my biological sister after all. Maybe part of it was guilt over how shitty my mom was. 

My mom found out about this and got very upset. She said I had no right to keep in contact with Sarah let alone be sending her money, that really it wasn’t my business to do this, and that it was very disrespectful to her. 

I didn’t think she’d be this upset over it and I have no experience with this kind of situation. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong but I’m curious what others think. 

TLDR: my mom gave up a baby girl, Sarah, before she had me. They reconnected and as my mom is obsessed with status and appearance, she was “disappointed” with Sarah (a chainsmoking waitress with a previous drug arrest). My mom didn’t want us to see her anymore. I kept in touch with Sarah and even sent her $400 recently when she lost her job.

0,"AITA for treating some of my niblings differently because of their parents? | I'm probably a bit older than most people on this forum. I have a brownstone in a very expensive city. I own it, so I don't have a mortgage to think about. I'd have to estimate that even a shared bedroom arrangement would be about $600 a month with utilities, and anything with a private bedroom could easily be $1000+ a month. 

My brother's children wanted to live with me for college, and have spent months with me before or since. I've always had an open door policy for them with very few rules. I've never been interested in charging them rent, as I don't need it. I only asked that they chip in a little on food utilities. Between housing allowances from scholarships, my brother throwing in cash/gift card gifts, and occasional money from the kids, if I had to calculate it, I usually ended up getting about $200 a month from them. Like I said, I don't care. We never had any issues and they're good kids.

Some of my cousins' kids are getting to that age, and are asking to come live with me. I'm not comfortable with this, for one main reason: I absolutely HATE their parents. My cousins have always looked down on me, and it came to a head when my children passed. I am not a normal childless woman. I had two kids, but they died in childhood of unnatural causes (my ex-husband). My cousins pretty much blamed me and my ""poor choices"" for it, and it helped send me into a depression that lasted for years. I still see them on some holidays for some elderly aunts and uncles, but that level of hatred is never forgotten. 

I know that this isn't the kids' fault, but I can't stomach the idea of having to see my cousins more, and it feels icky to have younger versions of those people running around my house. One of them is looks exactly like the cousin who said the worst things, and is the exact age.

Baby comes, dad sticks it out for a while then moves back home to Ohio (were in PA). Sister does the whole single mom thing for a bit, but meets a guy and decides she’d rather go out and party every night with him then spend time home with a kid so she gives full custody of my nephew to his dad around his second birthday. (Luckily dad stepped up and my nephew is a happy healthy adorable 10 year old).

Cut to 2 years ago and my sister announces she’s pregnant. She tells everyone how happy she is and how she can’t wait to be “a real mom” and that this is going to be her “second chance” baby. 

The baby is born and for a while she seems to be doing well, she was working hard and focused on raising her son. Now he’s 2, and a bit of a handful (as all toddlers are) and her temper with him has been getting shorter and shorter. She constantly snaps at him or will come home from work and put him right to bed so that she doesn’t have to deal with him. She also has started seeing someone. This guy lives in Pittsburgh (nowhere near where we live) and she has been driving out to see him more and more often. When she goes out there she leaves my nephew at his babysitters for days at a time without telling anyone where he is until after the fact. 

I think it’s incredibly dangerous for her to be leaving him with someone who doesn’t have any of our contact information and no one in my family even knows her name let alone how to get ahold of her in case of an emergency. We’ve all said something to her but of course she just rolls her eyes and ignores everyone.

She just got back from a 4 day trip to Pittsburgh where my nephew spent the whole time at his babysitters (unbeknownst to us- she swore he was with her until she got home an hour ago and admitted he was at the sitters) and then texted me and my sister about plans for her birthday next weekend where she intends to send the baby to the sitter for another 3 days.

That being said, it really took a toll in how she raised me. She always talked about my brother, compared me to him, etc. I always felt like I lived in his shadow and that has been hard. I know she doesn’t meant to do this and I have tried talking to her about it, but she says it’s not intentional, so all I can do is get therapy for myself on the subject.

I don’t mind talking about my brother or even when my mom does. The main issue lies in that she’ll bring him up at times that aren’t the best. She will talk about it at holidays or family gatherings, starting to cry and really bring down the mood. Someone will always have to come comfort her, as she talks about how he should be there. And again, I do feel for her. She’s been in and out of therapy for years about this and I know it’s hard.

It only got worse as I got older and started going through the milestones.

It didn’t ruin my wedding, but it was sad after that for a while. Similar things happened when I graduated from both high school and college.

She added that she wished that my brother had been as blessed as me to have kids. The post then stopped being about my daughter and turned into prayers and well wishes to my mom.

Ok, so this needs some back story. I'm a 25 F and my daughter is 3 months old. I have a 16 sister I'll call Tina, we also had a brother between Tina and I. My brother died when he was young and my mom took it hard. After his death my mom was very distant from me, I was basically raised by my Grandparents (dad was work two jobs or long hours at one). Then Tina was born around the time I was 10 years old, from then on I was basically a live in babysitter for Tina. 

Over the years Tina grow to treat me like her mother because I took care of her, made sure she was fed, did the grocery shopping and tired to keep the house clean. Rarely I would go out with friends, my mom would tell at me about: not going out with friends, about going out too much with friends( after yelling at me for not going out), that I was lazy, that she should send me to a girl's home ( this happened whenever I disagreed with her or did something like not do the dishes which I did almost everyday after cooking dinner), slapping me if she didn't like my answer to her question (example: where is the remote?  Me answering: I don't know), etc. 

Now I live with my loving husband and daughter, and have a tentative relationship with her because of my sister and dad. My mother in law is very loving and knows to not push me because of my mom, but she and I had a talk we're she told me that after spending time with my mom and having her talk about my brother more then either Tina, me or my daughter (they were shopping for my daughter) and her spending the whole time I was in labour talking about her birthing my brother. Or the time we're she told her about how she's to thank for me knowing how to care for my daughter because she made me care for Tina.

0,"AITA for making sugar free food for my diabetic coworker? | (On mobile so I'm sorry if formatting is weird) 

Okay back story: I recently started a new job at a childcare center as the ""kitchen manager""- making breakfast, lunch, snacks, doing prep, dishes, etc. Basically all the kitchen work. I love to cook and bake anyway and this is my first time getting to work in a job that allows me to do that. I've been making things like coffee cake and banana bread and muffins at home on my own time specifically for the staff to munch on throughout the day because everyone has been really welcoming and feeding people is how I show affection. 

Here's the thing-there's a couple staff members with dietary restrictions. One woman has a soy allergy. One has an egg and nut allergy. One is very diabetic. So I've been modifying all my recipes to accommodate them. Today, I was talking to my boss and telling her about the banana bread I brought in this morning-how I had replaced the eggs and sugar without sacrificing the flavor. The woman with diabetes, ""Ann"", must have been right outside the kitchen when I was talking about how I had replaced the sugar and she LOST. HER. SHIT. She started yelling that I must have invaded her privacy to find out she was diabetic and that making things sugar free without talking to her was me ""policing her body"". Flabbergasted, I tried to explain that, as the person making all the food, I have to know *everyone's* food restrictions, both kids and staff. She then called the other 2 staff with food restrictions in to ""expose"" what I had done. The other 2 women said they were already aware that I knew about their restrictions and were grateful that I went out of my way to accommodate them. Ann continued ranting about me policing her and said I was ""shaming"" her. I hate confrontation and when I'm being yelled at, I implode and start crying. My boss was standing right there the whole time trying to help me explain to Ann and, when I started crying, she told Ann to stop screaming and take the rest of the day off. Ann left, but she was messaging and texting the rest of the staff about how horrible I had made her feel. Now the staff is divided-about half think I did nothing wrong and the other half think I should have talked to her and asked if she wanted me to make things sugar free because she's very sensitive about her diabetes being primarily caused by her weight. They also think it's my fault she got sent home, that I was ""overdramaric"" and ""trying to make Ann look bad"" by crying and that I'm an ass because being sent home will be a strike in her file.

She also laughs when other people laugh. Not out of social obligation like a polite chuckle but like a full on laugh and sometimes she can’t stop even when it wasn’t that funny and others have stopped.

She will sometimes eat cookies late at night, a lot of carbs, and “not paleo” things.  I’ll be clear, we both eat healthily, I just eat a stricter diet.

This morning I commented on her choice of a breakfast sandwich (bacon, eggs, ciabatta, mayonnaise) and said she should not be combining a lot of fat with a lot of carbs, also stating that it’s ok to eat one or the other, just not a lot of both. She starts crying and claims that she feels judged for her food choices and that she hadn’t had a sandwich in a long time and woke up craving one. She says I made her feel shitty and judged.

0,"AITA for breaking up with my ex for being more into Asian culture than me? (I'm Asian) | fyi, this happened a couple years ago

i'm chinese and korean, but i'm adopted by white people so i didn't grow up with the culture. later on into my teens i developed more of an interest in it. i used to date this guy (i was 19 at the time, he was 22) that was really into asian culture, and he was quite knowledgable about them. he was even learning japanese and korean.

at first, i thought it was cool, we seemed to have a lot of interests in common, which was rare for me since the town i grew up in is more rural and predominantly white.

later on in our relationship, he would tease me about not knowing any korean and being a ""bad asian"" and would basically try to flex on me by speaking japanese and korean (not very well, but he was still just learning) and showing off his knowledge. this annoyed me, because it wasn't my fault i wasn't brought up in those cultures, and due to teasing, i was pretty ashamed of them as a kid. also, i'm not japanese so i don't even know why he would bring that into our conversations so constantly. i like a few animes, but he was the one who was clearly more into them than me.

at one point, he teased me in front of my parents and said something like ""i'm basically more asian than your daughter is, isn't that funny?"" and they laughed along but i wasn't very amused. i didn't confront him there, but i told him later that those jokes were getting old. he argued that he was just encouraging me to learn more about my culture and he would teach me, but that struck a nerve i guess and i broke up with him there (we had been dating for a few months). in that moment, his interest in asian culture was less impressive/cool to me than it was obnoxious and a bit creepy. he said i was ""fucked up"" for making him feel bad about his interests. 

i'll admit he did know a lot about asian pop culture, but it mostly centered around his initial interest in japanese culture. so i'd say his interest was maybe a bit more shallow whereas i actually am chinese/korean, and i was more interested in learning about my own culture. i never had a problem with his interests, just him teasing me for not being asian ""enough.""

Surprisingly she obliged easily and this was the routine for a couple weeks. I thought her phase was over as she would eat everything without a hassle.

The doctor said that she had lost a bit of weight but it wasn’t threatening at the moment but she would need it managed and check regularly. She had a therapist appointment 2-3 times a week. Not much came of it and after about a month she was thinner and weaker. It was horrible, I just wanted to help her.

Every morning she would make a smoothie, like with stuff like berries and vegetables in an attempted to be ‘healthy’ So I decided to order 5 kg of weight gain formula that’s used for muscle growth. Every morning I would make her these ‘healthy smoothies’, and she never questioned it. 

The doctor was pleased by her weight gain, I had told him about the formula he said it was fine as it was helping and keeping her from a risk bmi. Everything was going great. Thankfully she was making process with the therapist and each day she was improving more, during this time she was rarely able to do cheer which motivated her get healthy.
