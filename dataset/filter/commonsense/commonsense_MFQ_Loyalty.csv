0,"AITA for being angry w my parents for losing my national insurance number | so this is a bit of a long story so buckle up. 

in scotland you are given a national insurance number when you turn sixteen, when mine arrived in the mail my parents told me they would keep it safe and one day when i needed it to apply for a job (which they had been pressuring me about) they revealed that they had lost it. naturally i got upset and told my parents that i was really annoyed with them. 

we’ve been having a strained relationship lately and this was just the tip of the iceberg as i’ve been feeling really unwanted because my mum seems to want to spend more time with my younger sister than myself even getting to the point of showing joy when my sister agrees to hang out with her compared to when i do she tries to get out of it.

idk it’s a lot of deep family issues that my parents have never addressed with me which i feel makes it all worse at the end of the day. 

so today when i was applying for uni i saw that i need a national insurance number to do so and since my parents also lost my birth certificate i have to wait a month to get one as i need to have a birth certificate to apply for a NI number. 

this has really stressed me out because i know my parents will procrastinate so i’m scared that i won’t be able to apply for uni which is my worst fear. when i brought that up to my mum she brushed it off and said ‘it wasn’t her responsibility’ for both the loss of the NI and the birth certificate which ended in another argument which became vicious with some name calling. 

in my mind i blame my mum because she was meant to look after these documents but AITA for blaming her?",False,False,3,4,5,2,1,3,Loyalty
1,"AITA For joining a ""dating"" discord to meet friends when i have a boyfriend? | My online long distance boyfriend of over 1,3 years recently found out that i have been in a ""dating"" discord for a while now. I joined said discord only to make friends however. 

The server in particular has roles to give a short introduction to who you are, for example: age, length, continent of origin, gender, etc. One of them being relationship status. Mine has always been set to ""taken"". I frequently talk in there and even made a few friends. Which is quite special for me. I dont have any irl friends because im mute, meaning i cant talk at all, since my vocal cords dont work. Dealing with this my entire life was hard, i was always bullied for it. But 1,3 years ago my life really turned around. I met him playing Rainbow 6 siege. We talked and talked... Eventually we found ourselves in love... It was magical, i had never felt like this. I finally felt like someone loved me for who i was.

Lets get back on track. I joined this discord to interact with people, not to date. I never thought about cheating on him, and i never will. I sent him a gif from the server, nothing weird, just a cute anime girl being poked, it had the server name on it and he looked it up. When he found out he freaked out a lot. He said he was vomiting and crying. I thought he was overreacting, but im pretty sure he was serious. I sincerely apologized. Acknowledged his feelings, and talked to him about it. He still feels awful. As if he'd been betrayed. I explained to him many times i had not cheated on him at all, and that i just wanted to socialize, but he's still very much upset. So...

0,"AITA My friend asked me to be her bridesman, but I bailed during the bridal shower and bachelorette party because I felt uncomfortable. | So last year, one of my best friends got engaged. We have been close for years as best friends and I was thrilled for her. I did not know her fiance, but she wanted me at her wedding and asked if I would be one of her bridesmaids, or a bridesman if you will. I got a chuckle out of the idea, but I really wanted to be there for her more than anything because friends support friends. I also live in a different city and state, and I wanted to see someone whom I do not see often. So I said yes.

I am the only man in the group and did not know the other women before. I still do not know everyone. But I went to the bridal shower this past weekend, and I felt very uncomfortable. This was my very first one, too, and did not have any idea of what I was getting into. I am shy and don't always take to people immediately, but I thought the people there were not terribly friendly. I also forgot a gift (I am an asshole there no doubt). 

The first game was seeing who had the most unique items in their purse. That was followed by games such as who knew the most about the soon-to-be-bride and guessing if the groom or the bride did ""these things first"". I was the only man there and just felt very out of place. I learned that the bachelorette party was changing, and was going to involve a sleepover. 

I felt so uncomfortable that I faked a sudden family event and left the party as the bridal party was getting ready to party. I didn't want to tell my friend/bride that I was uncomfortable and lied.

We joke about person A's relationship between this girl because this girl is really weird to person A (like she would slap his ass and just casually put her legs on person A, even though he isn't comfortable with it), and I don't really know if he takes it personally but it doesn't really look like it because he just agrees with us and says that girl is weird. Now the inside joke on me is that the only sport I play is piano. I know this isn't true and I do play some sports, but this hits really close to me because growing up I was always thought of as the nerd who only studied and played video games, but for the past year I've really tried to improve my physical side. I joined this weekly run club, started doing a bodyweight workout regime (pushups, dips, pullups) and really grinded in basketball (which I'm still not even good at), but the thing is, I tried really hard and I'm still insecure about my physical side.

0,"AITA for asking my twin sister for asking why she never wished me a happy birthday, a week after our actual birthday? | So on Monday, February 25, my twin sister and I turned 20 years old. 

We are both in college, although she lives on campus at hers, which is about two hours away. I commute to my school because it’s only fifteen minutes from home. We always _at least_ text each other a “happy birthday” each year. 

This year, I went around the house collecting some baby pictures of her and I (and two of them included our older brother). I then made a collage of them and made a post to her on Facebook to wish her a happy birthday. 


 So this passed Monday, around 11 PM I was just scrolling through my texts to clear up space on my phone and saw she hadn’t texted me in awhile. Then I saw it was the same on Facebook and such. My heart just kind of... broke. I don’t know. I know this all sounds very petty, but it did. So I texted her saying, “So like you never wished me happy birthday... what’s that all about?”

Her response was this: “? I could ask the same of you??”

I’ll show the rest of the conversation, her replies will be marked by the letter “H”. 

Me: “I did. I sent you a whole collage and then sent you a Jake [one of our dogs]pic on messenger. I went around the house for baby pics cuz 20 is the end of teens and all you know?”

H: “I just happen to have randomly woken up rn but I don’t know why you’re up right now and I feel like you just want to start a fight or create a problem so I’m going back to sleep as should you and you have found something to be angry about that you had a week to mention.”

Me: “I’m not angry and I can see why it can be misinterpreted as angry cuz I was just sending multiple texts but the multiple texts was to clarify when I had said happy birthday. And when I asked about why you didn’t say it it’s cuz I just felt weird about it that’s all.”

H: “I don’t necessarily think you’re angry I just think that you have made something an issue just to have an issue because it’s late and the issue doesn’t really exist and you’re just making up a reason to be resentful.”

Me: “It’s just hurtful I guess. It just showed I wasn’t on your mind enough to text a quick “hbd” at the very least is all I’m trying to say.”

Her: “If it is so hurtful I don’t understand why you are mentioning it a week later that seems unfair.”

Me: “ I’m mentioning it a week later because I was hoping you would still end up sending something out eventually. But yeah sorry for being unfair I guess and it is late, I’ll go to bed.”

1,"AITA for setting a 30 day sit-up challenge with my gf? | For context, my gf is slightly insecure about her stomach. It's really baffling to me since 1) she's so pretty 2) there is literally no stomach and to me, I do not understand why she feels this way, but given that she is, I wanted to start a 30 day sit-up challenge with her so we can both tackle this head-on and hopefully fix this dumb insecurity she has. When i mentioned it to her - it was presented from a good place, i know girls get weird about these kind of things but I'm the kind of person where if someone has a problem - especially something that can easily be taken care of, I will do my best to urge and motivate that person to get over it. I also go to the gym fairly often and had some exercise sessions already planned. I thought this would have been a moment that we could share and overcome together as a couple together, so I suggested the idea but she took it offensively. I was kinda bummed cause i really just want to help her overcome this but that was that and nothing else was confirmed about this challenge. Well this weekend i spent the night and saw her yoga mat on the floor and asked why was it there and she mentioned she had started the challenge. I was honestly surprised because she turned me down and never communicated anything to me but was happy she was up for the challenge. This morning we woke up and I said I would start the challenge with her today and began doing them once she said she'll do them after me. Well for whatever reason, she didn't want to do them with me - so now im confused and ask why and she basically went back and started an argument over the initial ask and how rude I was for even suggesting this to her since I was basically calling her fat (she prob weighs 125 in wet clothes).

0,"AITA for ending my friendship because my best friend was a bridezilla? | So my best friend (22f) was in an on-off relationship for several years. I never really liked her then boyfriend, and never really supported the relationship. The guy can't hold a job, and there were many times that she had to have 2 jobs to pay his portion of the bills. Then they broke up and she chased after some other guy, and when he ghosted her, she was suddenly engaged to first guy and gave 3 months to plan the wedding. I was her MOH, and I live a few states away from her. So I kept my opinion of the wedding to myself. I offered to buy all the wedding favors, decorations, etc and she turned down every offer. 

We got into several arguments because she said I wasn't helping like I should be, but being several states away, there was only so much I could do except for offer to help financially. And it honestly pissed me off that I was doing everything I possibly could and she still wasn't happy. 

Fast forward, I go down for the wedding with my then 11 month old. Keep in mind that I drove 8 hours without my husband, with an 11 month old, for this wedding. I stayed in town for a week so that I could do all the bridesmaids events. I was staying with my parents, who still had to work. She was upset that I was bringing my son to everything, but then was upset if i said i couldn't do something because i had my kid. She genuinely was mad that my family wasn't available to watch him so it really felt like a lose lose for me. 

Bachelorette party rolls around, we were all pretty trashed. She thought I was passed out drunk and started trash talking my husband. That was kinda the final straw for me. I have never trashed her now husband to anyone. He doesn't abuse her, doesn't call her names, so therefor it isn't my place to say what I think. So I was extremely upset. And the whole party her friend was asking me weird questions that you just dont ask in everyday conversation. The questions made it very obvious that she had been talking about me.

I go to the wedding, give my MOH speech, and stayed the entire reception, where my kid wasn't allowed (kid free reception) but she wanted him to be a ring bearer (which is why i brought him out of town with me). That whole trip was hell on me physically and financially. So after all was said and done I decided to just quietly distance myself from her because I was so upset at how I had been treated for those 3 months. 

She sent me a message asking why I've been so quiet and I told her that I thought she treated me really poorly and her saying that it was HER wedding was not an excuse to treat her best friend that way. Basically it blew up, she started trashing me on facebook so now i have her blocked everywhere.

I don’t know why but it’s always been this way, she’s always hated my mom too. Again idk why she’s this way but she is. She always has some drama with a different family member and has kept my cousins away from all of us, growing up. 


Every holiday or special day in our lives, have been basically celebrated separately because she causes huge fights between us all and she’s just a negative vibe in general.

We always talked about our family issues very openly and between us we always gave some sort of insight to each other. Still, I never dared to say something directly his family and I always thought he would never do something like this either. 

We went to dinner yesterday at my parents and my younger brother arrived almost at the end of it. My brother and my parents are having issues so this turned into a huge argument. I had already told my boyfriend about what was going on before and he decided to get in the middle of the argument. 

This set off my brother even more and he told my boyfriend that it was not his place to say anything because the issue did not concern him or me. It was between him and our parents and regardless of what I told my boyfriend he still knew nothing about it to speak so freely. At this point I was completely mortified because I could see that my parents were not pleased either. I ended up saying that I wanted to go home and so we did. 

During the car ride my boyfriend asked why I didn't say anything. I told him that my brother was right, it wasn't even my place to say something, much less his place to get into an argument like this. He then said that if it was his family and I he would have said something since he would like me to speak my mind. I told him that I would never do something like this because it was inappropriate and at the end of the day it had nothing to do with us. He tried to argue that the moment my brother said something to him it became an issue with us but I told him he only got what he deserved for inserting himself into something that he should never had.

At the time they had not decided what the field trip was or where we were going. Eventually the high schoolers chose to go to six flags which was around a 2.5 hour drive each way. 

Little bit of context. Six Flags is my gf and my favorite date place. I was afraid she was going to be upset if she knew I was going six flags she would get FOMO or just be jealous and upset that I was going without her. So I had told her that I was going to chaperone students but never said where exactly. I know she is a really smart girl so I removed my snapchat location so she would not see where I was at. This was the deal breaker. She got very upset and refused to talk to me the rest of the day. 

Naturally I was upset the entire time since she wasn't there and that she was mad at me. I just felt horrible, but thought she was going to be less upset if I didn't share where I was. Eventually late at night when we got home I finally told her where I went. She was just upset about the entire thing and said something around the lines of Never being able to trust me again.

My sister (who’s going to be a bridesmaid) found out and asked me if we could reschedule the party for noonish. I asked her why and she said it’s because she doesn’t feel safe going into that part of the city at night, because that’s statistically where the most assaults on women happen.

I told her I can call one of my fiancé’s best friends who lived near her to pick her up and drive her over so she can go with him and his wife, and then I’ll personally drive her home after. But she said no, because she just doesn’t want to be in the city fullstop at night. She says dark alleys and alcohol and strange men make her anxious and there will be some combination of that at my party. I basically shrugged to this and said, fine, you can not come if you want but there’s 56 people coming already. I can’t change plans just for you.

So. I’m 14.  We (me mom and brother) technically are the original owners of our dog.  He was my dads dog, my dad adopted him from the shelter about six years ago as a puppy. My dad tragically died two years ago.  When he died, he had a roommate/close friend who was really really attached to my dog.  She had been living  with my dad for a year up until he died. At the time my mom couldn’t keep my dog at her house because of her landlord, so my dads roommate kept the dog.  After a few months we tried to get him back after our landlord let us to have pets but the roommate REFUSED to give him back and had apparently register the dog in her name and took him to the vet and stuff and said he’s her dog now. We were all very upset because this dog is the last piece of my dad I have left. My mom called the police and told them the roommate technically stole our dog and they threatened to arrest her.  The roommate eventually gave in after fighting us for WEEKS because she decided she didn’t want to take us to court because she felt bad for us (my mom doesn’t have a lot of money and like come on my dad just effing died...) and so she gave us the dog back with all of his paperwork and everything.

It’s been two years now and we’re moving and my mom just told us we can’t keep the dog.  I’m devastated.

1,"AITA for refusing to go to my sister's wedding? | Am I (28M) the asshole for not wanting to go to my sister's (24F) wedding and ending a friendship with my best friend (29M)? 

So here's some backstory: Me and my best friend have been friends since middle school. We were like brothers and we used to hang out every day. He's a good guy but I recently found out he has been dating my younger sister behind my back. I didn't know until now. It was only when my sister announced they were going to get married I knew what was going on. Apparently, they have been dating for many years and engaged for 14 months without telling anyone.

Fast forward to today, and my sister announces she's going to get married and the wedding is next week. She invited her whole family to the wedding. I thought maybe she had been secretly dating someone maybe that's why she suddenly is going to get married. And maybe she hid it from me as she knew I would disapprove as I'm overprotective? My sister is the type of girl every guy wants (blonde hair, blue eyes and she's very pretty and has big boobs). A lot of guys hit on her and I'm afraid someone will use her or hurt her so that's why I'm overprotective. But I guess she's going to get married anyway so there's nothing I can do other than to congratulate her. However, the next thing she said shocked me: Her fiance is my best friend. Apparently, they started dating in 2014 and got engaged around Christmas 2018. After hearing this, I felt betrayed and angry. I'm disappointed in both her and my best friend, especially my best friend. No one fucks their best friend's little sister. Nobody does shit like that. To make matters even worse, they hid their relationship from me and my family for 6 years. I'm going to end the friendship with my best friend (a.k.a. future brother-in-law) for being a backstabbing piece of shit. I'm done with him.  

Anyway, I told my sister that I won't go to her wedding or want to have anything to do with her soon-to-be husband and she freaked out. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and give her away (our father died three years ago and I'm her only sibling). But there is no way I'll go to her wedding. I mean my best friend is going to be my brother-in-law? It just feels too weird. So I told her to either walk down the aisle alone or find someone else to do the honor. Well, my sister started crying and begging me to come to her wedding. She says she wants my blessing. But she will never get it because I will never approve of her marriage.

We then talked with our mother and she said I'm being selfish. She also said that I should go to my sister's wedding. But I said it's my choice whether I'm going or not and no one can force me. However, my sister says I'm a horrible brother and that I hurt her feelings. I know it's her special day but I really don't want to see her fiance again.

There's been no contact since. I asked bf when we first met if he was ever curious, he said no, he was happy that man was out of his life and didn't want to talk or think about him ever again. I have respected this, I have not asked questions or initiated to talk about it. I've never seen pictures of him or learned anything about his life.

I've been very curious to see what the father of my boyfriend looks like, and just generally who he is. I just recently (through a comment on a Facebook post) learned his first name, so I decided to look him up on Facebook. I saw pictures, which also revealed that he has gotten new kids in the recent years.

I deleted the browser history and planned on keeping it to myself. Some days pass, and I was going to show bf something on Facebook. When I hit the search bar, his father's name of course showed up.

Bf is very mad. It's hard for him to deal with the fact that I know things about his father's life now. That makes him curious to know what I know. He feels I didn't respect his wishes. I didn't think he'd ever find out, he says that doesn't make it any better. I think it's natural for me to be curious about the future grandfather of our children. I have respected bf's wish by not asking about him for 8 years, and had not planned on taking it any further than just finding out what he looks like.

Bf has not been the same since it happened. I understand that it's hard for him, but I don't think it's right for him to still be mad at me. My intention was always to continue to respect his wishes by never bringing up his father.

We initially only invited my sister, but my sister insisted that her girlfriend (who I think she's been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well.

My sister is in a lesbian relationship and, although my family and I don’t get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. My sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances.

At this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I’m conflicted though. She’s my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation.

It’s been 7 years and he hasn’t gone on a single date. It’s not because he’s not attractive or he’s mean or something like that. Tons of guys have asked him but he rejects them. 

One of my friends really like him and wants to ask him out, we have hung out together before. I asked him if he wanted to go out with him and he said no of course.

0,"AITA for keeping a drawing made by my ex hanging on my apartment's wall? | About ten years ago, my family took a long trip across the world for a two week long vacation. I was 19 at the time; just starting to lighten up from being a real downer of a teenager. I still think of this trip as a real highlight of my life because sometime during that trip a light bulb went on in my head and I realized what an amazing family I have.

The only souvenir I still have from that trip is a 8ft by 10ft cloth with a rooster embroidered on it. I’ve always liked birds and my family had a chicken coop at the time so it made sense.

I moved to NYC the year before and I had that cloth hanging on the wall over my bed all through college and in my first few apartments after college. Three years ago I moved into my current place that is perfect for me, except for the lack of open wall space to hang a massive cloth. I started dating a girl who ended moving into that place, and she created a drawing of the rooster on the cloth and framed it for a gift for some occasion. I hung the drawing on the wall and have the cloth stored at my parents house a few hours away. 

We date for a few years but break it off pretty amicably in the middle of last year, she finds another place and we both move on with our lives. The only thing remaining of hers in my apartment is the framed drawing. It reminds me of that trip, not of her. 

A few months later, a good friend and I realize we have feelings for each other and we have been dating now for most of this year. I’ve never been happier, I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman and that has been clear to me since soon after this relationship started.

 I never mentioned that the drawing came from my ex because it honestly hadn’t crossed my mind as possibly being weird or something I should mention. We had a little get together with some of my girlfriend’s friends at our apartment last weekend and it was a blast, as usual. My girlfriend’s friend (L) set the whole brunch up. L has been close friends with my current girlfriend since college, but had also met and become friends with my ex in the last year of that relationship. She also seemed unhappy when I started to date my current girlfriend and tried to convince me to give my ex another try. Yesterday, my girlfriend mentions that her friend (L) told her it was super weird that I still had that photo up. I told her the whole truth about it and offered to take it down. She said I should keep it up because it fills the space on that wall nicely.

Even though she told me to keep it up I can’t help but feel like I’m the asshole if I do. She’s the most kind, caring, and compassionate person I’ve ever met so I can definitely see her swallowing whatever she really wanted to say so as not to start a fight. I could just go get the cloth from my parents’ place and fold/cut it and frame it. I just get so much joy when I see that dang rooster I don’t want to take it down until I can replace it.

I'm a lady in my early 30s. I have younger siblings but we are within 4 years of each other so I didn't help with baby stuff (or if I did I don't remember.) No kids for me as of now, but between friends, acquaintances, and current/former coworkers, I know seven pregnant ladies. One of which is my best friend of 20 years ""Lana"" who is due in early December.

Full disclosure: babies kind of terrify me. They are tiny and fragile and can't communicate and I'm always terrified of breaking them. Especially when they're newborns and they're extra small. Everyone says ""oh it'll be different when it's your own"" but again, none of these babies are mine.

Lana and I were talking the other day and she was telling me things about being pregnant I didn't know. I offhandedly mention I don't even know how to change a diaper. She says oh, I'll teach you. I say hmm no thanks. Oh no it'll be so easy! I can show you! No thank you I don't want to learn. She goes, not even for **my** baby? I say yes and she gets upset. How am I going to babysit for her and her husband if I don't know how to change a diaper? Um...I don't WANT to babysit. Again, not even for **my** baby? I remind her newborns/infants make me crazy nervous and I would not want to be completely alone and responsible for one. She gets even more upset saying I'm going to have to learn sometime if I have kids and she trusts me and she's going to need help etc. etc.

I told her I'm willing to help to the best of my abilities. I will come over with food, help clean, do laundry, run to the store, etc; whatever I can and I know she trusts me as a person but I am not the right person to watch an infant, I know nothing about their care and even if I did, I would not be comfortable. She said maybe I should leave, and we haven't really talked since.

I talked to some friends, and they were a little divided. Some say I was honest & upfront and they'd appreciate that, and others say I should just suck it up and learn how now because I'll need to eventually and I know so many pregnant ladies so I'll be able to help them too and I can't expect to just do the fun baby stuff.

He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn’t help it… it just… looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don’t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it…

Now I’ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked… “Papa, what is that?” and I just, blurted out… “It’s Play-doh, baby!”

So, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some “clay to play with”, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother’s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails… the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother’s dessert. He wasn’t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches’ vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.

1,"AITA for forcefully putting up pictures of my own dog in MIL’s house? | Throwaway...

My husband and I have 3 dogs and no kids. This apparently really pisses off my MIL who lives alone a few hours away. Whenever we go over on holidays she makes a point to mention that “dogs don’t count as kids” usually because my husband’s siblings will gift us seasonal dog gifts in lieu of kids toys. 

Anyways, it came to a head last christmas when I was admiring all the family photos she put up in this big cabinet and noticed that on our shelf there were a few VERY badly cropped photos of me and my husband and no dogs (with dogs cropped out). Like it looked terrible because sometimes half our faces were chopped off and there’d be a random paw by our legs. She obviously did it just to exclude our dogs who were very much a part of that particular photo shoot. I didn’t say anything but was pretty ticked off inside.

Well, we were over again last weekend so my husband could pick up some documents. I secretly brought a copy of the photo that she had crudely chopped and when they were in the other room
I just slipped that picture over the one she already had. 

Long story short she didn’t notice until last night and called my husband asking if I did this. I said yeah but told her I noticed her picture was a weird crop so I went ahead and fixed it with the right one. She flipped out and called me a thief, despite the fact that the real pic is still under there.

Hours later she texted me since I couldn't make it she called her ex lets call him David and she is drinking with him. She just send some drunk voice mails and  kept ignoring me whole night.

She knows that I don't want her to spend time with him especially alone. Every time she says he is gay and has a bf and they just went out for a couple months in high school it meant nothing and he is just a best friend to him. Even though I do not like this I allow her to see him with their other friends around.

So when she texted like nothing had happened I told her she knew I don't want her ex to be involved in our life and instead of apologizing she told me she wish she never told me they dated and and that I am controlling her friendships. When I stand my ground and told I can't allow this she just offered me to hangout with David more and see what kind of person he is and how he is like a brother.

This happened over the weekend, when she didn’t work and I did. I got home from work a little after 5 and she and my mom were drinking wine and talking on the couch. When I came through the door my sister immediately stopped talking. Only my mom said hi to me or even seemed to care I was home. 

When I came up after getting changed, I went to pour myself some wine that was on the counter that they were drinking. My sister rudely said “Excuse me that’s mine.

I decided not to bother with the wine and went to sit in the living room with them where they were whispering. 

When my sister noticed I was settling in, I heard her say to my mom “I’m going to go okay. Well finish later.” And she started to leave the room.

I admit I got angry. I don’t know why she hates my presence so much and why she had to leave just because I came up. I said as much, kind of yelling “You don’t have to fucking leave the room just because I’m home. I had a long day at work and I would appreciate company and venting too. Finish your conversation.”

0,"AITA for denying my best friend a luxury hotel getaway because of my abortion? | My partner and I had an unplanned pregnancy. (Condom broke, we used the morning after pill but I still ended up conceiving)

After consulting with my family, doctors and my partner, we decided for an abortion. Due to a recent health condition of mine that put me at risk, this was a choice made in regards to my physical and mental health. Neither of us were ready for a baby regardless, so this was the right decision for the both of us. 

Fortunately, despite this being the toughest decision of my entire life, my family, partner and close friends were very supportive. 

Seeing as I was only 8 weeks pregnant, we opted for the medical route (abortion pills). After taking the second pill, you get sent home and have the induced miscarriage there. To make this painful experience as comfortable as possible, my partner offered to book a beautiful hotel room near the clinic. (My home was over an hour away)

I was touched by his thoughtfulness and told my best friend, who hates my partner, by the way.  She wanted to join me in the hotel instead of him, to ‘support’ me. 

She went on to say that my partner should pay for a full spa treatment for the both of us. This comment caught me off-guard. 

I wasn’t going to the hotel for a fun, fancy weekend, but to be close to the clinic and have a comfortable and clean environment. Aside from that, my partner intended to be there for me and I *wanted* him there. 

This made her upset. She said that I chose him over her, was dismissing her needs for relaxation (she was stressed from work) and was being selfish and narcissistic. I should always chose my best friend over any man, she added. [Side Note: She was supportive 60% of the time, which I’m thankful for. But she also made remarks that it wasn’t that big of a deal, my fear was unjustified and only in my head, it wouldn’t hurt anyways, etc.]

It escalated a little, but ultimately the abortion took place and I went there with my partner, not her. No spa treatments, by the way, just the most painful experience of my life.

Afterwards, she kept bringing up that she should have been there instead of my partner.

On september of 2018 my mom was diagnosed with stomachal cancer at stage four. The two of us lived in the capital of my country, I’m her only daughter and my father passed away 19 years ago, since then my mom was single and my closer family, my aunt and my grandma, live four hours south of us. In the beginning they traveled once a month to see my mom, they even spent christmas and new years with us that year, and it was great to feel the support of my family at that time. 


Sadly my mom didn’t take her diagnosis really well and i had to start making decisions for the economic well being of the two of us, because cancer is a fucking expensive disease, such as having to move from a big and well located apartment to a smaller one in a modest part of the city that was just big enough to fit my mom, me and a spare bed cause i thought they would come to visit, but in 2019 through all the period of time that i would go with my mom to chemos, hospitalized and everything I was alone with her.


They basically disappeared, my grandma came to visit every 2 months but my aunt literally disappeared, of course she would call me and tell me to go visit her but i was a nineteen year old woman taking care of her sick mother, the economy of the house and going to med school, so i didn’t have any time of energy to travel to visit her. 
Through all this process i talked to them several times saying that i couldn’t do it alone but my aunt told me that it was really difficult for her travel to see me. Even though they travelled to shop several times in the capital, coming for the day and didn’t even talking to me. I just got to know they were here because of social media.
By the end of the year i was exhausted, and was struggling so hard with my mental and physical health.


On december of 2019 my mom passed away, and i started to take decisions such as with who i was going to live based on economic and personal things, and i decided to live with my boyfriend with whom i’ve been with for more than 3 years cause i don’t want to live alone. I’m independent in terms of money since i got an insurance paid and i can sustain myself until i graduate med school

But in January of this year, one month after my mother passed away, my aunt called me and asked me if my cousin (M, 18) could live with me cause he is starting  college in my city, and i said no cause i don’t want to be in charge of someone after the year i’ve been gone through, after feeling so alone and overwhelmed with everything.
After that answer she told me that it wasn’t going to be like that, that she didn’t want him to be alone, that i could teach him how to move around the city, and that sounded to me to taking care of someone and i stood with my decision of saying no.
I have seen her a couple of times after that talk and recently she told me that she was really hurt by the decision i made because family is above my boyfriend and stuff like that.

1,"AITA for explaining to a vegan activist exactly why im not vegan? | Anonymous for the voiceless (Google them) were doing one of their protests in my city recently, and since I had time to kill before my train arrived I stopped to investigate.

One of the protestors struck up a conversation with me, and for the most part she seemed pretty chill. She talked about how we exploit farm animals, I talked about the food chain and human evolution, yadda yadda... and eventually I agreed that humans could live solely on plants if we wanted to, and that it would be better for both our health and the environment if we did.

She then asked me ""So why aren't you vegan?"" and I responded with ""Because I don't want my friends and family to see me as a self-righteous snob.""

Unsurprisingly she was quite offended, so I told her all about the things PETA do, about about all the times I've been called 'murderer' for eating meat, about the sort of things that vegans have a reputation for (you all know what I'm talking about) and I also told her the story of that bride who wanted a vegan-only wedding which made the rounds on Reddit not long ago. My explaining failed to un-offend her, so I said that I would consider being vegan if veganism ever fixed its public image, and went to catch my train.

This was last weekend and I still feel like I was a bit too blunt with my answer... Am I the asshole?

Basically I met this girl """"Jen"""", who showed every sign of being into me outside of flat out saying it, and we hung out enough that I actually let her meet my friends (!). Now this girl was apparently ""off"" according to my friends, and while she added them and wanted to hang out, they were visually not very into this girl. I kept on living life though, until I made my move. 

I asked her out, and she gave me that ""friends"" schtick. I was surprised, and honestly a bit outraged (?), since she had shown so many signs that she was into me too. 

After sort of getting over the ""pissed the hell off and newly rejected"" stage, I texted all my friends basically saying ""Well, Jen was a total flop, you're all free to unfriend her if you like"", since I knew they didn't really care for her. Just a sort of giving them my blessings on something they'd probably do anyway. I followed suit of course.

The morning after I wake up to an angry phone call from Jen, saying all my friends had blocked her, and that I was a petty piece of shit for making them cut her off like that. I tried explaining my side, and that they did it quite willingly, but she never really stopped being angry. This was monday, and she's still giving me death glares when I walk by.

Always fun games and trivia and it has become a staple of our friend group's holiday traditions. I think its important to note that this party ALWAYS takes place on his actual birthday and it is always hosted at his house.

This year he sent out an invite as usual and his birthday falls on a Sunday.

Maybe 2-3 days later I get another invitation from Tom's GF, Julie(19f). Its an invite for a surprise party. I think this is a little weird but assume its a small event for close friends out at a bar. 

I check the Facebook invite though and see that she has invited the entire party. I also notice the location is set for Tom's house and the date is a DAY before his actual party.

I'm pretty confused at this point. I'm not really sure what the point is in having a surprise party a day before Tom's event that he looks forward to every year. I'm also worried that this change in plans will stress Tom.

I'm not the only one confused as people on the invite list message me asking for clarity and eventually a group chat gets started with our close friends on how to handle this situation.

We eventually decide its probably best for me to message Julie and try to see if she would be willing make the surprise party a smaller event at a bar so Tom can still have his event as planned.  We write up a very nice message to send that is supportive of her idea while also firm that we think this would step on the toes of tom's party.

No dice, Julie completely ignores our carefully crafted message and tells us that she thinks Saturday would work better and we will do everything Tom had planned for sunday... on saturday. I try to negotiate further but there is little budging.

At this point the groupchat is divided. Some just want as little conflict as possible and are willing to move mountains for Tom to make sure he is still socially comfortable and traditions are maintained. Others are wanting to boycott this party and view it as another power move from Julie which she is somewhat known for.

I see both sides, I know Tom would just want as little conflict as possible but I also know he is someone who struggles to find confidence and this party is always an event where he is truly in control. 

Its also become my job to use the key Tom gave me to let everyone in to his house. I am just feeling way too involved for something that I don't fully support.

I'm always on my family's bad side so I appreciated the neutral input last time.

Somehow it's become a tradition in my family that one family member host a Friday night dinner once a month. Last night was my night. My oldest sister and I have not been speaking since our vacation (click on user name to see why if you're curious) and I was able to avoid her at the January and February dinner at other's houses. I really, really didn't want her in my apartment. So I decided since she hates spicy food and her kids are allegedly allergic to peanuts, I could side step the  issue and make this Thai peanut noodle dish that I love. I announced it well in advance in the group email what I was planning. 

Well since my sister is much more diabolical than I give her credit for, she had her husband drive the 2 hours to my place, feign that she didn't know I was making something that allowed her to say ""you know my family can't eat! Isn't the point of a family dinner so all the family can enjoy!"" While clutching her pearls (literally). Then my niece claimed she could feel the ""peanut residue in the air"" and it was affecting her ability to breathe. So my sister dramatically took her to the emergency room where all turned out to be fine.

But again, I lost. My sister played me like a fiddle and the entire family took her side. Dinner was ruined and I'm the bad guy. Again. I honestly just tried to side step the issue of having her around but making somthing she and her kids couldn't eat--and announcing it well in advance.

1,"AITA for exposing my buddies reddit account to our other buddies? | Backstory:  A couple months back I was lurking on my local communities' subreddit and was commenting on a post of someone who got a job and would be moving to the area and wanted to low down on apartments/housing/etc.  While I was lurking on that post, I immediately noticed another account that I new for sure belonged to a local friend of mine.  How did I immediately know it was my friends you may ask?  Well I live in a small mountain community so its already a limited pool of people who would be commenting on this post AND he used his first name plus the first 3 letters of his last name as his account name ... suffice to say it was completely obvious that this account was his.  Of course curiosity got the better of me and I browsed his history (nothing special or relationship changing) and then moved on with my life.

Fast forward to yesterday at the bar for trivia night with the friend, me, and some other buddies:  In between the trivia rounds we conversate, as folks do, and somehow reddit came up in the conversation and I told the story to everyone how I found my friends reddit account.  My other friends egged me on to show me his account so I did.  I didn't think much of it as its just a reddit account and he doesn't post deplorable shit or anything embarrassing; the most he does is shit post about sports but even then its hardly shit posting.  I also didn't think its a big deal b/c I'm just not the type of person that takes reddit too seriously.

WELL my friend DID think it was a big deal and got somewhat irate.  At first I thought he was being sarcastic but he was actually a little bit bothered.  He claimed that I had broke some sort of  sacred reddit code where one does not expose reddit accounts to the meat realm... this secret code is news to me?  I fired back a lil and said something to the effect of ""what the hell do you expect if your posting on small local community subreddit with almost your entire name as your username"".  Anyways, my other buddies made fun of him for getting 'triggered' and we got over it but I promised him I'd make this post to get to the bottom of this.

&#x200B;

Anyways, me and my gf both have grown up with the same language being our first. Overtime we both became bilingual due to schooling and generally being around English speakers. Where we kind of split off at is that my girlfriend is not as fluent anymore as I am. She can speak and understand it and it isn't anywhere near having ""lost"" it, she just has issues with grammar and a slightly less lengthy vocabulary. 

&#x200B;

Recently, I have asked her if she can speak to me in our language more often because we both are very proud of our culture and it is a very big part of our identities. She shot me down and when asked why she told me that she feels uncomfortable knowing that I would be able to tell when she messes up and that she already feels judged enough by her family who constantly tease her for being the most ""whitewashed"". I told her I didn't care about her little mistakes and just want to have this between us. She still refuses and says that I teased her similarly before, which I have but never thought more of it since she just brushes it off or jokes along with it. I still bring up the request from time to time and her response hasn't changed.

My bf Ben is one of those ""never met a stranger"" people. He’s  friendly, outgoing and makes friends easily and often. We live in a big city and he is probably the only person who knows all his neighbors by name and something about them. Ben has a lot of interests and meets new people (men and women) through these and ends up being friends with them and inviting them to other things. I don't really mind but it’s annoying when it’s a female bc there have been instances in the past where they get crushes on Ben and, although I trust him, I would rather not have some chick flirting with my bf (he doesn’t flirt back and usually stops inviting those girls or tries to fix them up with a friend). This past spring Ben met Leah through a running group. She was new to town, in a similar industry as Ben and they have tons in common. Ben invited her to trivia night. Leah is not only beautiful but she's funny, athletic and interesting. While I wasn't cold or mean to her I didn't seek her out in conversation and always held her at arm’s length. Turns out they are training for the same marathon so she also joined his long run group. Leah fit in with our friend group so she is around often. Since she and Ben are in the same industry, she's also at some networking things, too. I was getting tired of her being around all the time and a little insecure bc they have so much in common but they've never done or said anything that makes me suspicious. I've even glanced at their text exchanges (Ben asked me to look up an address she had sent in a text so I wasn't snooping) and there is nothing flirty or inappropriate. He's mentioned before that it doesn't seem like I like Leah and I've always denied it and said we just don't have a lot in common or I was busy talking to someone else. 

Well, a couple weeks ago Leah shows up with Jill and introduces her as her girlfriend. Ben says something like ""oh, its so nice to finally meet you"" indicating he'd known Leah was a lesbian. I won't lie- I felt a huge weight lifted off me and had more fun that night than since Leah joined our group. Ever since then I've talked to her more and found  I really like her. The other day, someone made a joke about how I was an asshole until I found out Leah was a lesbian and not going to steal Ben away. Leah laughed it off but Ben looked a little bothered and asked me later if that was true. I admitted that her being a lesbian made me more comfortable with their friendship. He was upset with me and thought that showed a lack of trust and faith in him. I told him that he knew I wasn't totally comfortable with their friendship and it would've been nice of him to tell me she was a lesbian. He said that he had just found out about two weeks before I did and that it wasn't his place to ""out"" her to me and he thought I didn't like her for something else, not bc I was jealous.

0,"AITA for wanting to go to bed on my own? | This is my first ever post, so bear with me here.

Basically, I (17F) have a super close relationship with my dad. He and my mom split up when I was 7, and ever since I switch between being with my mom and my dad. At my dad's house, it's just me and him, so we've gotten really close (not in a creepy way). Whenever I'm there, we spend a lot of time playing games, watching movies, etc. Now more than ever since the shut down happened. 

My dad also happens to be really fond of following little ""traditions"", like going to the same restaurants on the same days, eating the same things on holidays, watching TV shows the night they come out, etc. He will move plans to accommodate his traditions. Most I don't have a problem with at all, and they can be really fun. 

However, he has a tradition where, every night, he has to put me to bed. This essentially constitutes of him giving me a hug, letting me get under the covers, sitting on the edge of the bed to chit chat for a bit, getting up, then turning off the light for me and leaving. I know it sounds harmless, but in all the years that I've known him, he's never not done this before, and I feel like I'm being treated like a little kid. 

I don't need to have the light turned off for me, and it feels weird that he follows the same routine every night. Sometimes I just wanna be able to go into my room and turn off my own light and go to sleep on my terms. At my mom's house, I usually say goodnight to her upstairs, and then go down to my bedroom where I put myself to bed just fine. 

It seems so trivial, but it bothers me. I brought it up to him once and tried to put myself to bed, but he joked about how I just wanted to stay up (I don't, just want some independence), and then got hurt that I was trying to break our tradition. 

I feel like he just doesn't want me to grow up and have more independence, or he just really can't stray from the same patterns he's always used. I just find it kinda annoying that he always has to come into my room and turn off the light for me. Everyone who I've talked to who is my age says that it's kinda weird and their parents don't do that, but I could also just be a teen who's close to being an adult and fighting for independence when I don't need to be.

It was even funnier because there were girls their own age all over rhe bar but apparently these guys thought the ""Cougars"" were a sure thing.

In the time that we were together, I went to college which he paid for with his money from his job (trucking). He spent about $20K on my 3 years of school. I got my associates and passed the NCLEX and started as an RN. With the money from my job, I gave him $30K a few years later that he could use as the down payment for his own commercial truck.

I asked my mom a few medical questions and she keeps saying my bros are dying to meet me and such.  I feel bad cause I am technically there oldest brother and I could imagine them wanted to meet me.  But I also feel like I don't owe them anything.  Anyways the reason I am writing this was the other day, my bio bro approached me out of the blue in a public place. I have no idea how he found out where I was. He just approached me and said hey I'm your brother.  I stood shocked and then quickly excused myself and said I had to go to the bathroom and basically bolted out of there.  He messaged me on FB right after saying sorry but he just wants to meet me and was hoping we could have a relationship.  I feel a bit of mixed emotions about the whole thing.

1,"AITA for not telling my (Possibly Ex) Fiancé about my son? | Throwaway, obvious reasons. 

It’s kind of weird to post this to reddit, but here is my conundrum. 

I am going to get married soonish to a lovely woman, or rather was. I have had lots of issues in life, just about certain lifestyles I’ve had in the past, a real party type kid and in that time I had many relationships and one-night stands.

This was a really long time ago and I’ve changed since then into a more mature man, and have committed myself to this woman I love, but recently, I bumped into an Ex while on a work trip and she had a 10 year old with her, and I was very sure it was mine. My co-worker eventually pieced it together and he knows too. 

My Ex had changed a lot too and became a mature woman herself, so we caught up and she told me that I was the father of her child and I feel like my world has turned upside down. She opted to not tell me, because of the lifestyle I had lived. 

This is big, and I wanted to tell my fiancé but my Ex told me if I wanted to have a relationship with my son, that nobody could know I was the father, I guess out of embarrassment or something, and that included my fiancé. 

I was devasted, but of course I wanted a relationship with him so I decided not to tell my fiancé.

And, well, she found out when she got pretty suspicious of my co-workers behaviour, and found out that I hadn’t planned on telling her despite my Ex’s conditions and now she might leave me.

Mini background: Boyfriend and I have been together for some time. We’re very happy. We have talked about marriage before in what I had always felt were very vague terms. I would like to marry him one day but at present, we are neither engaged nor do we even live together. We are in our 30s. 

Recently we were talking about a friend’s upcoming wedding and I said something to the effect of, “if I get married this is something I’d like to have at my wedding.”

He got mildly upset and asked, “don’t you mean WHEN WE get married?” 

I apologized for upsetting him and explained that because we’re not engaged, it didn’t feel right speaking in definitive terms like that, and also that I didn’t want to give the impression I was putting any pressure on him (I’m not - propose, don’t propose, I’m not going anywhere anyway.) He said it still bothered him, I apologized again and privately decided to avoid this topic until such a time that it DOES become a definitive in our lives, should it ever.

Anyways after 3 years my aunt went back to Nicaragua because she did not like it here, I can count in one hand the amount of times I’ve talked to her since she left. So the other day, i receive a text message on WhatsApp from her asking me how I was, etc etc.... I respond to her and tell her that I am currently at work that I won’t be able to text her back. She responds saying it’s fine, that we could talk later.

&#x200B;

Jenny has been very up-front with Jake about what she expects from him, from day one. She wants to start a family, eventually stop working to be a  stay-at-home mom, ect. She also expects him to be more mature than he has been, ie, no all-nighters drinking, no playing video games til 4 am, things that we did during college we shouldn't be doing anymore. She's also said, many times, she explicitly is not okay with him going to strip clubs. Her exact words on the subject were, ""If he went along for someone else's bachelor party, and didn't get any dances or anything, I *GUESS* I could be okay with it. But the second he's getting lap dances, I'm done.""

&#x200B;

Jake's bachelor party is coming up the first weekend in August. He's already expressed his explicit desire that, regardless of what we do during the day, every night he wants to get hammered, do drugs (marijuana at the least, but he's experimented with other substances before when drunk) and go to strip clubs.

He also talked me into going to strip clubs with him before I knew she wasn't okay with that happening. I realize that, if one of his oldest friends bails on his bachelor party, it'll raise questions, and possibly make his fiance suspicious, which honestly, I would probably be okay with.

Fast forward to high school, I had found a solid group of friends and we would often party at each other’s houses. It was never anything too hard, maybe a few beers, but never anything much more. My mom has always been super chill, so our get togethers were often held at my place.

Eventually, word got around that we had a spacious backyard and it became the hot spot for high school partying. People beyond my general friend group were showing up to our parties. It was at this point that my mother met ‘Adam’. Adam was always a year ahead of me in high school (he graduated in ‘15, I graduated in ‘16). I had spoken to him before on few occasions but only considered him a mutual acquaintance.

One night, he and my mom got into a deep conversation and they apparently exchanged phone numbers. He moved away after he graduated to attend university, but they continued to secretly text one another. One night, my mother confessed all of this to me and told me that Adam was planning to move back after his freshmen year of college so that he could be closer to her. He would transfer to a closer university and finish his degree there. 

A few months later, I graduated and moved out of state to attend university myself. Adam indeed moved back to be closer to my mother and they announced they were officially dating. I was just ready to get the hell away from home at this point and not have to deal with what I figured was going to be a ‘fuck buddy’ ordeal. 

Angry at my mother, I decided to stop talking to her once I moved away. I would ignore her phone calls and simply respond with a short text to assure her everything was good. Eventually, she stopped calling and the only time we would connect was through the occasional text message.

Two years later, Adam proposed to my mother. I keep in often touch with my younger siblings. They are now 18, 16, & 13 and keep me somewhat updated on their lives and our mothers relationship. They were all very disturbed by the relationship initially, but they’ve all seemed to have been brainwashed to jump on board with it. My sisters claim he’s a good guy who truly loves our mom. My brother is a bit more doubtful but he still seems to be generally accepting of it. I’ve tried telling them that it’s not a healthy relationship but they always brush me off, telling me they don’t want to anger or upset our mom.

He skipped on court-ordered child support for me and my brothes (22m, 20m) for years and we pretty much had no contact from 2014-2019. In 2018, after we reached a settlement in Court, he started to pay CS again and gave us some land he had to cover the amount he didn't pay in the last four years (the land transfer was my mother's idea)

Last year he reached out to my brothers and I and we started a relationship with him (my mother suggest that we talk to him to try and get him to pay more than what was decided on the settlement), however things went sour betwen him and my brothers (as he paid child support after the deadline and ""fired"" my brother that was - remotely - interning for him because his company wasn't doing well and he couldn't afford the extra costs), however I decided that I had no problem with him and kept the relationship going. Menwhile my relationship with my mother has been going from bad the worst, we fight constantly and she is very abusive towards me.

She then asked what I was doing and I told her that I'd be staying over at my boyfriends (which is true and I will) and couldn't reschedule because I want to spend time with him before he travels (also true). No one said anything else, but then my brother texted me angry saying that he knows I'm going out with our father and not with my bf because our father invited him (my brother) to come as well.

0,"AITA for wanting a new ring? | My husband and I have been together 9 years and married for 3. Sometime after getting engaged and before getting married, we went to the local mall and I picked out a beautiful and affordable ring for us at the time. The issue is not the style or look of the ring, but the materials. Affordable for us at the time meant lower quality metals. To keep the ring nice, it came with instructions not to sleep in it or get it too wet too frequently. The manufacturer of the ring included a warranty that they would replace the ring one time should it get damaged beyond wear. We used that warranty about 1 year after having the ring. 

Nowadays (well, before the current world situation) I'm a preschool teacher. I'm constantly washing my hands and getting sticky, and other not-good-for-the-ring things. Not to mention that I've owned it for years now and worn it regularly. The rose gold tone is wearing off (like it did before replacing) and the metal underneath makes me itchy and turn green. The stones have lost their luster so it looks permanently dirty. All of this means I can't wear it much anymore. 

I found a ring online that was similar in style and made with more quality materials. It is affordable for us (I would be paying for it myself anyway) and I asked my husband about getting it. I told him the issues I have with my current ring being careful not to mention its ""lesser quality"". I tried to explain from a place of ""I'm currently not able to wear my ring frequently and I dont like taking it off"". 

He was less than thrilled. He asked if I wanted to replace all of the jewelry he's gotten for me which is ridiculous. I told him I was looking for an everyday ring and wanted to save the current one for more special occasions. I maybe TA for that because it's not 100% true. If I got this new ring, I dont know that I'd wear my current one anymore. 

I feel like he's blowing this way out of proportion. It's not like I said the original ring was ugly or terrible. I picked it out for fucks sake. I dont think it's crazy to want an upgrade now that we can afford to get one.",False,False,3,2,4,1,1,3,Loyalty

He accepted and thanked them for the gift. They still got upset that they didn’t hear about it afterward though - that he hadn’t told me to tell them he was reading it and appreciating all the hard work they had put into it. They keep bringing it up - and are very upset by this. They claim this is one of the reasons they do not respect my relationship with him.

1,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she's miserable because she refuses to go on vacation with me? | Hey guys, I've been with my girlfriend for about a year and she's honestly a pain in the ass when it comes to leaving home. She has Aspergers and her anxiety is through the roof so normally I get it but I'm sick of her excuses to not do things with me. An important thing to note is that my girlfriend is a night owl and I very much am not.

I asked her if she'd join me for a weekend trip, just 3 days at a place about 4 hours away in the car. She said no as expected, because she doesn't want to share the same room and listen to my snoring all night. I've never heard anyone else say I snore but apparently it's ""unbearable"" to her so she selfishly refuses to even try to sleep next to me. I stay up as late as 1am trying to get her to sleep in the same space as me but she won't because she's ""not tired"" so she will stay up until 5am and crawl into bed an hour before I have to leave. Personally I feel like she's avoiding me. 

I am getting tired of her refusing to come with me, I'm meant to be doing things with my life partner but she won't. When I talk to her about it I end up furious, she says I'm not taking her perspective into mind but how hard is it to go a few days without sleep away from home? For your partner for Christ's sake? She claims that being away from home makes her depression worse, which I think is utter bullshit. She's depressed because she stays inside all the time in the same town, if she actually got out she wouldn't have any of the issues she has. I told her this and that she is the cause of her own issues but she just wants to be the victim. That was a little harsh I'll admit but she is beyond unreasonable, she will only do something for me if it's in her comfort zone. But what the hell can I do, she says that I'm ignorant, despite having depression myself. 

Either way, I'm at my breaking point with her. I've had enough of arguing over things she refuses to change for me.

He has a younger brother, 25, who has been dating his girlfriend (21) for 3 years. They are not engaged yet but she is very close with his family.

My husband’s sister got married Friday evening. There was a church ceremony and a evening reception. Leading up to the event, me and the other women in the family shared what we were wearing to make sure nothing overlapped or was too similar. It all worked out fine.

Then, at the evening reception, my BIL’s girlfriend showed up in this stunning red gown that was nearly identical to mine. Same off the shoulder neckline, same colour, same skirt, the only difference was the material. I was extremely pissed. I didn’t say anything to her during the reception, but a lot of people were complimenting her gown and saying she looked beautiful, gorgeous, etc. 

This morning after the reception, I told her I didn’t appreciate the stunt that she pulled with the dress. She said she was sorry, but at the last minute she decided that she liked the red gown better and that she didn’t remember what mine looked like. She told me to “chill out” and “stop overreacting.”

I just feel like she’s trying to upstage me for some reason. Of course people were going to compare us since we were wearing basically the same thing and sitting at the same table. And she’s a super skinny, tall fashion model while I’m a normal sized woman. Of course people are going to hold me up to her impossible standard. Frankly I think she knew this and just wanted to be cruel. I don’t like her and this just further solidies my feelings for her.

Worse thing is, she is being supported by literally everyone else in my hisband’s family. They all think she’s so gorgeous and sweet and can do no wrong.

1,"AITA for proposing to my girlfriend (now fiancee) with a ring I originally gave to my ex-fiancée? | I know from the title it sounds less than great but please read the whole post. 

Long story short, I was engaged to this girl like five years ago. In hindsight the engagement was impulsive and basically a last ditch effort to save the relationship. Predictably, things didn’t work out. She gave me back the ring. (She literally had the things for like two weeks and barely wore it). 

I initially planned to sell or pawn the ring. I don’t know why I didn’t. I just kept  postponing it and it never got done. 

Fast forward to now. I have an amazing girl that I’m completely in love with. We talked a lot about marriage. The only issue is that I’m having to be a lot more careful with my money. She also wants to have a baby relatively soon so there’s that to consider. 

I decided that I already have a ring that’s basically in new condition. I still could have sold or pawned it. But my now-fiancée and I had talked about rings and stuff as well and this was really close to what she said she wanted. So I don’t know. I guess I romanticized it in my mind thinking “this is the girl that should have had it all along.”  Maybe that’s stupid, I don’t know. 

Anyway I proposed with it. What I didn’t realize was that my ex actually follows my fiancée on Instagram (why, I do not know!) and so she saw the ring. She, being the lovely person that she is, goes and DMs my fiancée to say that she thinks that’s the same engagement ring she got. 

My fiancée confronts me all upset. I was honest and told her what happened. I immediately offered to buy another ring but she wasn’t having it. She even said she needs to think about whether she still wants to get married. That stung, as you can imagine, and I’m hoping (praying) she was just talking out of anger. 

Honestly, my ex moved like two states away after we broke up. I never expected them to get in contact with each other or I would never have put my fiancée in this position. Again, I love this woman to death.

They have stayed friends for a long time and they play a lot of video games together. She vents to him about a lot of stuff especially stuff about our marriage. Which is cool because she can have her friends, and needs people to talk to. 

He’s a marine and his Christmas leave is coming up.  He told her that he has no one to go home to or spend his leave with.

We have a 2 (will be roughly 2 and a half by the time of the holiday) year old son who my mum wants to take on holiday. My sister and family are going so there'll be other kids there.

Her car was in the shop, so I offered to pick her up. I got off work at 4pm, and then I was ready to go get her. 

I texted my wife these plans and she got upset. 

She said she had to get the kids from school, get groceries, make dinner and get the kids ready. She said she didn’t want my mom to be sitting there watching her going 100 miles an hour while she did everything and that if I was getting off work early she could use the help instead of me driving and getting my mom. 

The drive to my mom’s is about 10-15 minutes, so it wouldn’t take much at all to go get her. 

She told me to try and see this from her side, but all I saw was her getting mad that my mom was coming over. 

She told me that I could get off work a little later than 4pm so I could time it and be able to pick my mom up and then go directly to the school. 

But I already told my boss that I was leaving at 4 and so that’s the time I was going to leave. 

I tried to explain that the timing wouldn’t matter, and that my mom could sit in the driveway and wait until we were ready since she didn’t want her sitting inside. 

She said the timing wouldn’t matter for me, since I was just driving, but that she had 100 things to do and didn’t need an audience. 

We argued about it for a while. I just didn’t understand why I couldn’t get my mom. I kept telling my wife this, but she went on and on about the timing of everything and kept listing all she had to do and asking me to try and see it from her perspective. 

I told her fine, she could just have her way and my mom wouldn’t go. 

But this made my wife even madder, she said that that’s not what she was saying at all. She asked me to come up with a solution instead of arguing because I ‘obviously wasn’t listening’ to her, and I told her that me going to get my mom when I got off work at 4pm was the solution. 

But whatever, my mom just wouldn’t go then. 

I told my wife she could just have her way and that whenever she doesn’t agree with me we fight because she doesn’t get her way. She said that it was the opposite. That if she disagrees with me or brings up her concerns I ignore them or don’t listen.

If that’s the case,  why is she the one always yelling and calling me a selfish asshole?

She then told me that since I need her to be my mother and problem solve for me, she suggested that I go run a quick errand that I’ve been needing to do for a while now, and then after that go pick up my mom and go directly to the school. 

That made sense, so that’s what I did but I just don’t get it. My mom could have easily just sat in our house and waited until we were ready to go.

About 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn’t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. 

Fast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa’s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it’s just Melissa and me.

Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn’t feeling well and left.  

Yesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):

> Amy: It sucks that you’ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. 

> Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?

> Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she’s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. 

> Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I’ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I’ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. 

> Amy: I trust you and I don’t think you’d cheat but I still think it’s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.

Kim is a bit of a spoiled princess that’s used to getting everything she wants.

So I decided not to go, because if she was already getting this upset over something like pizza, then I don’t want to spend one of my nights off around her. None of the guys were upset, they wanted me to come but understood why I bailed. One last thing is we all hang our pretty regularly as a group anyways. So Kim sees us all once every week or so anyways. It's not that the guy's never get to see each-other, but we just haven't had a guy's only night in nearly a year.

1,"AITA for ""abandoning"" my daughter? | I split from my ex about a year ago. The divorce was messy and long story short, she took our daughter and went back to her home state. My parents moved to where I currently live before our divorce and since I was paying the mortgage on their house and financially supporting them in addition to being unable to relocate due to work, I decided I was staying put. I've also met someone else and we're now expecting our first kid together which makes relocating even less of an option.

It's made the logistics of seeing my daughter harder though but I try to visit at least once a month and talk to her every day. However I had to miss her first day of school because my girlfriend wasn't feeling well due to her pregnancy and I got hit with last minute work stuff. My ex called me repeatedly, trying to insist that I come down for this, and I explained to my daughter that I couldn't come because I had alot going on but I love her very much and would see her soon. She was sad but said okay. I also had to cancel my Thanksgiving  Christmas visit because of my gf's pregnancy. Recently my daughter asked me if I'd ever live with her again, and I tried to gently explain that no, because I can't leave my job and because I'm going to have another baby soon but we would see eachother lots. I was talking about this with the guy's at work, and with the exception of one, all told me I was a huge asshole that's ditched my kid for a ""piece of ass"". I feel that I'm stuck in an impossible situation. My ex won't move back here and I have no desire to keep her from her support network, my gf is pregnant and her kids also see me as a surrogate dad now, and I have my parents to support. I can't just drop everything to move somewhere else. I feel bad about it but don't think I'm doing the wrong thing.

My dad already started dating. Meanwhile my mom is suffering from depression and seeing a therapist every week. 

Long story short my dad wants my sister and I to meet his boyfriend. He had plans for us all to go to dinner tomorrow. I asked my mom what she thought but she wanted to leave it up to us and not force us to hate my dad or whatever. My sister and I talked and decided we absolutely don’t want to have this meeting. 

I decided I should be the one to tell my dad. I could tell his feelings were hurt. I feel bad for him on the one hand but on the other hand I don’t.  In my mind, he’s been lying to all of us for years and now our family is broken. I still love my dad and everything but our relationship probably won’t be the same- at least for a while.

For several complicated reasons, she is only in contact with about 7 of her relatives (I use this term extremely loosely here), and one has already refused to attend the wedding. The rest of her family is dead or estranged. She has friends, but including them and the bridal party, her side only has 16 people MAXIMUM. I've asked her if she knows of any relatives who may put aside old angers to come to a wedding or if she wants to invite coworkers, but she doesn't. I've trimmed my groomsmen so that the wedding party matches and we'd have more people sitting on her side, but I don't know what else to do.

One of my friends “Mary” supported me while I wrote the book. I told her about the book and she  helped me with ideas, complimented the parts I showed her, stuff like that. I really saw her as my rock. 

A few days ago, I sent Mary a document with the whole book. It’s about 250 pages, not particularly long. A week later, I messaged her to ask how she was liking it. She said she finished and loved it. As I was talking to her about it I realized it sounded like she didn’t read anything more than the first 25-50 pages or so. I asked her some questions, her knowledge was incomplete and some things she just got plain wrong. When I asked her if she had even read it, she said no. I asked why she lied, and she said, “It’s not really my thing. I didn’t know how to tell you.” She apologized and said she’d read it. I said, “no need, I know where we stand now” and I blocked her. 

The book feels almost ruined for me now. Every time I look at it, and think about how Mary lied to me about enjoying it. Everything nice she said is cruel in retrospect. One thing I can’t fathom is that she couldn’t even slog her way through the whole thing. She just read a few pages and called it quits. I don’t see that as being a friend. I know it takes time to read a book, but I’m not asking her to read Moby Dick or anything. Friends do that for friends.

My brother (28) just got back from deployment. For several years he has done his best to keep his distance from our family and not talked to any of us. 

Two days ago he turns up on my doorstep with his bags. Our mother passed a few years ago, my father a year before that, and no one heard from him during any of that. 

So he’s on my doorstep being happy and pretending he is just stopping in. Talking as if it hadn’t been nearly a decade. 
Then he tells me the place he was going to stay at fell through and he has no where to go. 

Now.. I live in a two bedroom apartment. With my husband and two 5 year olds. We don’t have enough room for another person - let alone someone I don’t even really know anymore. 

I ask him if he needs money for a cab, or for me to check with some friends of mine to see if they can take on a renter. 
At the mention of him paying rent he loses his shit. He starts raising his voice and tensing his arms. My husband  stood up defensively (understandably in my opinion). At which point my brother started to look like he was about to start a fight. 
My husband used to be a police officer and he warned my brother to calm down or get out. 
After some yelling and some firm intimidation from my husband, my brother left, slamming the door on his way out, yelling about how I’ve never been a good sister. 

So here I am. I feel bad. But I feel stupid for feeling bad. Like. He verbally assaulted my husband and I, in my house, with my kids in the next room, after we offered to help. 
But a part of me is saying... he might have been in combat. He might not be seeing things right. I don’t know what he has gone through in the military in the last 8 or so years. 

TL;DR 
My estranged brother got back from deployment and wanted a place to stay. We haven’t got the space but I offered to help find him somewhere. He got very angry and we kicked him out immediately. Now he likely doesn’t have anywhere to go at all. I feel bad.

1,"AITA for calling our friend by a name my bf doesn’t like? | My boyfriend and I (also male)have a “friend” (we’ll call him Dave). I use “friend” in quotations because our relationship is very strange. 

Backstory: Bf and I have been together for 7 years. Dave got my bf a job, and is now getting him a job to work directly with Dave. Great, that’s a pay raise and my bf seems really excited about this job.

So my bf and I always thought Dave was a very attractive man, and would talk about him  casually (that’s a great part about being in a gay relationship). One night while we were out drinking, we ran into Dave. Here’s the first issue: I went home because I knew I had enough to drink. My bf decided to stay out (he’s an adult, I trust him nbd). The next morning when I woke up, my bf told me that Dave was gay. My bf went back to Dave’s place (we had done so a couple times before) but this time he put the moves on my bf. Bf was shocked and said he casually and quickly left.

After some talks, my bf, Dave, and i decide to just go for it. We fooled around a couple times, everything was very casual. But I noticed that Dave seemed to prefer my bf. I get it, I’m used to it. I’m not a huge guy but I am bigger than my bf, and Dave told me he preferred skinny guys (my bf is skinny). This caused me a lot of self-doubt and I decided I was done with this whole mess.

After talking to my bf about this, he agreed that everything needed to “cool down,” yet we would still find ourselves back at Dave’s despite me not wanting to. This whole relationship was causing a lot of stress on mine and my bf’s relationship. 

My bf started going to Dave’s house after work by himself (not often, maybe once or twice a week) I was very uncomfortable with this, as my bf has had some infidelity issues in the past. He insisted it was no big deal. I offered to just join them, I’ll just play a game on my phone while they talk or whatever, but he was insistent on the fact that they had to be alone. Weird, right?

After some sleuthing, I did discover that some things were going on behind my back. Nothing too crazy, but a lot of emotional cheating and a little physical cheating as well. 

Obviously this didn’t go over well. I was ready to end things with my bf. After talking, we agreed to work it out. He agreed to focus on our relationship more and focus less on Dave. Great! But he still goes to Dave’s house once a week by himself. He says it’s all work talk but and insists nothing else is going on. I’m trusting him on that.

So... Anytime bf goes over to Dave’s house or I see his texting him I’ll refer to Dave as “Mister Mistress.” I do it as a joke to make me feel better and try to be lighthearted about everything.

I love Amy and i consider her to be one of my closest friends but she can be quite difficult. Amy's biggest problem is communication. She never outright says what she wants or how she feels and leaves ""hints"" for people to figure out what's going on with her.

For example if Amy wants to hang out she'll text how bored she is, then how lonely and so on. She basically hints at what she wants but doesn't say it out loud and leaves it up to me to figure out what she wants and then ask her, like in my example, if she wants to hang out. Sometimes that gets very frustrating.

Yesterday i met up with Amy and i shortly mentioned that me and my three friends are planning on going on vacation again. Amy then hinted the entire evening that she wants to come with us, even tough she doesn't like my friends.

Some of her hints were ""that vacation sounds like so much fun but i don't have anyone to go on vacation with"" and ""wow i have always wanted to go Greece but i probably won't go anytime soon"" and hints like that. It was hard not asking her because the only nice answer to those questions would be if i asked her if she wanted to come along.

A little back story:

She's a student right now and works part time but barely makes enough to pay her rent/school fees.

I'm 24 and work a minimum wage + commission job, I have barely any money saved so she doesn't understand why I spend so much money/time with family 

We've been dating 3 years with no problems except for this, we love each other and live independent lives but she worries that I'm too focused on helping my family and making them happy instead of building a future for us. She's working as much as she can to pay her bills but because shes a student and also doing her required interning she can't work much more. She doesnt ever ask me for money to help her right now because she wants me to save up.

She doesn't have a family like mine so she doesn't understand, my family is close and I really want to take care of them. She says that I'm supposed to be worrying about my own future right now. She says that she doesn't understand because my mom recently received about ~100k for a settlement and bought a house and a new car and I shouldn't be worrying about helping when they seem fine.

She is angry that I dont take my life seriously, I've been trying to get my real estate license for a few months now but cant find the time to study because of how demanding my family is, they get really angry/sad when I'm not around for family events and I understand why, we're a close family. I get where shes coming from but I cant drop my family. I told her all of this and she got angry saying that shes not asking me to abandon my family, she just wants to make sure we have a solid foundation before we worry about helping my family. And I cant build a future if I'm always with them.

She expects me to start saving up money for a downpayment on a house while she finishes and gets her degree and can start helping as well but I keep telling her my family needs me first. 

We had a particularly heated fight, the worst we've ever had last night and she said she feels like I'll never care enough about my future and I'm supposed to be building one for myself and her and she can't be with someone like that. She said if I really feel like helping my family comes before my own future than that is my choice but she's going to have no choice but to worry about herself from now on and plan a future where shes her only priority because I make it sound like I don't want to be part of it. 

Shes stopped mentioning anything about it and is now talking about saving up for a one bedroom apartment and a car for herself (she lives in a basement). She seems so sad but I cant help but feel like shes wrong for even asking me to not help my family. 

I dont know if I'm being an asshole or not for telling her that my family will always come first.

However, despite getting a lot of interest from girls, even hot girls, I didn't sleep with any of them, even though they wanted to sleep with me.

Yesterday, I met up with some guys and girls (friends) and they kept probing as to why I didn't do anything with any girls, I flat out said:

""I hope no offense is taken, but I'd never sleep with a girl from this hometown. I hate this place and can't wait to get out. My story doesn't really begin here"".

He pretty much raised me when my dad couldn't, (he got arrested and imprisoned in Columbia for some bullshit drug charges for a few years before the incompetent legal system realized he was innocent). My uncle rarely took things seriously which is what i loved about him. He took me to strip clubs when i was 15, took me on a road trip to sketchy places across eastern europe when i was 17. Together we hitchhiked across Chile and Argentina when i was 18. We went to wild parties near home too. I had the courage to ask out my girlfriend (now engaged) because he pretty much forced me to start talking to a rally hot girl that walked across us in the bar. If you guys ever played the Uncharted game series, my uncle is basically Sully. He looks similar and his voice is similar  and his personality is too. My uncle was one of the greatest people I've ever met. I have so many good memories with him. He even joked about how his funeral should be a party and that we all should get completely wasted. He believed funerals shouldn't be so sad and gloomy, celebrate the life the dead lived not grieve over them being gone, be glad they existed. He even jokingly said that if he were to die soon (obviously he was hoping to live longer than this) he said he'd want me to propose to my gf during his funeral. I started dating her because of him and i should take it to the next step in honor with him. I honestly thought this was a fucking hilarious idea but also a way of commerotaing him so i told him i'd do it if he were to die before we were married. Unfortunately he died a month ago from a stroke that was completely unexpected and i was devastated. I tried to get my family to throw a party in his honor as he requested but nobody wanted to do it no matter how much i tried so i decided to propose to my girlfriend during his funeral. My girlfriend knew my uncle for 5 years and saw him as a father figure as well ( she didn't have one and we both started dating when we were 16) and although she didn't have prior knowledge of my proposal, she wasn't shocked by it and thought it was cute.

SO the day of the funeral comes and we all speak kind words about him. They save me to make the last speech and i go on for probably 20 minutes about how much he meant to me. At the end i said, ""in honor of my uncle, I'm proposing to my girlfriend, I had the courage to ask her out because of him and now I'm proposing to her in his honor as he requested.""

1,"AITA for helping my sister secretly replace her husband’s wardrobe while he was out of town? | Asking here because it’s blown up in my family and my husband is also really mad at me for being a part of it.

So I have a twin sister (26 both of us) and we live only 20 min apart. She recently got married to her boyfriend of 4 years. 

Two weekends ago she asked me to go over to help with a “project” she had in mind. I get there and find that my sis basically bought a TON of new clothes for her new husband. Some background, my new BIL has a really good, professional office job in tech but dresses atrociously. Like honestly so bad people have definitely taken pictures of him in public. His go-to look outside of work is like cut off jorts, sleeveless tees, or raggedy sweatshirts with holes in them. He’s also incredibly protective of this “look” because he doesn’t see anything wrong despite being a 30 year old fully grown man. My sis has had countless fights over this, since he dresses like this to family outings and completely embarrassed her in front of our entire extended family. He absolutely refuses to compromise on this so far.

Anyways...we’re standing over piles of new clothes and she asks me to put them up in his closet and remove the trash he has in there, mostly the REALLY raggedy clothes with literal holes. We leave a few tshirts and shorts but most get packed up in her trunk to be thrown away. This goes fine and we’re pretty proud of our work, since he now has brand new clothes that’s actually 1) fitted and 2) looks good on him and proper for his age. 

So, the nightmare begins like 3 days later when he gets home and finds a brand new wardrobe. Instead of actually looking at the clothes or being the tiniest bit grateful of his wife’s work, he loses his absolute mind and rages at her. She’s crying and stays with us and my husband is also mad at us, saying we crossed lines. Now we’re here nearly two weeks later and it’s no better. My husband is mad at me for helping her and my sis and her husband is still not talking.

Originally they said they were going to get married on a local beach which was fine and I accepted being best man because he really is one of my longest best friends. 

&#x200B;

All of the sudden they've decided they're going to do a destination wedding in Moscow Russia. I told him that I think that's awesome and i'll make sure to send a gift and that he better make sure he takes pictures because I can't wait to see. He said ""what so you're not going?"" I told him i'm sorry but that I won't go to moscow. I've never left the country, don't have a passport and have a deathly fear of flying, for reference I live in michigan and the couple time's I've been to Florida even though the rest of my family flies I'll drive (besides road trips are fun right?). 

  
He's now upset saying that I'm not supporting him, I told him the rule with destination weddings is always that you have to be prepared that not everyone's going to be able to go. He's now upset because not only am I not going, none of his friends are going his stepson isn't able to go because the bio dad (who we've had issues with in the past but I understand his reasoning for this) won't sign off on his son going to Russia, basically only his parent's will go. Now some of them don't have the money, I seem to be the only one just scared of leaving the country, and the rest just don't want to go to Russia (because like.... who wants to go to russia?). He's saying we're not supportive of his wishes, which I disagree with he chose a destination wedding which automatically means a lot of people can't go, and he chose a really weird destination, which a lot of our friend group is LGBTQ and russia's known for not being friendly to that group. But my family is saying because of how long we've been friends I should get over my fear and go support him.

This is not a shotgun wedding. They do not plan to have kids for the foreseeable future (if ever.)

They intend to have a proper wedding in the future, when finances allow. However, in the meantime, she's forbidden me from mentioning it to anyone in our family or even friends of mine who know her,  but do not know the family.

These are kids who never had an apartment and want us (the parents) to give them what they need to get started. It's a financial imposition to ask us to furnish their house, and I know that both my family and the groom's family would be delighted to help if they could. 

In addition, the groom's family all knows this is going to happen and I feel our family will be terribly hurt if they are shut out completely. We're not inviting people to the courthouse,  obviously,  but they can call and offer their Congratulations anyway. I'm worried that, when they finally do have their wedding,  nobody will want to come because they weren't even given the dignity of a notice. 

Further,  I  make lots of crafts and baked goods. I like to post the projects on social media for critiques and she's forbidden me from posting the wedding cake picture. Her real wedding will have a professional cake,  but I wanted the practice, around just a few of us will be there. Frankly, my enthusiasm for helping her is dwindling and I am contemplating *not* baking the cake, as literally this exposure was all I wanted. 

I'm also thinking of offering her less for setting up house. My original thinking was,  they could save up faster if they don't have to buy furniture and dishes. But she won't let us enlist the help of others. We have to replace what we give her and do without in the meantime, because we don't have money to buy these things right now.  We're willing to do this for their comfort. It sure would be nice to see if anyone else is planning on getting rid of some old furniture or dishes so they can get started.

I have three children: a 27F who lives overseas, 26F daughter Amy and 16M son Terrence. Recently, Amy got engaged and she and her fiance decided to host a small engagement party with just our two families. The celebration was just going to be a brunch at a dress-up place and taking some pictures nearby. Honestly, it sounded like a normal casual family gathering and nothing out of the ordinary.

Amy initially told me it was going to be at 9am and that it would likely end around 11am. Now, Terrence is an amazing baseball player. He's part of the city's Triple A team and he's the only one who can (properly) play his position, so his attendance was very crucial to the team's victory. Terrence had a baseball game at noon, so I thought we could go to Amy's thing, leave a bit early and get to his game by noon (it was about an one hour drive away).

A few days later, Amy texted my wife and I asking if 3pm was okay. There were some relatives coming from out of town the night before and 3pm was the next available slot. We told her OK (my wife is not involved in Terrence's baseball games so she didn't know he had a game that day). My plan was to go with Terrence to his game, leave a bit early, change in the car and get to the party at 3pm. Terrence was on board with this plan as well.

The day comes and my wife asks why Terrence and I were not getting ready at 10. We explain our plan to her and wife calls me an asshole and starts lecturing me. Terrence and I try to explain how important the game is and how he already told his team that he will be there for the first half, but it's all lost to her. We end up leaving anyways and gets an angry call saying that it's a nice place and we can't just show up in sports gear. I assure my wife that I packed clean clothes in the car, but she hangs up on me.

When we get there, I get an angry call from Amy saying that I'm not taking her occassion seriously.

I would sit with her mom on my days off and take her mom to cancer appts. They were heading to pick up her grandma 10 hours away and asked if I can come to help (Plus give her mom her booster shots since F1 hates needles). Last year her mom died of her cancer and I was with F1 and her mom when she was taken off life support. 

This last year I was with her once or twice a week. Helping her cleaning the house, painting, doing the estate, etc. She always said no one else would come help her, she has no friends around us, etc. 

Well she is getting married. She told me I won't be a bridesmaid because she didn't want me to work, but relax at her wedding (honestly don't care about this. It's her wedding) and she's having people she met at comic cons out of state be her bridesmaids. Her cousin who is on the other side of the country, she hardly sees, is her maid of honor because she's married and knows how weddings go. Then she asked me a few days later if I will hold the marriage certificate and help the venue clean up after the ceremony and before the reception. I agreed.

But now F2 and my mom found out and said I shouldnt. That she should've chosen me to be a braidsmaid if not maid of honor  (again I don't care about this, they do). That being married isn't an excuse to choose someone for being maid of honor and reminded me I've been it twice (To F2 and another friend) and that I did good. Said she is taking advantage of me. That I've done so much for her (helped with her mom and grandma, helped her with housework and errands, got her mail when she's gone, been her emotional crutch this last year, etc) and she hasn't done anything for me. I tell them she has gotten me a lot of stuff from comic cons I can't go to because of work but they said that's her choice (because I don't ask her to and she just gets it and gives me them). 

They said after all I've done for her and how I've supported her I should be a bridesmaid at least. That I should just say work refused to give me the day off.

1,"AITA for calling my sister a dumbass for rejecting a handsome and successful guy? | My sister and I are middle classed people. My sister is pretty hot and she’s a decent person, so she gets a lot of male interest. Her relationships don’t last very long. There’s always so much drama. So she’s single now and isn’t actively dating, but isn’t opposed to it if a good opportunity arises. She likes tall, handsome, athletic, white guys. Nearly every one of her past boyfriends fit that mould. 


So she told me last night that she got hit on by an NBA player during her girl’s night out last weekend. She told me who. I don’t know him so I had to look it up. He plays for our home team. It looks like he doesn’t play much since he’s a rookie, but he’s on an NBA team nonetheless. She told me that although that guy is tall, handsome, athletic, and white, she didn’t like his arrogant vibe and that he seemed like a jerk. She said she doesn’t like jerks, but two of her past boyfriends were total jerks. 


I told my sister that she’s a dumbass for rejecting such a successful guy without giving him a chance for a date at least to see if they really vibe or not. She said that she could tell he’s the type to break women’s hearts when they let him in. I asked her how she knew. She said she just knew. I called her a dumbass again for thinking she knows everything. 


I also told her that the NBA just got cancelled, so she’ll have plenty of time with that guy if she wasn’t so dismissive. She said she doesn’t give a shit because she didn’t like the vibe he gave off. I told her that she’ll regret it in a few days.

She was a family friend, and pretty much watched me and my brothers grow up. When we were late teens/early 20s, my parents split up because of his affair. Obviously this had a lot of nasty and long-lasting repercussions for my family.

That being said, they got married when I was 24.

Further complicating things is the fact that my dad has a degenerative disease, and will probably pass well before she does. She is his caretaker, and I am very grateful for that. For the past 10 years, the length of their marriage, I have always been polite and pleasant, participating in family activities with them, all that good stuff. Never have I been disrespectful. Things are pleasant.

In fact, her mother recently passed, and she referred to me as her daughter multiple times, told me she loved me, and spoke about how she and my father have been working for “10 years to make this a family.“

This caused me to reflect. I don’t want to be her friend. In fact, once my dad passes, I don’t want to have any relationship with her. I’m simply not interested. Too much hurt and pain and history. If I didn’t know her through my dad, she’s not the type of person I would be friends with anyway.

0,"AITA for encouraging my BF to pursue his business idea? Now he's dead broke. | Roughly a year and a half ago my (24F) boyfriend Xavier (29M) expressed interest in quitting his full time job and starting up his own business. We have seperate finances and we plan to keep it that way. I have no stake in his financial success (or lack thereof). 

From the get go Xavier's family were not supportive of his business idea. They didn't believe his business could directly compete against 2 already established local businesses in the area and they strongly discouraged him from quitting his job. 

Xavier was crushed by his family's reaction. He turned to me for support and (naively) I gave it to him. I strongly encouraged him to pursue his dreams. I told him he was clever,  hard working, dedicated and perserverent and he could achieve anything he set his mind to. I encouraged Xavier to live his life without regrets and rise up to the challenge. Basically a lot of motivational crap talk that in hindsight seems stupid now. 

 At the time,  I genuinely believed Xavier had a decent chance of succeeding because he has a brilliant work ethic and a brilliant mind. However,  I knew there was also a good chance he would fail and lose money but I assumed Xavier knew the risks. 

Flash forward to today and Xavier's family were right - Xavier's business turned out to be a complete flop. There aren't enough clients for the business to be sustainable and he can't compete against the local competition. Xavier's in massive debt (he put all of his savings into the business and also took out a massive business loan) and he's been forced to close the business because he cannot keep it in operation without pouring more money into it. Now Xavier's currently looking for a full time job to replace the job he once had. He's also had to move back in with his parents because he can't afford rent or bills right now. 

Although the choice was ultimately Xavier's,  I am recieving all the blame from Xavier's family for steering him in the wrong direction. They believe he would have never quit his job if it wasn't for me. His Father believes I fed him false hope and pretty much ruined his life. His Mother sent me a ridiculously long  message saying  I was happy to let Xavier crash and burn because our finances are seperate and if I really loved him I would have looked out more for his financial security. 

Xavier doesn't blame me at all and our relationship is still strong despite what his family thinks.

1,"AITA for telling my sister she can't date my ex-husband? | My twin sister and I (both 24F) have been friends with one of our neighbors (23M) since birth. Growing up, we did everything together. He and my sister had feelings for each other throughout our teenage years, and dated for almost a year when we were 16. After they broke up, we all kept on being best friends. They never had hard feelings about their break-up. However, my sister did admit to me about two years later that she was still in love with him.

For his 21st birthday, the three of us went out to celebrate. About half-way through the night, my sister decided to go home with this random guy, leaving me and him alone. We danced and drank and hung out for a few more hours, and all night there was this weird tension in the air. We ended up spending the night together. It was totally unexpected but amazing. Like, suddenly I saw my friend in a totally new light. 

We felt kinda bad about it since he and my sister used to date, but we figured it had been a while since their break-up so it shouldn't matter. That said, we decided to put off telling her about our new relationship until there was something to tell. We had a lust-crazed, wild month together before deciding we were totally in love. Then, he asked me to marry him. It was impromptu but also felt really right in the moment. We got married three days later, without telling anyone, including my sister. 

We revealed that we'd gotten married a week later, which came as a shock to most people who knew us, since they didn't know we were together. I talked to my sister about it, and she said congrats, though honestly she didn't seem that happy. 

Unfortunately, the marriage didn't last long. The ""crazy in love"" feeling faded quickly, and we were separated within two months. We both realized that we'd made a mistake, and that we weren't right for each other. Ultimately, I consider our brief relationship a funny blip in the story of my life, a moment of ""what was I thinking?"" However, the three of us have all maintained our friendship since then, with our short marriage something of a joke between us. 

Last week, however, my sister called me. She said that she and he had been flirting for a few months now, and that they'd like to give a real relationship another shot. She said that she'd really always been at least a little in love with him, and that she hoped I would give her my blessing to pursue this.

I said no. I think it's entirely inappropriate for her to even ask, honestly. That's my ex-husband! What kind of sister wants to date her sister's ex-husband? 

She said that I was being cruel, and prioritizing a three-month relationship over her feelings (feelings which she claims she's held her whole life, though I think that's BS, or she would have said something when we got married). She says she'd have liked my blessing, but is going to date him with or without my support.

1,"WIBTA for asking my boyfriend to tone down his style a bit to fit in with my friends? | I [21f] started dating this guy [24m] approximately four months ago.

So about my boyfriend. He is a ""greaser"". Like, he really thinks he is a bona fire, 1950's greaser. His style is usually black t shirts with a leather or jean jacket with a popped collar. He's got a pair of goggles he wears when riding his motorcycle that are dangling around his neck like 99% of the time. He greases his hair straight back and tends to talk with outdated slang. And he works as a mechanic at a sort of classic car dealership in town. So he is like all-in on thinking he is a ""greaser"". It's maybe a little weird to me, but kind of charming in a way, and he is a super great guy so I'm happy to put up with a little eccentricity on his part.

A couple months ago I was having a small get together at my apartment and I figured it would be a good way for him to meet my friends since we were starting to get serious enough for that.

He and my friends got along fine, but my friends also kind of thought he was a weirdo. Shortly after he left my best friend asked 
me ""So, uh, does he think he is Fonzie or something?"" And I admitted that yeah he does a little bit.

It's become a little bit of an inside joke among my friends now. They'll ask me about ""Fonzie"" and joke about going to a sock hop or the drag strip. I have one guy friend who keeps calling him a ""power"" which is kind of annoying.

I don't think they mean anything by it and my boyfriend seems kind of blissfully unaware of people joking at his minor expense. 

I've kind of been thinking that *maybe* I should try and ask him to update his style an it? Just to fit in a little better without being made fun of by people. I don't want to fundamentally change him, just get him to maybe drop the outdated slang and try dressing a little more modern?

But, it is his style and he seems to care about it quite a bit, would it make me an asshole to try and get him to fit in better? Maybe I should just let him live his ""greaser"" life?

0,"WIBTA if I didn't give my cousin the money from her graduation gift | I bought my little cousin a very nice and very generous piece of jewelry for her high school graduation a few weeks ago. Our grandmother recently passed away, and had given me, as well as my sisters, the same item (a watch) for our high school graduations. So in my grandma's absence I gave her the watch, a simple and classic style Movado that set me back \~$500USD. It was significantly more than I have ever spent on a gift, but felt that this was an important occasion and this tradition was important in my family. 

&#x200B;

About a week ago I'm checking my online banking, and I notice a chargeback on my card from the store for the full amount of the deposit (I financed the watch and would be making payments). Thinking it was a mistake, I called them and asked to speak to the manager. Wellll..... It turns out my cousin came in the very next day and returned the watch. The manager also added that the greeting card I had given with it was still in the bag and my cousin had left it behind asking if we wanted that back.

&#x200B;

I felt so hurt. I didn't even know what to say. I felt hurt that she couldn't be honest with me about how she felt, I felt hurt she clearly didn't value my generosity, I felt hurt that she returned the item the next day.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday: My aunt calls me up. She explains that my cousin had returned the watch as she felt uncomfortable with how much I had spent on her, and felt that she had no need for such a nice piece on jewelry in college. I said I was hurt but that I understood. My aunt proceeded to say that, however, she has a lot of things she needs like new clothes and dorm stuff and she could really use the money. She proceeds to say that she's talked to my cousin and it would be great if I could just Venmo her all of the money I spent on the watch.

&#x200B;

I was so floored. If I had wanted to give her a cash gift I would have, but the only reason I spent that much money is because my sisters and I have all gotten that same watch from our Grandma and I didn't want her to feel hurt or left out. I thought it would be a nice surprise, but it was a lot for me and I had financed it, and it would be really financially uncomfortable for me to cough up such a large amount of money in one month. I let her know this.

&#x200B;

I told all of that to my Aunt, and she proceeds to call me an Indian Giver and say that's disgusting, that I can't just not give my cousin a gift because she didn't want the watch, that I was ridiculous to give such an expensive piece of jewelry to a teenager, and that I should be proud of her for being responsible enough to want to spend the money on things that are more practical for her in this stage of her life.

Izzy is honestly really pretty. When people see Izzy or think about Izzy they for sure think she is incredibly attractive. Like insanely attractive. All through high school almost every guy in our class would constantly ask me to set them up and talk to her for them and just stupid shit like that. Also I guess a lot of girls were jealous of Izzy because she basically only had me and a few other guy friends and one girl friend. She never was interested in any of the guys at our high school and honestly I always thought she knew she was too attractive for them. 

So we are off to college now. We have talked about her sleeping with a few guys but when she shows me pictures I can see they are all incredibly attractive like her.

I’m in my 50s and my wife of over 20 years have no children. We do enjoy kids and play the fun aunt and uncle to my brother and sisters kids. my siblings kids are younger. There’s 5 of them total ages ranging from 13-4. I love them like they are my kids and my wife and I spend a lot of time with them. We also are pretty well off financially, so we love taking them to theme parks, downtown (our major city), and our vacation house.

At the end of 2017, my brother started to go through a very rough divorce, cheating involved. The kids have been very depressed and it sucks seeing the two of them carted around between their mom and dad. This year, I got a pretty nice bonus and decided my wife and I are going to take our brothers 2 kids and our sisters 3 kids to Disney World for a week. I’m pretty excited as I am a Disney nerd myself. And the younger kids haven’t gone before so being there with them for their first time is an incredible feeling.

At the end of 2018, my brother has been dating again, and ended up finding someone he feels seriously about. They moved in together this past November. I’ve met her and she’s fine, she seems a little quiet for my brother but he seems happy and over the divorce so It’s all good. She has a 7 year old daughter who moved in with my brother as well. He actually spends more time with the daughter of his girlfriend than his kids, since she spends all week there (dad not really In the picture) and his kids go there on the weekends. She is a sweet girl, but I have only been around her for more than just a hello probably twice. Apparently his oldest (the 13 year old) is annoyed with her, but she gets along really well with his youngest.

I brought up the Disney vacation with my brother and sister and they are ecstatic. I extended the invites to them but neither of them are big on theme park vacations. So my brother asked me if I planned on taking (girlfriends daughter). I said honestly I was not planning on it. I explained that an extra child of that age would be too much for my wife and I to handle. And that his kids are still struggling with the separation, and having the child of their fathers new girlfriend on the trip might not be the best.

He told me that it’s my money and he knows his kids will have fun so I can do what I want. But he thinks that I’m being an asshole. Because “I can afford it” and “we need to get to know her”. I snapped that he’s acting like this is his wife and I know the child. I said this is a woman he has known for a little over a year and a kid that has lived with him for a few months.

We haven’t talked since, my wife is saying that we should just take the daughter to avoid a problem with my brother. I do not want to.

She was constantly on my case for missing class and staying up late because she made it her personal mission to ""fix"" my life even though my life is already pretty fine and I'm happy with the kind of student I am.

There were a lot of other little things that bothered me like some boundary issues and annoying habits that she had. The thing is that Gray isn't a bad person, she just gets on my nerves so I kept my distance as much as possible.

At the end of the semester people started looking for new roommates and a lot of my friends came up to me to ask me what living with Gray was like and I was honest and told them about all the little things that she does that bothered me, personally. They all took my word and by the end Gray was desperate because no one would room with her anymore.

Like in my mind I'm just saving them the trouble of getting to know her before the crazy pops out but now I'm thinking that maybe it's none of my business what my friends think of her and I need to just keep my mouth shut.

If this helps at all I know a lot of other people that also can't stand her, so I'm inclined to believe that I'm not just making the whole thing up in my mind,she's actually annoying.

1,"AITA for refusing to kick a drunk guy out of my house after he supposedly harassed a girl? | I threw a party at my place Friday night. My girlfriend had one of her long time friends “Kim” in the city visiting and I invited a bunch of my guy friends while my girlfriend and her friend had a bunch of their friends over. 

The night was a lot of fun until at one point one of my best friends “Pete” was super wasted when we were out clubbing. By this point I had told Pete that he could stay at my house because he was too drunk and I wanted to make sure he would be safe. Kim had also been staying at our house for the past few days at that point. 

When we get home, my girlfriend pulls me aside and tells me that Kim told her that while we were out at the club, Pete was acting super aggressive towards her, attempted to grab her a few times while we were dancing, even after she turned him down. She said that at one point he attempted to stop her from leaving the bathroom by putting his arm up but she pushed him off and walked away. I didn’t see any of this, let me make that clear. My girlfriend told me that Kim didnt want Pete to stay the night at our place because she “doesn’t feel safe” with him there. 

I told my girlfriend that I didn’t want to kick Pete out because I didn’t see anything that happened and he was drunk and just being an idiot and if I kicked him out I wasn’t at all confident that he would make it home in one piece. 

She told me that I was prioritizing my friend and his behaviour over the comfort and safety of Kim. I said that wasn’t the case but because I didn’t see what or if anything happened that I wasn’t going to kick a super drunk guy out in the middle of the night and nothing was going to happen that night. She got pissed at me and told me to sleep on the floor in the living room. 

In the morning, Pete left early before any of us were awake as he had to make a drive to his parents house so I didn’t get to talk to him. When my girlfriend woke up she was still pissed at me and said that I should’ve listened to her and that I’m “part of the problem.” 

I brought up again that I didn’t want to just kick out a drunk guy in the middle of the night but she wouldn’t listen to me and her and Kim spent most of yesterday and today out of the house.

1,"AITA for not stopping my band's show because my girlfriend got caught in the moshpit? | Am using a throwaway though I'm not sure why because the second she sees this, she'll know it's about her. 

Last Saturday my <23M>'s band was playing a gig at a bar. My GF <21F> just turned 21 in November, and this was her first chance to see us play outside of practice. I play bass and sing. We are a punk metal band. There were three bands playing, and we went on in the middle. Also, me and GF drove up together which ended up being a BIG MISTAKE. 

She doesn't like my kind of music, but she was being supportive. The crowd wasn't very heavy but it was heavier than usual for this venue, so about 20-30 people during the first band. She's already complaining about being bored when the first band was playing and wanted to know why we got there so early. It's pretty much a thing to support the other bands when you're all playing. I told her we'd have to stay until after the third band and she was already in a bad mood. The crowd was not very rowdy during the first band.

Our time to play came on and we set up. As we were setting up about 10 more people showed up, mostly there to see the last band who is more popular than us, so by now the place is getting way more crowded than usual. 

We go on, and she's right in the middle of the floor arms crossed watching us. Which I thought was pretty cool at first because she was there supporting us even though she was in a bad mood and didn't really want to be there. BUT

Our third song is really fast and heavy, and the crowd started circling. She didn't understand/realize/comprehend what was happening. I waved at her to move out of the way, and she did the Baby Yoda uncomprehending wave back. The crowd started running into each other and moshing. 

Now, you gotta realize being in a band this is the ultimate rush and it was the first time this really happened for us so everybody was into it. But my GF didn't know WTF was going on, and instead of getting TF out of there she started pinging around like a damn ball in a pinball machine. I think the guys in the pit thought she was into it so they started smacking into her. 

She ends up going down in the pit, and another dude trips over her and lands on her hard. I can see she's crying and screaming. The pit stops and some other girls pull her out. She's bleeding from her arm and goes to the bar, and I can see she's bleeding. She's pointing at her arm, screaming. I can't hear shit. 

We play the next song, and she storms out. She ubers home and calls me like 15 times over the next 20 minutes of our set (We only play for like 35 minutes). i get off the stage to find a bunch of missed calls and texts. 

She is full on RAGE PISSED I didn't immediately stop the song and save her from the mosh pit. I didn't warn her. (I honestly didn't think it would happen).

Tonight my dad and I got into a huge fight. Huge. I (24F) and my mom (47F) have not gotten her disability pay and it’s a week late because of a problem at the bank and social security. Mainly because my mom still has his last name on her social security stuff because social security didn’t accept her name change when they got divorced. Her license has her maiden name because our state accepted the name change from the divorce. The bank has her last name as her maiden name and keeps refusing her paycheck cuz the names don’t match up. She’s trying to get her social security change to her maiden name but it’s taking a while. 


I accidentally messaged him about a problem that was supposed to go to a friend and it started the whole fight. He wants my mom arrested for fraud, he wants me arrested for aiding and abetting. It was a whole huge fight and I finally snapped at him and told him to stop bashing my mom and calling her lazy and stuff and stop bashing her to me because he’s so blinded by his hate for her. 


My dad straight up admitted that he was betting on me failing in life because I love my mother. He can’t love me like my other siblings because I look just like my mom. He was being a horrible person. So I finally told him to never speak to me and I blocked his phone number and his Facebook. 


I want to pay the $200 to get my last name changed to my moms last name. I don’t want to be associated with him anymore. He’s been emotionally abusive to me my whole life cuz I’m close to my mom. This is the straw that broke the camels back tonight and I no longer want to be his daughter. 


My brothers are saying I’m overreacting and I’m an asshole for wanting to change my last name because they think it means I don’t want to be their siblings anymore.

I've been with my wife (31F) for 6 years now.

Usually during her ""time of the month"" she spends 4 out of 7 days in bed because, I'm going off what she says, they're so painful it leaves her unable to do anything even with painkillers - she doesnt always take painkillers and tries to get through the pain as she puts it.

We had begun to think she was pregnant since despite being frequent she hadnt had her time of the month for 2 months after her last one being  10 days, she was considering going to the doctors but has decided it isnt an emergency.

She promised the children as soon as the paddling pool arrived, on the day we would put it up and she would spend all day outside with ALL of the children since we have been busy.

Paddling pool arrived today and so did her time of the month early last night.

As usual shes in bed.

Children have been begging to play outside, with her.

I asked her if she wanted painkillers and when she is getting up, she said she didnt and isnt.

Day progressed and children got more and more whiny and she refused to deal with it while I was in a meeting.

I may have snapped when I got a small break, I told her to either explain or take a painkiller and stop feeling so d-mn sorry for herself.

She got all teary eyed and basically screamed at me that I'm an insensitive ass, got up and played with them for the day (extremely annoyed and snappy though, not towards the children)

so yeah. I've been dating this girl for six months. I met her during winter semester, and immediately fell for how insanely cute she was. I always felt like I had to have my guard up because a lot of guys would always hit on her or ask for her number. She was suddenly on her phone a lot, ignoring me, whatever. She went ""shopping"" a lot. I was watching over her shoulder one day and I saw that my brother's name popped up on her screen. My stomach started to churn. I've been cheated on before, I know the warning signs. There is \*absolutely no reason she needs to be talking to my brother\*. If she needs to talk to him, she can talk to him through me. That's what I thought at the time anyways. I tried to go through her phone, but I didn't know the password and I didn't want to disable it because then she would have known that I was on to her. 

I tried to catch her in her lies, she wouldn't give me straight answers about where she was going, and I had enough. I confronted her yesterday. I waited for her to be done with classes, and I told her that she needed to come over immediately. I told her I knew about her and my brother. Immediately she looked guilty. I'll admit, I was pissed, and lost control. I started yelling at her, I did call her a slut for messing around with my brother, and I told her that we were done. Then she started to cry, asking me what I was talking about. I told her that I saw my brothers name on her phone. She took her phone out, unlocked it, pulled up her texts between her and my brother. They were planning a surprise party for me at my grandparent's house, this Saturday night. I got even angrier because that didn't make sense to me. How could a surprise birthday party be more important that me? What I mean is, why did she go to such an extent and make me think she was cheating on me? Of course I would think she was cheating on me. If some guy saw his girlfriend texting his brother behind his back and not telling him where she was going, I think that any rational man would think that she was fooling around. And the texts also don't explain why she couldn't just tell me where she was really going.

My husband and I are choosing baby names. We both have Scottish and Irish heritage -- several family members either having an anglicized version of a Scottish/Irish first name or surname. 

We are strongly considering giving our child a Gaelic name. Our top three contenders if it's a girl are Saoirse, Ealasaid, and Marsaili. Two of the boys names we like are less difficult for an English speaker to pronounce -- Eamon and Seòras -- but the other one, Eoghan, might confuse some people. 

I DO strongly believe we should give them an English-friendly middle name, think Ealasaid Rose (we haven't gotten that far yet lol), so that they have another name to fall back on if they need it. Husband is on board with this.

My MIL and my sister, however, think that this would be horribly cruel even with the middle name thing and insist we HAVE TO give them a ""normal"" first name -- Elizabeth instead of Ealasaid, for example. Neither me nor my husband like the way Elizabeth sounds (nor any of its diminutives), and the same goes for Sarah instead of Saoirse and Marjory instead of Marsaili (Marge just makes me think of the Simpsons). The same goes for the boy's names.

MIL has gone so far as to say she will call them by the English equivalent and will make Husband's younger siblings do the same. I told her that's a one-way ticket to No Visits Town, which she handled as well as you'd imagine.

As it happens to be, Rohan fits this stereotype to a tee: he dresses like a generic fuckboy, listens to Travis Scott 24/7, only talks to white girls, makes jokes about Indian culture, plays tennis, and aspires to go to UVA so he can join a frat and go to Wall Street afterwards.

She has a son of 18 months, Theo, and another baby on the way, she says by the same man. I have my doubts. Alice works in a call centre, and says she's management. I also doubt this. Alice is also living with her half-sister from my late husband's first marriage, and she is pushing me away, allowing her half-sister to replace me.

Sarah, (half-sister), is much older than Alice. My husband was a bit older than me, and I am only a few years older than Sarah.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Growing up, Alice and Sarah didn't have much contact. Sarah distanced herself from my husband, and refused to be a part of his life. She didn't even meet Alice until she was a teenager. Alice has always fancied herself a martyr, and I have always been her favourite target for this. She makes up elaborate stories about her childhood, designed to make me look like a bad person.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Alice left home at 18. I always offered her a place in the family home, but she always refused, rudely. I recently found out that she is now living with Sarah and Sarah's husband, and is acting like they are her parents! She won't let me see Theo, but she is always rubbing it in my face how well Theo and Sarah get on. She posted a picture to facebook of Sarah and Theo with the caption ""Theo and Yera (rhymes with Sarah)"", which is far too close to a ""granny"" nickname for me. Sarah is NOT Theo's grandmother. I am. It will confuse him, and that's not fair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've tried speaking to Alice about it, but she is unreasonable. She just says that I wasn't much of a mother to her, and that Sarah is more supportive. She also threw it in my face that I don't get to see either of my eldest son's children, either. My son and I get along wonderfully, but the mothers of his children are odd, unpleasant girls, and won't let me have contact with my grandchildren unless I jump through their ridiculous hoops, which I refuse to do.

I told Alice that she was being ridiculous, and that she needs to grow up and treat me with respect, and come home immediately. I told Sarah that she was being immature as always, and that her past problems with me don't entitle her to drive a wedge between me and my daughter. Sarah just ignored me, but Alice became even more dramatic, and started putting even more pictures of Theo and Sarah on social media, which hurt me terribly.

So I have to ask, am I in the wrong? I am hurting so badly, and Alice doesn't seem to care. She can't seem to see that Sarah doesn't want her to be happy, she just wants me to be unhappy, and she doesn't notice that it's working.",False,False,4,3,5,4,2,3,Loyalty

I asked M out before but she turned me down. I was overweight and had confidence issues then, and that lead to me getting angry at her. We didn’t talk for a time, I missed our friendship and regretted reacting the way I did. C helped me by becoming the bridge between me and M. M and I eventually started talking again. 

Since then I have gone to the gym, lost weight and gained confidence. I also got closer to M, we talk almost every day about almost everything. She gets me special gifts on my birthdays and always encourages me to continue being healthier (I still have a bit to lose to get to my target weight). I wanted to ask her out again, but I was waiting for the right time. I just needed a sign to assure me that she’s ready to be more than friends. 

Since last year I’ve noticed that she and C have been talking a lot. They have inside jokes in our group chat with our other friends, tell each other things that they don’t tell the rest of us, they don’t cancel lunch or dinner plans if I and our other friends can’t make it, they just go by themselves. I figured their newfound closeness is because they bonded over a new game that they both play. M and I still talked every day, and C and I still talked and he never said anything whenever I mentioned wanting to ask M out again. 

So I was shocked and felt very betrayed when C suddenly asked if he could date M. Turns out the week before, they met up for midnight fast food and when he drove her home they looked at each other and ended up kissing. M told him that they shouldn’t have done that but she wasn’t angry, she just said we’re friends, it’s fine, let’s not talk about it again. C has been thinking of her ever since and he thinks he has feelings for her and wants to tell her. I told him that he’s a backstabber and that from now on we are no longer friends. 

I told my friend R what happened and asked how best to let the rest of our friends know. He consoled me but said it was not right to get angry at C because M is not on object that I can ‘reserve’.

Anyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. 

So when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up.

We got along pretty well with that guy and played together until 2015, but never met in real life. Since then we didn't keep much touch to him(We talk on a whatsapp group like twice a year and that's it).

As we got older and life happened that real life group kinda broke up due to some fights. Also people on that group started working, going to college, relationships, etc. So we don't really hang out together anymore. 

Yesterday, on Christmas Eve, that guy was drunk and messaged us on that whatsapp group. He said that he wanted to come visit us and asked for a place to stay. No one offered a place for him, since everybody in that group still lives with their parents(that's quite common in my country) and they wouldn't be ok hosting a total stranger, but he still bought the plane tickets anyway without any agreement on our part. He said he would be coming next month to stay for a week.

 It took literally 30 mins from telling us that he wanted to come and buying the tickets. The thing is we don't have a place for him to stay and no one would be able to spend the whole week with him due to work, college and other obligations. It's a small city so he basically wouldn't have anything to do here by himself.

WIBTA for telling him that he should cancel his tickets(here in my country law allows you to cancel and get a full refund up to a week after you bought it) since the group of people that he would come to visit doesn't get along that well anymore and there isn't even a place for him to stay?

So a bit of background information: I’ve been playing DnD with the same group of people, more or less, for about a year. In that time, 4 of us have been there, but others have come and gone, each with a brief mentioning (something like, hey, Greg wants to play, I think he’s gonna come play with us next week). There has never been a culture of asking for permission before inviting someone or getting the okay from other group members. 

I haven’t invited many people because I’m a pretty introverted person and thus don’t have a lot of exposure to people outside my friend group. But I was talking to a coworker about DnD, and he was interested in playing with us. So I took his phone number and added him to a new group chat with the rest of the group.

1,"AITA for telling people that my GF and I have been together for 1 year if she thinks it’s 6 years? | For reference my GF and I technically dated our last year of HS and all 4 years of college. However, last year when choosing grad schools the one that was the best for my research interests that was realistic for entry and I had already been accepted to was 3 states away. My GF and I had a big argument about it and she was angry that I was choosing to move so far away and broke up with me during the argument. We ended up cooling down and agreeing to try long distance and got back together during the same argument. It ended up not mattering because I actually got accepted to a closer school that was much better but I thought was basically a lottery ticket for me.

We both thought that we were together for 6 years until now, but I realize that’s not actually true. I recently read a philosophy book about the vagueness of language and how we mostly just use inexact descriptions of things and that any true clarity is impossible using human language, but that we should still strive for precision whenever possible. I thought that was interesting and now I realize it’s not exactly true to say that my GF and I have been together for 6 years. If someone asked you how long is your string is you wouldn’t say that it was 6 inches if you had a 1 inch piece of string and a 5 inch piece of string. They’re two different things. If someone wanted to know the sum of the lengths of your string, they’d ask that. But the actual question, as well as someone asking for the length of your relationship, implies continuous measurement, not a discrete sum. 

My GF vehemently disagrees with that. She says that it’s pedantic, disrespectful to our relationship by minimizing it, and actually communicates less than I think it does since she feels the need to correct me every time I say it. I pointed out that she doesn’t need to correct me and that I always tell people that we dated for a couple of years before a break then got back together if they ask. She says that one and half hours during an argument isn’t a break and that it’s stupid to frame it that way. I think that she’s in the wrong, as the way she frames it fails to communicate vital information, and she’s been framing it as if my side is silly.

0,"WIBTA If I didn't let my homeless mom live with me? | So I (18F) am also homeless but I am currently living at a shelter, whereas my mom (55F) couch surfs daily. We used to live at the shelter together (we moved in when I was 17 so she was still my guardian) but I turned 18 while here and she got kicked out on multiple occasions for staying out past curfew due to drug use and now she's not allowed back in, at least for a while. This is not the first time I have been homeless under her guardianship.

But I am now an adult, and there is a housing program that I am in for homeless youths that will pay my rent for 8 months or so which will allow me to save up and get a job in that time so I can pay the rent once the allotted time is up. They just need to find a place that meets the program guidelines, and recently my case worker told me she found one that would be perfect and that if I wanted, my mom could stay with me. But I'm not sure I want her to.

First of all, it's an efficiency/studio, so it's one room we'd have to share: and my mother is not an easy person to share a room with. She'd also essentially be living rent free, riding off of my opportunity, while she most likely spends her disability money on drugs. I also don't trust the people she hangs out with; she doubles as a dealer and in the last 3 months I've had people actively seeking me out because she owed them money and even threatening to hurt me (can't put the actual details because this sub doesn't allow talk of that stuff). I've thought about maybe having her give me her money so I could budget it and make sure she doesn't spend it on bad stuff, and also only letting her stay if she was sober, but this is not an easy job, plus she is very manipulative/I'm a pushover. I also don't think I'd have it in me to kick her out if I found out she relapsed either.

That being said, she's my mom and while she hasn't been the best to me, I love her even though I don't like her and I don't think it's fair of me to leave her out on the streets/in the houses of fellow drug users. I feel like no matter where she's living she's going to use anyway, so she might as well be somewhere safe. She hasn't done the greatest job taking care of me, but I can't deny her good moments either. I know that's a mom's job/the bare minimum she was required to do, but still I feel like I owe something. I also must admit that I will barely be there because I spend 90% of my time with my boyfriend. I basically live at his house, but not fully because I can't (he lives with his parents and I need my own space to come back to as an introvert), so I would rarely be present to deal with any problems she may cause.

So would I be the asshole, given all this, if I didn't let her live with me?

Our daughter is a beautiful girl, and I always felt like my husband’s salary couldn’t give her what she deserved in life. We live in an apartment on top of a former mill instead of a house, and when she struggles at school or with her mental health we can’t afford more than momentary help. 

Our daughter was scouted by an agent that had excellent references plus a great track record. She got signed to a modeling agency and I would drive all the way from Rhode Island to NYC to take her to castings and jobs. 

My husband began fighting me on the time away from home, but he couldn’t see how she shone. She was such a star in front of the camera. 

People tell you to pursue the things you’re good at, so why can’t my daughter do that? My husband said she needed to be a bookworm- but she has been getting Cs in school, so why not make something else besides an academic track job where she might be outshone by peers her profession? 

We all want the best for our children, and what I want to do is set her up for an illustrious life. Since she’s been modeling she’s been around rich men and has been gifted designer clothes. Her agent says she needs to move to NYC full time and I agree that she needs to focus on what she loves. 

My husband said he’d consider divorce that if I tried to move her to NYC. But even my daughter said that she didn’t need anything that school was now teaching her, and in any case we spoke with a program that would help her pass the GED test. She can also learn a lot from the gentlemen she now has the ability to meet which I think she can’t get anywhere else. 

Now that I think of it, I believe my husband is jealous of the life she’ll be able to live or the rich men make him feel less of a provider? The way he sees it, he wants her to finish high school and be in college, but by the time she’s finished with college, the people in the industry would have forgotten about her.

When I told my wife, she was pissed. She said she couldn't believe I didn't at least discuss it with her first, rather than just telling her I'm leaving. But that was because it was a split second decision, plus we have a 5 month old that we can't exactly bring with us and she just started a new job, so she can't really just leave for two weeks.


She suggested we wait and go together later on, and just go for a couple days, but we still would have to find something to do with the baby, and she'd have to find time off work, and we'd have to afford a 2nd plane ticket, and I really wanted to stay at least 2 weeks to spend time with family and have time to myself to recover from the plane trip before I meet up with them.

He does however facetime them fairly often and seems to do fine with that. His parents also offered to let us ride with them when they visit, which he also turned down.

It was a traumatic birth, our second was a fussy baby, and we had two kids under two. When I found out my husband had an affair, it absolutely destroyed me. 

Things only got worse after S was born. Her mother passed away when she was just a year old, leaving my husband and I with full custody of her.

S made a kind of snippy remark about how it was funny that I'd told her I couldn't take off work for one of her school sports events, even though she'd asked me to since her father couldn't either, but I could go to L's no problem. I told her I couldn't, because I was genuinely busy around that time, but I'd have to be there for L's event. 

S starts off on yelling at me, saying that I don't care about her, and we ended up getting into another argument.

Prue had issues with current friends. Drama. But my tolerance for that was low—that's when I noticed she brewed drama herself, saying things like ""..but I introduced them"",""they were my friends first""..

Fast forward to me living with Prue. SO came to visit (staying in the home). Prue comes home and finds he made dinner for her and me. She mistakes this act as exploiting her hospitality. She saw a ""mess in my kitchen"". A fight ensues and that's when I learn Prue has a silent loathing for my SO.

Two notes:

1. S.O. and Prue are in the same field. S.O. is more accomplished. This may play a role.
2. SO became good friends with ""Xiu"" from Prue's circle. Prue has a rocky relationship with her. 

3mos after the dinner debacle, things aired out but I'm still stuck in the middle. Prue invites college friends to dinner. I go to bed early 'cause I'm not a big drinker. SO and the rest stay up. Next day, Prue says SO is conceited, ""he thinks he knows more than I do"". etc. This repeats, now Prue and SO can't be in the same room.

Note S.O. is as confused as me. He's sweet, loud, but not mean. He finds the situation sad, like losing a mentor.

Prue calls a meeting realizing our relationship is dicey. She makes SO cry. I state the absurdity of adults dealing with this. It works for a year.

Prue learns Xiu and SO's friendship has grown. She imagines gossip passing between them. I become acquaintances with Xiu too. During dinner with Prue I say I go to game night with Xiu's partner. Now Prue turns on me.

""Oh so Xiu and you all.. you've been getting together without me?"" 

She has no idea Xiu isn't involved, but I don't correct her.

1mo later, I see Prue at an event. I say ""Hi, how's it goin?"" No response. Not a look. Later, in an email thread started by Prue's friends, she sends S.O. a new message:

""Hi SO! How about you be yourself and fuck everything up like you always do!"" I semi-ghost her. 

**Last night**: SO attends a party for Xiu. Prue attends. I don't go. Then, like clockwork, this text:

1,"AITA for gifting my boyfriend a couples cooking class for his birthday when he doesn’t cook? | Keepin it short.

So my bf recently celebrated his 30th bday. I got him 2 hour long cooking classes that we will both attend together. They’re like “romantic cooking classes” where each lesson you learn to make something romantic and tasty, like chocolate cake or macarons.

My bf doesn’t cook much (beyond fried rice or tacos) and isn’t normally bothered by fancy foods but I’m a huge baker enthusiast so thought this would be a nice way to share my hobby with him. Honestly I thought this would be a neat gift but he wasn’t that excited by it. He was just like “oh thanks” and after I pressed him he admitted that my present seemed more like a gift to me than one for him.

1,"AITA for ""insulting"" my brother's girlfriend over a Christmas present? | I brought my family Alexas for Christmas. One for mum and dad, which I helped them set up, one for my sister, who loves hers, and one for my brother. I texted him about it a week or so after and he responded that he loved it. Went to his place today and I realised I couldn't see Alexa anywhere. He then got weird on me, and I straight up asked him if he'd even taken it out of the box. He said he hadn't. I asked why and he said his girlfriend (who he lives with) said she didn't like it, so he never set it up.

His girlfriend is fucking weird. She's basically a conspiracy theorist. She has actual paper maps and if we're ever all out together and don't know where we're going she will find the nearest info point/public map or ask someone and refuses to use maps on her phone, not that she could look it up on her phone anyway, because she still uses a flip phone with no wifi! I figured it was a money thing so when I got an upgrade I offered her my old iphone and she said no thanks because *she doesn't trust them*. A few months ago there was a burglary a few blocks away from them and when I suggested they get an electric lock she said she didn't want one. She even has those plastic slidey things over her webcam so even when the camera is off she has black plastic obstructing the view! The weirdest part - SHE WORKS IN IT! Computers are literally her job and all her tech is from 20 years ago!

I got annoyed, because I really thought my brother would like this gift I gave him, and I asked why her not liking it meant he couldn't use it, and he said it's because he'd be setting it up in a common area. I said she could just not use it but then he admitted she'd shown him these articles about why they shouldn't have one. I asked him to show me and they're all weird clickbaity articles. I told him his girlfriend was paranoid and he was just as bad for going along with it, and next thing I know I'm getting a bollocking over ""insulting"" his girlfriend.

When I got home I saw a message from my brother. He says if I'm going to ""throw a tantrum every time you come over"" then I can come pick it up but he didn't want it and he didn't want me ""insulting"" his girlfriend again. I send a screenshot to our sister asking her if she could talk to him and she admitted she'd also stopped using her one and packed it up, and she says I need to be the one to fix this,.

I really don't see how I could possibly be TA here. This probably counts as a validation post tbh because I don't get where I've fucked up here but now it's 2 v 1 and I figured I should at least check.

He kept saying he would ask her out when the time is right and didn’t need my help. Time went by and Ash continued to mention his crush on my sister until our first year of uni, when he met a girl he would later date for 2 years. We graduated and are making the big bucks now. Ash hasn’t been on many dates since his breakup. My sister got out of a 3 year relationship 4 months ago. Thus Ash began mentioning his crush on my sister again. I think they would be compatible from the physical, socioeconomic, and personality standpoints, and I don’t mind my sister dating my friend. I asked Ash if he would like my help, but he said he would rather wait until he feels ready to ask her out himself. But my sister just started dating again. I told Ash that to try to make him more assertive. He’s timid when it comes to women. It’s been 2 weeks since pushing him to make a move, but still nothing. Thus I thought it was best to help him out. 


I asked my sister 3 days ago how her dates are going. She said she’s still trying out with different guys. I asked her if she would consider dating younger guys. She said she prefers guys around the same age. I asked her how low could she possibly go. She said 2 years younger is the minimum. I said that’s perfect because Ash is 1 year and 9 months younger and single. My sister asked me why I’m recommending Ash. I talked him up by praising his looks, job, and personality. My sister asked me if Ash asked me to be his wingman. I tried to dodge the question by asking her what she thinks of Ash. She said he’s alright and told me to tell her the truth. I confessed that Ash kept telling me he had a crush on her and wanted to ask her out himself, but he would get too nervous so I’m helping him get the word out. I didn’t mention his crush on her started in middle school because waiting that long and not making a move is a bad look. She said she was open to trying a date with him even though it’s a little weird he’s my friend. I said that’s awesome and would let Ash know. 


I met Ash today and told him about my interaction with my sister and her receptiveness. He flipped out and said I made it incredibly awkward. He said he made a New Year’s resolution to be more assertive and ask her out himself on Thursday, but now my sister knows he’s a wimp. I told him I didn’t believe he would change his passive ways and said he should be thankful for me setting them up. Ash said he would ask out my sister, but he feels the chance of them starting on the right note is slim now because he won’t seem like a real man to her anymore.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 4 months now, and about a month ago met his whole family including his brother and wife. It came up in conversation that his brother is a huge fan of a certain small band that I just happen to know the guitarist from. 

This past weekend my bf told me that his brother and wife wanted to go for a night out with us, I thought this was a great idea! So they got a babysitter and we made plans to meet at a local bar for Saturday night. 

I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to show off a little bit and gain some brownie points with his family, so I called up my guitarist friend and asked him to meet us at the bar that night as a surprise. 

Well, the night came and we arrived at the bar, got a big booth table with his brother and wife and were off to a great start to the night. After about an hour my friend showed up and I invited him over to our table to meet everyone. He chatted with us for about 30 minutes before going to sit at the bar for the rest of the night. It seemed like bfs brother was impressed and I thought I did well by going above and beyond. I thought wrong. 

When we got home that night my bf immediately blew up at me asking why I had invited another guy along to an outing with his family. I explained what I was doing and who it was but he was having none of it. He kept saying how I was supposed to use this night to get to know his family and instead I spent the “entire time” talking to a different guy right in front of them. 

I do admit that I did stop to chat with my friend another few times, maybe for 10-15 minutes each at the most, but only when it was my turn to get a round of drinks. It’s not like he sat at our table all night or I was getting up just to go talk to him.

They're a married couple and while he's close to both of them, the wife is probably his best friend. They're very close. I can't STAND her. He and I have been together nearly four years and I've met her three times. She is insufferable. She's a theater type who can't stand to have any attention \*not\* on her, talks endlessly about herself and over other people when they're speaking. The first time we went out was on NYE 2016; the whole night she kept making sure I didn't forget she'd known my boyfriend longer than I had and just generally made no attempt to make me feel like I mattered. So whenever my boyfriend wants to hang with them, I give him my blessing (I'm not so petty that I'd say, ""you can't be friends with this person"". But I have made it clear that I never want to spend extra time with her and will only tolerate her when it's absolutely necessary).

He said last night he was heading to NYC on Friday, 2/28 to spend the weekend with these friends. I was like, ""Have fun, you can tell Don\* I said hi but only Don."" He rolled his eyes but he's used to me by now.

This morning he tells me that he and Don were talking last night after I went to bed and they decided to try and get tickets to see Saturday Night Live because John Mulaney is hosting and David Byrne is performing. He told me this all super excited and I froze.

You see, I am huge fan of both Mulaney and Byrne. I've been a Talking Heads fan since childhood, and in summer of 2018 I took my boyfriend to see David Byrne on his American Utopia tour. Our mutual love of Talking Heads/David Byrne has been a solid foundation of our relationship. And I am a MUCH bigger fan of Mulaney than my boyfriend. We've seen him perform live together. So my boyfriend KNOWS how much I love these guys and it felt like a slap in the face.

So I was like, ""Well that sounds like a whole bunch of fun without me."" He asked if I was upset, and I said, ""Yeah a little bit."" And he kind of hinted that if I didn't hate his other friend so much maybe I could be part of it and I doubled down on my dislike (""Yep, my hatred of Missy\* is stronger than my love of John and David, she's totally awful""), but I know myself and that was purely a defense mechanism. I said he didn't have to announce to me that he was going off to have fun seeing two of my favorite celebs and then expect me to be all celebratory for him. He sighed but looked genuinely sad that I was reacting so badly. And that's where we left it.

I feel like a jerk. I know he's allowed have a good time without me. He also deserves something good since he's had some recent disappointments. It just felt so pointed that they were going to do something so tailor-made for my enjoyment.

0,"AITA for rejecting my moms dying wish to see me before she passes away? | Here is the background of the situation, me and my mom never had a good relationship to start off. Around the age of 14, my mom and dad had a nasty divorce that ultimately split the family in half. I have 4 sisters, 2 older and 2 younger and I am the only son. My sisters left with my mom and I decided to stay with my dad. 

The reason I decided to stay with my father was because one night he came into my room just crying. Telling me he has no one else left in this world except me. That night I promised to be by his side no matter what and always be there for him. I can see that my mom hated me for choosing to stay with my father. 

Skip a few years later and I’m 17 and living with my father still. Over the years my father slowly started drinking his pain away and it took a toll on him and me. He became an abusive father telling me that I remind him of “Her” which is my mom but I stayed because I loved my dad and I promised to be with him no matter what.

I tried to keep in touch with my sisters however my mom hated that idea. I felt like my mom brainwashed my sisters to hate me for choosing my dad over her but I didn’t care. I tried to talk to my sisters over the phone, drive to their place and hang out with them because they were still my family. Except one day I went over to my moms house to see my sisters and my mom, however she pulled me aside privately telling me its best to stay away from them because I would bring my dads influence and I won’t be a good role model to my younger sisters. She told me that she doesn’t want to see me around ever and to stop hanging around my sisters and that broke my heart. 

A year later I turned 18, and things just got worse, my dad became more angrier with the world and I was scared everyday locking my room, sometimes I’ll just spend nights in my car just to get away because I was afraid of what he becomes when he drinks. One day I just couldn’t take it anymore, I decided to pack my things and just leave because I don’t have a family anymore. I asked one my online video game buddy who lived 4 states away from me, if he would take a stranger into his home. He told me that I am family and he welcomed me into his family. 

The day I decided to leave I told my dad that I’m leaving and I’m never coming back. The look he gave me, I could tell his soul just dropped out of his body. He just looked dead. I packed what little I had and went into my car. Lastly, I went to my moms house and she was there alone and my younger siblings were at school. I told her that I’m leaving and I’m not coming back to this f#cked up family. That day she asked me if I finally got tired of my dads shit and just told me to she doesn’t want to see me either. I just felt disgusted and just depressed. I tried to a be a son to my mother and father, I tried to be a brother but I just couldn’t do it anymore.  That day I left to my friends home driving 21 hours straight, just crying. I arrived at my friends house and a week later I get a call from my uncle that my father committed suicide. I was devastated and blamed myself for his death because I promised to never leave his side.

Years later I’m 23, it’s been 5 years and not once I received a call from my mom or my sisters about my whereabouts or how I’m doing.  They didn’t bother come looking for me, nothing. Except one day my younger sister found me on social media and texted me through Facebook. She told me mom had developed pancreatic cancer and doesn’t have much time left. I kept in contact with my younger sister because I still gave a damn about my family deep inside me. I would text her about how everyone is doing, especially how was mom doing. We exchange numbers and we would call each other here and there. 

One day I get a call from my younger sister and it happens to be my own mother. She tells me that she isn’t doing so good, she doesn’t know how much time she has left and apologizes for being a bad mother towards me. She told me she wishes she could see me one last time before she passes away and in that moment, what she said just destroyed me. I responded by telling her No, I won’t come see you and that this is what she wanted and I just hung up the phone.  Days later i get a call from my younger sister telling me that mom passed away and was crying a lot and I’m an asshole for not being there for my own mom, I told her that she doesn’t understand what I’ve been put through and I haven’t talked to my younger sister ever since then. 

TL: DR: My mom’s dying wish was for me to come see her before she passes away, I told her no because of our past differences and my younger sisters tells me I’m an asshole and haven’t spoke to me since.

So I need to work out over winter break but I don’t want to spend >$30 for a gym membership for just a few weeks. So, I ask Lucas if I can borrow his family’s gym key until I go back to school. For some reason, he said no. I thought he was messing with me so I asked again, and he said no again with a more serious expression. I asked why, and he said “just because” and I pried more and he said his mom needed the key to go to the gym (but his mom told me before that she goes to a chain gym close by) so I was confused AF. I was like ok I can just ask your little sister for the key whenever I need to use the gym, and he said how his sister is never home.

So the next day I was going to workout and I decided to try his house and ask either his parents or sister for the key without telling Lucas (**as my reasoning is that the key belongs to his family, not my friend as his parents own the house**) and when I asked his mom to borrow the key for the day, she offered to let me borrow the key for the rest of the time I’m home for break!

Many people join us for soccer or playing board games but not many of them are interested in studying religion. I think that if someone plays soccer with us, they should join us for other things as well, as part of the group.

There was one freshman who called me out. I thought he was way out of his limits. He joined me to play FIFA one night, and then stopped answering my texts. I keep asking him to join our faith meetings but he just ignores. Since he doesn't tell me to stop, I keep messaging him and asking him to join, because if he does pick up an interest I don't want him to skip anything. Same applies to the other people I message. I believe that God loves all His children, even the ones who don't care or believe in Him. I want them to at least join us for one session of Bible study. But they don't. Even worse, they have started ignoring even the invites to do other fun things.

Back to that freshman. I messaged him about a large group meeting we had planned to discuss Christianity as well as do other stuff like talk about college experience. He finally responded, but it wasn't what I had hoped. He was like ""Stop messaging me, I am not interested in any of this.

0,"AITA for not letting my dad see his grandchildren? | Apologies for the length of this.

I've always had a good relationship with my parents, and when I told them my gf was pregnant with my daughter 2 years ago, they were overjoyed. When my daughter was born, my dad looked at her like I've never seen him look at anyone. He was completely besotted.

Cut to three months later and my mum is diagnosed with cancer. It's a big thing, but we stay strong and we work through it.

A month after this, my mum finds out that my dad has been cheating on her. She came home one day and he was sat on the sofa covered in love bites. He wanted to be caught clearly, easier than having the hard conversation. Not only that, but he started cheating on her a week after she was diagnosed with cancer. He was actively looking - we found his online dating profile listing him as 'single', created a week after the diagnosis. He has decided to do this when my mum needed him the most, and then spent all of his time with this new woman, refusing to take my mum for her chemo or help around the house. He used the house like a hotel, stopping for food and sleep before he went back out with her.

Once he'd been caught he announced that this woman was the love of his life, and that he was excited to start his new life with his new family (she has two daughters). My sister was understandably angry as he's never really shown her much affection.

Since then he's become this horrible person, telling people that my mum was 'overexaggerating' the cancer for attention, and more. We also found out that he'd been using prostitutes for a number of years, and that he'd been fired from several jobs for stealing when he told us he'd moved jobs of his own volition.

I immediately decided to cut him out of my life. I dont want that kind of person around my children. I have a son now too, who will never meet my dad as long as I have any say over it.

Two years later and I havent spoken to him once, but certain family members (including my sister) have started talking to him again and seem to be slowly letting him back into their lives. Even my mum seems to be softening up over it. I will never forgive him for what he did to my family.

And i used to have a lot of fights against other students and teachers for saying pro-terrorist stuff. I live in turkey btw just to clear things up. So around 5 years ago in my class there was a girl in my class that would go to meetings of some terrorist groups because she supported their cause.
Well i would get mad at this but since this did not affect me that much i never cared too much to say anything about it since she never confronted me about my ideals.

Her last words i heard was that she was going to a meeting with her family to support their cause.
Well the next days on the news i sae that there was an attack on the meeting site and that some people had died. Well those days that kind of stuff would happen very often in turkey so it was not surprising that it would have happened in a meeting. 
After the weekend the whole class was aware of that she died and stood silent in a means to grief for her. 
Well i wasn't having none of that and spook out during the lunch break that she was supporting an illegal party that would use every means possible to get what they want. So i told that she knew what was coming her way and that she deserved it since she supported them.

There are some things she wants for the wedding that we are not doing to stay within our budget and she’s not too happy about that but she understands the situation.

What she doesn’t know is that I have an extra $20K savings in a joint bank account with my best friend Mia. We set that account up years ago when we started working, I always ran out of money from impulsive buying so Mia suggested we get a joint bank account where we both need to sign for withdrawals, so we can't take money out of the account for impulse buys. We put in a fixed amount of money every payday and now we have $40K in that account. It’s separate from our own individual savings, which Cara knows about.

I don’t know what I’ll do with the $20K but right now it just feels good to know that I have that money available if I ever need it. Mia and I haven’t talked about what we’ll do with the account of when we’ll get our money out, we both just want to keep putting money in there for now.

If I tell Cara about the money, I know she’ll want to use it to have the things she wants that we are doing without in the wedding. But personally I think that we’re spending enough money already and we can do without more flowers or better decors. I’d rather save the money for things we’ll need in the future like when we buy our own house or have kids, so I don’t want to tell her about the $20K.

I explain to him that everthing is safe, and reinstall it. He does the same thing, and i get a call a week later. I go back, but this time i hide the application in the chrome store, and i buried malwarebytes in his windows directory, and lastly take away his administrator privileges.

1,"AITA for being honest in how I felt about my teammate? | So I \[35M\] have been playing a coed sport with the same group of people for almost 6 years. About 4 years ago, a new girl, “Tori,” \[27F\] joined our team. She’s a good athlete and she fit in well with the group, so pretty soon she was also being invited to social events with the team. Over the past few years she’s gotten really close to some of the women on the team, including one of my best friends, Jenna \[29F\], and started dating another guy on the team, Alex.  

Here’s the thing – I really dislike Tori. Something about her just rubs me the wrong way. She’s pretty good-looking and I get the impression that she knows it – I feel like she thinks she’s better than everyone. But everyone else seems to really like her so for the most part I kept these thoughts to myself. I see her 2-3 times a week, so I just made my peace with it and was always nice to her because I didn’t want any drama.  

A few months ago, I matched on Tinder with a girl in Tori’s grad school program, “Cat.” We went on a date and Cat mentioned that she’d seen that we had a mutual friend, Tori. I asked Cat what she thought of Tori and Cat was like “she’s great, I really like her, why do you ask?” I told Cat, basically, that I really dislike Tori and that she seems like kind of a bitch. I generally consider myself an honest person and I was just really tired of pretending to like Tori. 

Things fizzled out with Cat and I honestly forgot about that conversation. So last weekend I showed up to our sports game and said hi to everyone. I noticed that Tori didn’t respond super enthusiastically (she was like “oh, hey…”) so I asked her what was up and she said “nothing.” I hate it when people are obviously lying to me so I asked her what her deal was. She finally looked at me and said “Cat told me that you massively shit talked me on your date. I thought you were my friend and I’m honestly pretty upset, so I’d appreciate if you could just leave me alone.” She said this in front of the entire team and her tone was really aggressive and bitchy. I was pretty pissed and said something like “sorry, but Cat asked me what I thought and I was just being honest about my feelings.” 

Since then everyone on the team has been telling me that I’m a huge asshole and are basically telling me that I should apologize to Tori or consider taking a break from the team. I’m surprised because (1) I’ve been on the team for longer, and (2) Tori didn’t need to call me out like that in front of the whole team.

Our small group has been very close for 7 or 8 years because none of us really grew up with supportive families.

Our group is very candid with each other so after a couple months of this strange change in behavior, us reaching out, asking if he was alright, we were frank and said it felt like he was making himself pretty distant. He appreciated our feedback and told us he'd make more of an effort to participate, and at least respond to us to let us know what's up and if he's okay.

After that he would only ever really respond to us when it was about some kind of mundane topic. Others in our group would share incredibly personal parts of their lives and he was noticeably absent, but someone sends a message about a new movie coming out and he'll chip in a message or two. It's not like we were going to force him to participate, the situation just ultimately created a strange tension that has caused us all to drift a bit apart.

One day he finally agreed to meet up with us and he announced he had split up with his longtime girlfriend and had already been dating someone else for a few weeks.

**Relevant background:**

I (28F) and my twin older brothers (33M) grew up poor. My dad worked in a warehouse and my mom worked a part-time job as an orderly at a psych hospital. Really rough, minimum-wage jobs. However my siblings and I never felt poor. Our parents always made sure we had food, a roof over our heads, they got us into good schools and into after-school enrichment programs for free through sheer will power. They networked, begged, volunteered, whatever to give us a good upbringing. And it all worked out great for us: we all got full scholarships to top colleges and did well for ourselves. I am a software engineer, my brothers are a civil engineer and cardiologist respectively. Since we all make good money (150k+), we decided 4 years ago to each put money into an account (1k/month/person) and gift it to our parents next year when they celebrate 35 years of marriage. They can use the money to retire and fulfill their life-long wish to buy an RV and travel the US. We plan to continue contributing to the account for as long as our parents live.

**The AITA situation:**

Last year I got engaged to my boyfriend of 3 years and we are getting married this summer. Recently we decided to merge our finances before our wedding. This makes most sense since i make roughly 5x what my fiance makes. When we were going over my accounts, he saw the 1k recurring charge and I told him that money is going into my parents' account monthly (he knew about this but didn't know how much). He thought i was joking and i was going to stop when we got married, I said no, that money is going to my parents. He totally flipped, he accused me of putting my parents before him and that he could use that money instead to complete his college degree. I told him i was more than happy to use our joint finances for his college degree but we would have to cut back on some things (like getting a new car, nice vacations, etc). This turned into a big fight which ended in him saying that we need to see a therapist to resolve my ""unhealthy"" attachment to my parents. I sad no and he stormed off saying I'm a big AH.

I thought this wouldn't be an issue: my parents did a lot for me and they are getting older so I would like to repay them while I still can.

We still have infrequent communications by text/phone call, and whenever we do meet, it’s as though no time has passed – we catch each other up on life, commiserate about shitty things going on, and reminisce about old times (a healthy, functioning adult friendship, in my opinion). 

The past 12 months at work had been intense, I was travelling interstate for weeks and months at a time and was hardly ever in my home city. I saw my friend twice during that period (once for her birthday where I dropped in for dinner and had to leave early to attend another event, and again for my birthday where we had a one-on-one catch up).  I am now back in my home city, and life has returned to its normal pace.

About a month ago (June) I realised my friend hadn’t responded to my calls and text messages for about two months (April/May). It put it down to life being busy, but just to be sure I sent a text message and left a voice message along the lines of: “Not sure if you’re getting my calls/texts, but I haven’t heard from you in a while. I don’t want to seem neurotic, but are we cool?”. 

I expected a tongue in check response, but I was served a proper essay about being an absent friend, being generally selfish, and not making the time, and, because of that, she “needed a break” from me. She cited my leaving early from her last birthday as a major issue. It took the wind out of my sails. This was one of my oldest friends. I tried to call back as soon as I read the message, but the phone rang out. 

I sent back a pretty defensive text message asking her why she left it so long without saying anything, and apologising. It was angry in tone, I guess. I got nothing back.

Recently, 2 of her friends (who were married to each other) had a freak accident happen where the husband crashed his car, was hospitalized, and they pulled the plug on him. The wife took it hard (understandably) and yesterday my gf went to her place to help out with the chaos happening.

The 2 friends had a son together, I believe he's 4ish? 5ish? I got a text today from my gf saying she wants us as a couple to be there for the mom and kid, and my gf and her friend want me to be a role model towards the kid.

I hate kids. I really do. I told my gf when we first started dating that I don't really like kids and don't plan on having any.  And I don't have a problem with the mom, but I barely know her. My gf doesn't hang out with them much because they live almost an hour away. Besides all that, I'll be the first to admit I am NOT role model material. My mom sucked and my dad wasn't really around much to be a role model.

I told my gf that the best I could do right now is say I'd think about it. But that's totally to buy my ass some time to tell her no. Because I don't need that responsibility on my plate. I'm literally going to propose to my gf tomorrow so we have to plan on the wedding, I'm in the process of starting a new job (today was day 3) which is stressful work and I'm not sure it's a good fit for me, which is adding to my financial stress because I don't know if I'll stay with the new job or not.

1,"AITA for making conversation with a girl my girlfriend hates? | My friends and I (10 people, just to give an idea of the size) get all together every once in a while to just hang out and have a good time. One of my closer friends in the group has a girlfriend that mine hates to the bone. We'll call her Lisa.

Lisa has done some pretty questionable shit to my girlfriend. She's a nice person overall but has stuck her nose in some of my girlfriend's relationships too deep and has done some damage. I'll spare the details, but I am fully on my girlfriend's side in this. We can't totally cut her off though since she's the girlfriend of one of the guys.

Anyway, while we're all hanging out, Lisa starts talking to me and we just have a normal conversation. I'm a pretty easy going guy so I ask the usual ""how is everything"", make a few jokes, we show each other some funny memes on our phone, then the rest of the party continues. Lasted like 10 minutes I'd say

My girlfriend the next day starts telling me how upset she was that I ""fed Lisa the attention she craves so much"", and how I shouldn't crack jokes with her and make conversation with her. She said I should just be blunt with her and give the shortest replies possible whenever it's my turn to talk.

I'm here to have fun. I also don't want to disrespect my friend's girlfriend by being a dick to her. To top it off, I don't wanna start any bad vibes in this party just to please my girlfriend. I could probably find a way to do it subtly if we're in a club or something, but we're literally just 10, in a house.

1,"AITA for following my [42M] wife [27F] around for an evening? |   

The title sounds extreme but here are the details. My wife and I have been together for 5 years. I love her so much that it pains me to write this. The thing is, I was the sole earner for a while and I was happy to provide (I am a software developer at a local startup that has tripled in employees and gone exponential in revenue). We're not having kids, so my wife got bored of being home and doing nothing. So she got a job at a law firm as a paralegal. 

Enter this attorney, who I'll call Brandon. My wife started to bring him up quite a bit. You know when your wife starts talking about something, drops it, and then brings it up again a few minutes or hours later like there was no gap? My wife does that with stories about him. I searched through her Facebook friends list one day for ""Brandon"" and saw that they had connected. Okay... Then my wife starts going to work happy hours and I'm seeing pictures of the guy on her timeline. In most of the pictures she is positioned next to him, holding a drink. Okay...

I have gained considerable weight since joining the startup. There is free food provided to us nearly every day. My wife has maintained a really low weight and looks as beautiful as she did at 22. Brandon is more like how I used to be weight wise. However, I believe I make more money than he does.

So here it goes... I take off work on Friday, as my team is nearing the end of our project. I wait for my wife to leave the firm and I see her walking out with Brandon. They get in my wife's car, purchased on my dime, and I follow them for a bit. They go to a local dive bar and it turns out all of her coworkers are there - I see them entering. I wait for hours and everyone eventually leaves. My wife leaves last with Brandon and she takes him home. I don't see any physical contact as he exits the vehicle to go inside his apartment building.

At this point, I'm sick. I'm gutted. I wait at home for my wife and confront her about Brandon. She went insane basically, threatening to end the marriage because I stalked her. She told me she is always the DD for happy hour because she doesn't drink much (which is true), but she didn't address my greater concerns. AITA?

Me and my girlfriend have been together for about a year and a half now, and we have already been on one week long trip together to France earlier this year. It was amazing.

Secondly, I think it's a dick move to cancel such a trip only a few weeks in advance because I know how much my friend is excited for it. Now, I only speak to my friend about once a week via text now because we live very far away now and so can't see each other (another reason why I'm excited), however, we were best friends for 16 years before this.

1,"AITA for not ending my friendship with my best friend after he cheated on my sister? | Both my best friend and my sister know about my other account so this is a throwaway.

I'm an 18 year old guy and I have a twin sister. I've been best friends with my best friend (we'll call him G) since kindergarten, so G and my sister have always been pretty close too. They've kind of had a ""thing"" going on our whole lives. For the longest time, they never officially dated for a bunch of different reasons I won't get into, but they were always really close and really into each other.

A little over a year ago, when we were all 17, they finally started dating. Everything went really well for like 13 months, but then long story short, G cheated on my sister and I was the one who figured it out. He swore it wouldn't happen again and begged me not to tell my sister but I told her anyway. I was mad at him and he was mad at me so we didn't talk for a month and a half, which was honestly the weirdest month and a half of my whole life. G's practically like my brother, we've been inseparable since kindergarten, so not having him around was kinda....unbearable honestly lol

After our streak of not talking to each other, G invited me on his family ski trip as a way to make amends (I've been on lots of his family's ski trips through the years). I accepted and ended up forgiving him and letting him back into my life because it was way too weird without him in it. I can tell he's genuinely sorry about what happened. He literally cried cause he felt so bad and I've only seen him cry like once before in my whole life

Anyway, G and my sister broke up as soon as she found out he cheated and they're still not on speaking terms, so my sister obviously isn't happy about the whole situation. She's making me feel like shit for still being friends with G, and she doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it would be for us to lose our 13 year friendship over her. I know G made a huge mistake, I hate him for it and I'll never 100% get over it, but I'm not gonna let it ruin my best and longest friendship. I think about it like this: if your best friend cheated on their SO and then felt like shit, would you end your friendship with them? No. So why is this any different just because his SO happened to be my sister? G and I are going to the same college in the fall (a different college in a different state than the one my sister's going to), so none of this is gonna be something that we even think about when we're living in different places

0,"Am i the asshole for getting upset that my SO called something my mom bought for me ""disgusting ""? | My mom tried to commit suicide twice last year and I was the first person called to the hospital both times. My mom is an alcoholic and I haven't had the best relationship or upbringing with her but she is still my mother and I love her.

Yesterday I decided to clear out the apartment my SO I have together, he had loads of junk in one of the cupboards,empty boxes and things he doesn't use anymore. However when I was clearing I went through every box to make sure there were no wires or warranty stuff still in the boxes and if it looked important I asked if he wanted to bin or keep. There were a few things he wanted to keep and without question they went back into the closet. 

However about an hour into it (when I was nearly done) my SO started to help and lifted the only thing of mine in the cupboard. A set of outdoor lights my mom had bought for me in the summer, he asked me 3 times if I wanted to keep them so I said on the final time, ""my mom bought them for me"" so he would understand to just drop it and keep them. But no. He decided to call them ""ugly"" and ""disgusting"" and that we should just throw them out. I silently started crying and went into the bathroom to gather myself.

I came out again and he was in the process of putting them in the bin and I said no I want to keep them because they mean something to me, and that my ill mom had thought of me and bought them.  

He proceeded to tell me they were ""disgusting "" again and said they were cheap and just be thrown out. I got annoyed at this point because he kept going on about the lights, I told him that when I asked him if he wanted to keep XYZ  I didn't question it. 

So this ended up in a big argument that he doesn't seem to think was his fault. I only got angry after I told him my mom got them for me and he kept insisting they should be thrown out.

It was the only thing in the closet that I wanted to keep :( he kept loads of things and I only wanted to keep one thing. I know it's stupid but I cherish the thought of my mom picking up the lights and being excited to give them to me.

Although we live in Arkansas, she is a huge Dallas Mavericks fan. I'm not into sports. Dirk Nowitzki announced at their last home game that he was retiring. We watched the ceremony at his last game on TV and she cried a bit. I dont get the emotional attachment but she cares so I care about that. We watched his last game yesterday and while she didn't cry, she was super emotional about it. As some back story, her mom passed away when she was 14. She hadn't been into sports outside of tennis but ended up watching basketball because she briefly had to stay with her siblings while her mom was in the hospital since her dad would work and then go to the hospital. After her mom passed, she threw herself into watching and cheering for the Mavs. It was the first year they went to the finals (2006) and even though they lost, she says it gave her something to look forward to and was a bright spot in a really rough time. She's been a huge fan ever since. 

Fast forward to this morning. We met up for breakfast and I brought up possible trips for next year. She then informed me that we might have to push back our trip. According to her, Dirk's jersey will probably be retired and, if it follows the trend of other players who have recently retired, it will probably be in March. She wants to go to the ceremony and knows she wont be able to take two trips back to back (money wise or work time off wise). She told me she would love for me to join her (she'd pay for both tickets) because its important to her. 

I'm annoyed. He didn't die. He just won't be playing anymore. Since she was 14, she's seen him play live twice (though never in Dallas because somehow that matters) and I told her that postponing our trip so she could watch them hang a jersey was dumb. I also don't understand the big deal behind retiring a jersey. She told me that she was disappointed that I couldn't understand why this was important and that her wanting me with her was significant. I told her I was taking a trip in March and she was welcome to join but I wasn't going to postpone a trip I look forward to to go sit and be bored.

As I got older I would go to her house to pet sit, for dinner, to play games, or we’d just meet for lunch. She got married about 7 years ago and I also became close to her wife, another aunt. During all this I was in and out of relationships, some they met, some they didn’t. But for some reason they really latched on to my most recent ex. 

My ex and I were together for about 2,5 years and about 2 years in we started having major problems. A couple months in to our “problem time” my aunts invited me over for brunch. It started as brunch but what it really turned into an accusation. They started telling me that I’m not trying hard enough, that I’m giving up, and telling me I should go to counseling and it’s my (now) ex to work on our problems. I left in tears because I felt cornered that they were ganging up on me. I was also told by my ex during one of our fights that they were talking to him, he was hanging out at their house (he worked close to them), and they were offering him a place to stay when we would fight. To my knowledge, they still communicate with him.

If it matters, my ex and I split because he was a liar (finances and criminal history mostly), played a victim, and used me as a crutch.

Since then I’ve only been to their house for family gatherings where everyone is there. I don’t go to events with just them anymore, and frankly I don’t want to be around them. I realize I don’t “own” my ex and they can have a relationship with him if they want, what I’m most upset about is they chose to believe his side of arguments over mine after knowing him for only 2 years. I’ll get over it, but it’s been less than a year and I’ve distanced myself tremendously from them. I still love them and if they really really needed it, I would help because we’re family.

Anyways I wanted to go four wheeler riding with my friends instead and told her that I didn’t want to go to a kids birthday party and she said “it’s only two hours, can’t you go with them afterwards” but by this point I was so tired of her making me go to things I didn’t want to do I just told her no and I broke up with her.

I met my girlfriend at the beginning of 2018, right after cashing out. We've been going out for over a year now. I plan on telling her whenever we move in together, but for now, she does not know.

Question is, AITA for this? I'm basically keeping a huge part of my life secret from everyone. On the other hand, I am not entirely stingy about my money. I've gotten my family and friends great (but reasonable) gifts, have loaned my mom money, etc. On the other hand, I am sometimes flat-out lying when I say I can't afford to do something, or when I joke about being poor.

1,"AITA for missing my husband’s first day at new job this morning so I could go to Tana Mongeau and Jake Paul's wedding last night? | I’m not even sure if asshole is the right word here because I don’t even know if I messed up or if I should have agency to make my own choices in situations like this. 

Backstory is my husband got a huge promotion at work and today is his first day. It’s a promotion that not only comes with a huge salary increase but pretty much cements his position in an upper management tract within this company. I also appreciate that him working so hard has allowed me to follow my passions and not just have a “job.” So I don’t want there to me any misunderstanding that I don’t appreciate what he does. 

He had plans yesterday to go golfing with the people in his new office, followed by a “mans man” steak dinner and cigars. So he was essentially going to be gone all day. At about noon my best friend called and said that she had gotten last minute passes into Tana Mongeau and Jake Paul's wedding in Vegas. I was like you have to be shitting me. She asked if I could go, I said that my husband was out all day and since Vegas is only 6 hours...why not. 

We hit the road and had literally the time of my life. We got to see the fake fight, I got to meet Armani, we met a ton of people we knew from IG, danced all night, it was such a great time and we didn’t leave the club until well after 6am. We crashed at an a guys room we met at the club and I’m just now coming to life (it’s 9:45) and need to get on the road home. 

I forgot to charge my phone so it died sometime around 11 last night and I woke up to a crazy amount of angry messages and texts from my husband. All amounted to “uhhh maybe it’s not a good idea to drive to Vegas and let me find out from Instagram?” And bitchy stuff like that and then finally “did you forget your promise to meet me at work for breakfast with my bosses this morning?” (Which yes, I did) but I hated the tone of it all. 

To me he was gone all day, i had an invite to a once in a lifetime event, how can he possibly expect me NOT to go? Yes I forgot something important to Him but he forgets stuff too so NBD, or at least NBD after I apologize but no reason to blow up my shit with angry texts.

Initially, I was very hesitant to keep anything, but my mother pointed out the kind of (hoarder seems too harsh?) keeper my grandmother was, and that she would have been overjoyed if I kept any of her things. As it stands, I don't have a nice set of dishes in my apartment, and I saw a beautiful green set in her attic. I decided I was going to keep them and take them with me when I moved into my first house. Around the edges, there's a set of characters that I didn't know what they meant, but I loved the dishes, so I packed them and put them away.

Recently, I (a white woman) was telling a friend (another white woman) about these plates and she asked me to show her a photo of them. I asked my mother to send a picture and asked her if she knew what the characters were. She told me that they were letters from the Sequoyah alphabet, and my grandmother had purchased the plates on a trip to New Mexico when she was younger. I showed my friend the pictures and told her this, and she told me that I could not keep the plates. She said owning a set of dishes with Native American writing on them was cultural appropriation and I was disrespecting a culture by owning them.

We have been weighing all the pros and cons of having booze at our wedding—the quantity, the alcoholic content, the time it would be available to the guests. My fiancé has been sober 7+ years. We have not drank since we met and since we have an infant, I have no desire to drink myself. Therefore, when we are contemplating alcohol or not, it is really for our guests and not us personally. Should we offer free beer and charge for mixed drinks? Just champagne for toasts? Beer only? Because it is our wedding celebrating our union, we decided to nix the alcohol entirely and haven’t yet made that news public to the people we will invite.

We will be having a huge event (300+) with people of all ages. I should mention that my fiancé is Mexican and when he describes Mexican weddings to me, it is tradition for people to bring booze and/or money for the happy event.

I said I'd consider fostering or maybe adopting, but it's unlikely. I also said I don't want kids because I want to be someone's favourite person, and a child would end up being my partner's favourite.

I said that they’re not technically mixed, they’re 3/4 white. I consider them white. If someone is 3/4 something, it’s dumb to hold onto another fourth.

My husband and I live pretty far away from our families, but we’re really excited that his whole family is coming to visit us for the week of Thanksgiving!  We have a decent-sized house, so we have invited everyone to stay with us for the week.  

However, my BIL’s girlfriend is apparently allergic to dogs, and we have a ~13/14 year old (very furry) pup whom we obviously love very much.  Now, it’s probably not *impossible* for us to find a friend to watch our pup for a week, or maybe we could pay a dog-sitter to take her, but all things being equal we’d prefer not to.  The whole family (except for BIL’s gf) has met our pup before, and they all love her (and she loves them!)  BIL + gf are going to try staying here, and we are going to do our best to clean, but if it gets to be too much for her we’ve offered to point them to a nice hotel nearby.

On the one hand, our pup was here first.  She’s an important part of our family, like any good pupper should be!  OTOH, if the roles were reversed and I was meeting my boyfriend’s brother for the first time, in an unfamiliar city, I might feel left out that I couldn’t stay where the whole family is staying.

To be clear, I don’t think my BIL or his gf are being assholes.  They have not actually asked us to relocate our furry friend while they are here.  The gf did ask my BIL to rehome his cat when she moved in with him (a request he complied with) so removing animals based on her presence is not without precedent.  I’m just wondering if we are being ungracious hosts (and assholes) by not offering to do so.

1,"AITA for inviting everyone except my sister to Thanksgiving? | I was never close with my older sister. 4 years ago, she moved across the country with her husband. They were never really around to begin with but it got worse after they moved. They stopped spending holidays with us and my sister became angry with all of us over things that happened years ago when we were kids. 

She adopted a victim complex and started fighting with my mom about everything. She made outlandish accusations toward my mom and my other sister. Spewed a lot of psychobabble about being the ""scapegoat"" of the family and having ""PTSD"" from her ""rough"" childhood. Things were going so well with my family at the moment and she didn't have to dredge up the past but she did because she was always one to stir the pot. She keeps complaining about not being a part of the family but she's the one pushing us all away. 

Honestly, I somewhat understand where she's coming from because my parents weren't the best parents growing up. But it's all in the past and we've all moved on. I have a great relationship with my mom, and it's hard watching her get upset when my sister sends her another angry email or text message. My mom ignores her but she won't block her so she still has to see these vile messages. 

My sister was always OK with me. She used to vent to me and my wife about my family (and sometimes I'd vent to her too) but one day I firmly told her to stop living in the past. We just had our son and I wanted my son to grow up in a close and happy family. I didn't want him to grow up being exposed to my sister's anger and bitterness about the past. After that, she sort of stopped talking to me.

In spring 2018, she got mad at all of us for not texting her husband on his birthday, which is an issue that comes up every year. I felt bad but we were never close with her husband. We all decided to give her space and none of us had heard from her by the time Thanksgiving rolled around. My son's 1st birthday was the day before Thanksgiving. My wife and I threw a birthday/Thanksgiving celebration and we invited everyone in my family except my sister. We figured she wouldn't come anyway and I didn't want to deal with her angry BS on a joyous occasion. Even my dad, who's a bully and who I've never been close with, flew 1500 miles to be there.

0,"Aita for not giving my children two surnames because I’m Mexican? | So I (45M) and my wife Geri (46) have been together for 30 years and married for 20. We were 15 and 16 when we started dating and we were teen parents as we have a son, Frank (28M). We also have a younger daughter, Lucy (16F). For context, I was born in Mexico. I moved to the US as a kid with my parents but I still spoke Spanish and as I got older spent time back and forth between the 2 countries and even lived back in Mexico. for a few years with Geri and Frank so I still have a strong Mexican accent. 

Anyway, when Frank was born, we gave him the surname I go by which is from my paternal line. I myself have 2 surnames so for example my name is ______ Sanchez Gutierrez. Sanchez is my paternal name so that’s what I go by and it didn’t make sense to give my son my given surname with my wife’s added on. The Hispanic surname combined with hers didn’t work so Frank is just Frank Sanchez and our daughter is Lucy Sanchez. Geri took that name too when we got married so she is Geri Sanchez.

Anyway moving onto the story. My mother left when I was a kid and only came back recently after 30+ years. We have been trying to reconnect and I want her to know her grandchildren. It was going fine until recently the topic of conversation came to my kids’ surnames. She assumed they were Sanchez Gutierrez too and went by Sanchez. I just said that no, they’re just Sanchez and she threw an almighty hissy fit.

My mother decided to accuse me of whitewashing my children and trying to downplay their Mexican heritage. That in my opinion is bullshit as their surname is Hispanic, they can speak decent Spanish, they have dark features like me and I’ve always incorporated their mom’s background and mine as equal as possible. She didn’t believe any of that and said I should have given her both my surname’s and I even had to tell her Hispanic naming customs were the family surname of the mother and father and that Geri’s family surname clearly wasn’t Gutierrez. I also had to tell my mom that my kids were American and of Mexican descent. She then called me an AH, once again accusing me of practically whitewashing them and she said I should be ashamed of the name I gave my kids.

Geri is on my side, but my mom is trying her hardest to convince my kids I’m the AH and they’re caught in the middle.

Fast forward a year, my boyfriend and his friends  started to talk about Japan sporadically and made many jokes about wanting to go back to Japan again.

We have spoken about moving in together after this is over, and he is always thoughtful and kind to me.

I'm private about relationships. My parents didn't know about either of my other relationships until they were over; they met one ex after we broke up, and have never met the other. It's not a commentary on the relationship, it's just how we handle things. I have 4 brothers-- the eldest has brought two girls home, one of whom died 3 years into the relationship and one he has been with for 4 years. Another brother brought home one boyfriend, who is now his fiancé. There is no strict rule -- my parents say they're happy to hear even about crushes or brief relationships -- but I tend to just do as my brothers do.

My parents came to visit to celebrate my birthday, and I arranged a dinner with some friends -- K, my roommates, and my ex, C, with whom I am still close. My parents had previously met C and one roommate, so when we all got together as a group to walk over to the restaurant, I introduce K and the other roommates just by their names, ""you know my friends C and M, and this is K and this is J"", trying to keep everything casual.

During the evening, K takes me aside quietly to say that when I had invited him, he had thought this was **the** meeting of the parents, and that he would be introduced as my boyfriend.

I explained that, given I had **never** introduced a current boyfriend to my parents, or even told them about him, I didn't want to add any pressure to him and give them the chance to get to know him without the filter of him being their youngest and only daughter's new boyfriend. He said it made him question how seriously I take our relationship, if I was still waiting for **the** person to bring home after 15 months together.

&#x200B;

It was during exam period for university. 3 days before my first exam, we went on a casual date to the local mall. I thought it would be good to meet up and release some of our stress. We had Chinese noodles for lunch. While eating, we got talking. I was telling her about a YouTube video I watched the other day. It was an informative speech made by a psychologist about cheating. The psychologist explained most cheaters don't go out of their way to cheat. And when it happens, most people are surprised they're doing it themselves. It's almost unexpected. She also explained how cheating has existed for a very long time where we probably won't be able to get rid of it as a social condition. I felt I learned a different perspective of cheating and thought to share this to my gf at the time. I didn't notice anything wrong straight away. The meal continued as normal and we talked about different things as well. When we finished the meal, we paid and proceeded to browse the shops. She got progressively worse and when I asked her what was wrong it was like she was having an anxiety attack. She wouldn't talk to me for the remainder of the date and we walked out of the mall back to the car. 

&#x200B;

One the way back and in the car, I occasionally tried to start up a conversation but she felt silent. I was growing more flustered and had no idea what was going on. She began by questioning me and asking me questions about cheating. I answered and was thinking through the topic as well. It's safe to say I have never thought about some of the questions she asked me in a proper and serious manner. Especially considering how flustered I became, the environment where we had this talk wasn't calm in the least. Our discussion kept on going around in a circle and it felt like she wasn't listening to me at all and only feeding into her own fear. She kept on brushing off everything I said and wasn't taking it in at all. 

&#x200B;

She finally asked me ""Would you ever cheat on me?"" Part of me knew obviously to say ""No."" Even if I agreed or disagreed, I understand feelings are still important. The other half wanted to stay true to me and my way of thinking. I was thinking about what the lady said in the video and how things can just happen. I also didn't want to say a promise I couldn't keep. In the end I chose to say something along the lines of not answering with a firm no. Something like ""I cannot promise you that"". She got very sad and upset. That was the last time we ever talked in person. I sent a very long apology text later that night after thinking it through. I knew I had hurt her.

Of course when I got the call, I was devestated. We had been married for just two years. Now I was only 27 and widowed. It took months of healing and regaining my faith in God and in this world to move. In part of that healing, I posted a tribute of her to my Instagram (at the time of her passing) saying all these things I wanted her to be remembered for. I ended it with ""I will always love you, *name*, rest in peace my love.""

A few months ago I met a new girl at work. We hit off really well and things picked up fast. She was a bit controlling, but I kind of liked it, that someone was really protective of me. It wasn't overbearing controlling, but just enough to make me feel cherished. A few days ago though, (and my now GF knows of my deceased wife), said she saw my tribute post to her and asked if I could take it down. 

I was really confused and asked why; she said ""it has love, that is the present tense, do you still love her?"" and ""its been three years, you need to move on."" 

I told her ""I loved my late wife, and I have moved on, that why I felt ready to date you."" She then said ""if thats true, you should have no problem deleting the post."" I dont want to delete the post though. She was still my wife, she died tragically, she deserves to be remembered for more than just being a wife, she was  great person - and a nurse, too.

0,"AITA for being jealous of my husbands close relationship with his aunt | 
This is my first time posting I hope it makes sense. 

So me and my husband have been married for a year now. We decided to skip the whole wedding and just elope as my father passed away that year. I don’t have any extended family but he comes from a very big and close knit family. (All of whom live in a different country except his Aunty and uncle) 
I only met them once before we got married and immediately I realised she didn’t want him to get married. 

After we got married he was supposed to move in with me but he kept making excuses that he didn’t just want to leave his auntys house that quickly because it would be rude. I agreed just to make things easy. 
Fast forward a few months he finally moved in. I thought this would be the beginning for us to spend more time together. We picked one day out of the week to be together usually a Wednesday which is his day off. Usually when the day comes his Aunty and uncle call atleast 15 times telling him to come over and every single time he blows off any plans he has with me to go to them. 

I tried to be understanding that they are the only close family he has here but I never get to spend any quality time with him. 
He always makes excuses when he hasn’t seen them for a few days. 

Even when he talks to them on the phone he gives them undivided attention. There has been occasions that she or her husband call him while we are in bed and he’ll get up to talk to them sometimes even leaving the room
but when his talking to me about something important  his always on his phone or watching something and barely listens. This always results in a fight. 


I grew up with family dinners so I tried to keep that tradition so I make sure that we have dinner together every night. His Aunty has since started sending him food in the day so that when he comes home he has food to eat. He stopped eating what I made because she makes him traditional back home meals. 

Our marriage broke down fast he stopped caring for me. When I found out I couldn’t have kids after years of trying he left me crying in bed and was busy dealing with his auntys drama. 

I asked to separate a few weeks ago and he moved out. We have started talking again but he refuses to acknowledge how priorities his aunt over his life with me. 

I have never had any aunts or uncles he keeps telling me it’s normal to be that close to your family. I don’t know if I’m making a big deal about nothing

0,"AITA for not wanting to stay for 6 months with my mother while she is going through divorce? | (First time posting, will edit if there are any issues or if some points not understood)

So here is the basic situation, I (23M) live in a city which is 6 hours away by bus but 1 hour flight away from my home.

This is my last semester, so after one month i finish my university studies. Now in the middle of the semester when I went back home for one week (like a winter break) on the first day a fight broke between my parents (48M) (44F)and apparently my dad had another woman in his life other than my mom (not the first time btw), and on that week all hell broke loose. within 2 weeks my mother wanted to separate quietly but my dad wanted custody and my mom didn't agree, so my mom files a law suit for the divorce and in this whole time my dad is denying all this and saying that my mother is hallucinating (but he doesn't know that my mother has evidence on him and not planning on telling him until the day of the hearing which really makes arguing impossible).

Now i'm living in a lively city, its like the newyork of my country and i love it, i just met a girl im in love with and its been going great, i'm taking latin dance lessons and it really helped me take my mind of all this, my friends are here, the job potential is better here, my workout routine is set here, my network is here, everything that matters to me and that i did through all these 4 years is here in this city, unlike my hometown.

Yesterday i call my mother to check  on her as always, and immediately starts asking when i'm coming back and says that when i do i need to stay by her side to support her and that she needs a man by her side (i saw this coming eventually and whenever the topic started in the past i always implied that i'm not coming back to stay). The period she wants me to stay is 6 months, until the summer or until my 17 year old sister finishes her university exam and gets into university, then we can all move to the city that i studied in. When i told her that that is not possible and i'm not willing to stay for that much all the time, she started arguing how i am selfish, not thinking about her and what shes going through and that i'm her eldest son and she did not raise me to be like that type of person. I don't believe that my mom is going to move to my city without my dad having a word about that for the custody of my little sister, and if she leaves alone, what about my sisters? i don't know what is going on through her head.

I'm willing to go back every 2 weeks back home, and willing to bounce on a plane given the emergency.

I get it my mother is going through a tough time, i need to be by her side, that my father cheated on her and its devastating, i get it that family matters and family must come first, but i don't want to live in all that negativity and stress for that long, i don't need it, i don't want it.

Last week, he asked me (22) and both of my brothers (20 and 18) to be his best men.

When we first got together and talked about our friends, She discribed her friend group as mixed but more guys than girls, This struck me as odd but since they all seemed to hang out in one big group I didn't have a problem with it.

Within a few months however, all the other girls had stopped hanging in the group, Some were dating guys in the group and they broke up (My GF always sided with the guys in these instances) a couple moved out of the city for work or school. Within six months of our initial conversation, Her friend group had turned almost exclusively male (She does have a couple female friends, But they aren't close) She'd be going out to bars with groups of 4-8 guys on the weekend, Going to parties at their houses, Sometimes staying on their couches (I'd offer to pick her up and drive her home, But they have a tradition of all getting breakfast together the morning after a party) 

I started to have a problem with this pretty quickly, It was different when it was a mixture, But having my girlfriend alone with guys all the time was weird and it just didn't sit right with me.
I pretty sure she doesn't want to bang any of them, But I'd bet at least a couple want to bang her.

When I mentioned my feelings to my girlfriend, She got super pissed, Particularly she seemed pissed that I was insinuating that they only saw her as a ""piece of ass""
Massive fight ensued, We made up eventually but only because I shut up about them.

I'm not upset she is a girl. But he was in love with her for years until I came into the pictures, they have never slept together, but have made out on several drunken nights. He says he is not in love with her anymore, and she always turned down his efforts to form a relationship with her in the past. But since we have been together, she has consistently shared things on social media about him. Pictures of them kissing each others cheeks, swimming together, and laying down together. They look really happy in their pics. He never really takes pictures with me, but they have millions. And she always shares them with some love quote, hearts, and recently a post stating that if they were single when they were 30 they would get married. 

In the first few months of our relationship,  she was ok with me in person but in several group chats with her and his friends has said mean stuff about me not belonging there, or just negative in general. He never replied or stood up for me, and when I got upset all his other friends got mad at me. When I asked why he didnt stand up for me he said it was because he didnt want his other friends being mad at him. This girl (who when she isnt around, all his friends and him dont even refer to her as a friend, calling her a ho and saying she is attention seeking) doesnt seem to care we are in a committed relationship.

She invites just him to stuff, and later will say ""your gf can come too!"" if he brings me up. But it feels a bit like now that my fiance isnt trying to get in her pants constantly she missed that attention. So now shes trying to get it back.

Whenever I ask why he is still friends with her when she publicly says stuff about me or when she post stuff about him and he doesnt say anything he always gives different excuses. Making it feel like shes more important to him than our relationship is.

I was enlisted in the Marine Corps for 4 years and commissioned in the Army for 6. I'm pretty laid back in a lot of things, but I can never ignore when someone tells obvious lies about their military service, and I feel compelled to confront them when they do.

I was not infantry in the Marines, but I served in an infantry unit for nearly 3 years, and I found that to be more in line with what I wanted to do. I got out, got my degree, and commissioned into the Army as an infantry officer, and got out as a Captain, which is when it stops being fun.

In my time, i have seen a best friend bleeding out of his nose and mouth with 2 bullets in his lungs, knowing his kids were about to be orphaned by him and his wife would be a young widow (amazingly he loved, despite dying twice). I've been shot at, and blown up. I've had rockets fired at my base and when we were on patrol. I've known a 19 year old kid with the biggest grin who widowed his wife and orphaned his unborn child. I've known a young man who died after losing his lower half to an IED. I've known a brilliant friend who got taken out by small arms fire. And more than a few others who've gone the same way.

Whenever my wife and I are somewhere, be it a party, a restaurant, a store, wherever, and I hear someone talking about their service, I always listen in for the cliche key phrases. 95% of the time, it's a legitimate veteran, and I leave it be and go back to what I was doing, or we chat briefly about our time. 

Sometimes, however, I hear the phrases all of the liars seem to have learned in the same class. ""Oh, my job? They would tell me what to blow up, so I'd go blow it up."" That's not a job. ""I was a sniper, but I cant talk about it because so much was classified."" Then why'd you bring it up? ""I  hung out with Special Forces so much they wound up taking me on missions."" Bull. Shit. 

Also, when they start talking about their supposed PTSD. Now, I have PTSD. I know plenty of people ACTUALLY suffer from it. But a lot of people lie to create these movie scene quality breakdowns for attention. 

Whenever I'm faced with someone doing this, I start the usual litany of questions to let them talk themselves into a hole. Things like their unit, base, when they deployed, where they went, what their MOS was specifically, things like that. Usually, they start getting more and more vague, or they'll chuck out the ol' standby that most of what they did was classified.

A few days later we obsessively looked for any information regarding any obituaries for D or confirmation that he was dead. A friend of mine managed to get a hold of one of D's uncles. 

The uncle confirmed that D is alive and well.

It gets worse. Seconds after it was confirmed he's alive, D's Twitter was deleted. And a few hours later his other social media accounts went down too, which is especially shady since the husband claimed that he didn't have access to his other accounts.

1,"AITA for refusing to re-rack my weights at the gym? | I know it's proper gym ettiquete at most gyms to re-rack all your weights, that was the case at my last gym and I always re-racked my weights.

For the past 6 years I've been working out at my stations gym, I love it, has everything I need and usually I'm the only one working out. For the past 6 years I really only see the same 5-6 people working out at different times, everyone else comes in from time to time. I've repaired a lot of the equipment here from my own pocket, bring in gear like belts, chalk, rope, etc for everyone to use.

Well a few days ago I was squatting 225, after I was done with my sets, I took one 45 from each side off and left one 45 on both sides of the bar. I then went to do some deadlifts. In the middle of my set a woman(who I've never seen before) comes up to me and traps me on the shoulder. I put the weight down and take my headphones off. She asks me if I'm done with the squat rack, I said ""yeah go ahead"" and put my headphones back in. She motions again and says ""well you need to put your weights back on the racks"". I look at her with a confused look. She says that the weights can bend the bar (no they won't) and some people who work out there can't move 45 lbs by themselves (she wasn't talking about herself, I saw her benching 135). I told her if someone can't lift 45 lbs by themselves then they shouldn't be touching a barbell unattended( the bars are 45 lbs themselves), I then put my headphones back on and continued my workout ignoring her. She walked away mad and started to take pictures of the bar with the weights on and then pictures of me (idk what she was planning in doing with them and I didn't really care).
So my reasoning is this, there is not enough weigth trees for all the weights in the gym. In this gym it's customary to leave one 45 on each side of the bar, this includes the squat rack, all the bench presses, the deadlift area. Most people who workout here often are powerlifters, we just have this unwritten rule to leave the bar at 135, no more, no less. We rack the dumbbells and everything else but leave the bar at 135.
So AITA? I would have probably took the weights off if she didn't demand that I do so.

They live in the UK but every year they fly me out to Israel and we basically have a huge party all summer. They are really kind and since my mom remarried 4 years ago they have been really awesome to my stepbrother and stepsister. They buy them gifts and also have made donations to both their college funds since mine was outright paid by them.

My stepbrother is my best friend he’s the same age as me and we basically are the same guy in 2 bodies. Neither of us wanted our parents to remarry but it happened and me and Mike made the best of it. My stepsister on the other hand is an active bitch to my mom, my grandparents, but she’s especially nasty to me. It’s so bad that Mike also gets it and she calls him a traitor etc. She’s 15 btw. She scratches me if she sees me eating out of her ‘bowl’ that’s how crazy it is (it’s not her specific bowl it’s the family China wtf) 

Anyway my grandparents have never invited my stepsibs along but this time they asked if I wanted to invite them. I am SO PUMPED to bring Mike but I told my grandparents I don’t want my stepsister to come along. 

My grandparents were very tactful when they told my mom and stepdad and they said that they wanted to show Israel to my stepbro this year and then next year they’d take my stepsister but my mom knows the real reason and isn’t talking to me cuz she thinks I’m doing it to be spiteful.

1,"AITA for asking my husbands sister to consider being a surrogate for us? | My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.

Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.

We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.

Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids.

It's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",False,False,3,4,5,1,2,3,Loyalty

My wife's mother, my step son's other grandmother, and many of her girlfriends were invited.

My Mother immediately liked every single photo, and when I texted her she brought up that she wished she had received an invitation to the shower. I apologized for excluding her and explained that I only invited those that I thought were within the appropriate distance to attend.

Throughout that entire time, she has never been comfortable with my relationship with my female best friend who i have known since high school.

My friend is someone very special, and very close to me. She is smart, caring, beautiful, and an extremely loving and funny person. She honestly does mean the world to me and since freshman year in highschool she has been the one who has been with me through so many events in my life, including my moms passing.

My fiance has been in my life for eight months, and can't understand the bond that I have with my best friend. She has openly told me that it makes her uncomfortable how I spend time with her. I usually try to change the subject but now that we're engaged shes become a lot more hostile to both me and my best friend.

What really pissed me off is that she almost drove my best friend to tears recently over dinner, basically indirectly criticizing her for always hanging around someone elses man instead of finding her own.

I confronted my fiance in private and she just asked me to not invite her to the wedding. I put my foot down and said that I love her, and that the type of relationship i have with her comes once in a lifetime. I may have also crossed the line in the heat of the moment by calling my best friend my soul mate, as i was just trying to articulate how much i love her as it does goes beyond just being a best friend.

My fiance basically breaks down crying, (she does this a lot to get her way) and says that i must hate her. I say I hate the way you're acting. She then asks what my friend has that she doesn't, and I decide not to engage any further.

Later I tell her the truth of the matter is that I love them both, and I just want everyone to get a long. She says im being emotionally abusive for telling her that I love another woman.

1,"AITA for possibly encouraging my son to break up with his girlfriend and telling him I have regrets about marrying his mother/my wife? | My son will be starting college this fall. He will be attending a school out of state while his girlfriend stays home to attend college. Because of the distance, they have been discussing whether or not they will try to make things work, and they have struggled to make a decision. He asked his mom and me what we thought he should do, and for a long time I refused to advise him other than to make some very high level comments and generalizations. His mother/my wife, on the other hand, has encouraged him to stay with his girlfriend, even though I asked her to remain impartial. 

My son continued to ask me for my opinion, and because his mom weighed in I felt like he needed to hear my perspective. This is because my wife has used us as an example to show him that high school sweethearts can last. She is not wrong, but she has only given one side of our story to our son and I felt he needed to know my perspective, which I have not shared with our kids until now.

To make a long story short, we were high school sweethearts, but in many ways I regret choosing to make a commitment to my wife when we were so young. We had a similar issue. I applied to graduate schools and ended up getting offers from schools in NY and LA which I really liked. I would have probably attended one, but my wife did not want to move to either place, which forced me to choose. I have always wondered how my life would have gone had I chosen a different path. 

I told my son all of this and advised him to think about if he wants that hanging over him while he is away at school. To be tied down like this during the best years of his life is going to give him a very different college experience and probably limit him in many ways. I did not tell him he should break up, but I did strongly urge him to consider if he is prepared to make that sacrifice and end up like me wondering what he missed out on.

Apparently my daughter overheard this conversation and relayed it to my wife. My wife has taken this very hard (and so have my daughters), but I don't think what I said was wrong. I don't think I am wrong for wanting our son to avoid the same. He has many plans which are not compatible with what his girlfriend wants (she is a local girl like my wife and probably will never want to leave our town or explore the world), so either he is going to end up fighting her over this and feeling bad because he wants to experience life or things will ultimately not work out. If the latter is the case, it is better to end it now so that at least he can enjoy college.

I understand something will always go wrong at a wedding, and it'll never be ""perfect"", but as long as it's with her I'll be happy. 

She gave me one task for the whole wedding: Make sure my groomsmen are matching. Simple enough. I found some slacks online for 40 bucks and told my groomsmen they could wear whatever they want for a shirt, but the pants must all be the same color. I sent the link to them for the pants 5 months ago and it seemed everything was in order.

I just got a message from one of them saying he blew it, and he ""wished"" he'd  had an excuse, and he needs the link for the pants again. That's fine, but then he messages again saying he already has pants of that color anyways and he'll just wear those. I tell him as long as they're the EXACT same color, and to check with another one of the groomsmen who lives near him to see if they match. He responds jokingly, and now I'm concerned that he's gonna show up to the wedding in completely off-colored pants. If that is the case, I don't even want him up there. He was already extremely difficult during the bachelor party, and generally had a bad attitude because I didn't want to order strippers. He is my longest childhood friend, and it'd suck for him not to be up there with me, but his selfish behavior has only gotten worse as we grow older.

My boyfriend (23) has this one male friend ""Matt"" (23) he seems unusually close to. They've known each other since kindergarten so maybe that'd explain the fact that they're so attached to one another.

However... And excuse me if I'm being offensive, but literally everyone who meets Matt is convinced he's gay. When I first met him, I was almost sure of it. I went to art school, something like 90% of my male friends were gay so I'd think I have a pretty good gaydar. My best (gay) friend even said ""yup, that guy likes dick"" as soon as he saw Matt.

Matt laughs that stuff off though, as does my boyfriend. Normally I'd take his word for it, but his behavior says otherwise. I think Matt has a thing for my boyfriend.

For example... Last year, Matt had a girlfriend of 5 months. They broke up specifically because Matt wanted to go vacationing *only* with my boyfriend, that is his best friend, not his girlfriend. And that's something they regularly do together: take trips completely alone, without other friends or partners.

It also seems like Matt feels entitled to spending more time with my boyfriend than anyone else. He easily gets jealous if my boyfriend cancels their plans to hang out with me and my friends.

To top it all off, my boyfriend did admit Matt once tried to make out with him, then kiss his neck back in college. They were drunk though, and my boyfriend doesn't think much of it. I'm convinced otherwise, however.

But while we were abroad, we realized that the passion in our relationship was gone. Without the kids and our regular routines around, we were basically just platonic friends. After about eight months abroad,she asked me for a divorce and I agreed.

I moved back to the US, to a different state than where I'd lived before. After I got here, I ran into a woman (now 27f) who had been friends with my kids in high school.

0,"AITA for seeing family my mother has denied me access to? | The title is very oversimplified so let me explain. Hang in there, because it's going to be a long explanation.

Up until my parents got divorced, we had a great relationship with my moms side of the family. They'd come visit at least 4 times a year and we always went to my grandmother's house in Florida over spring break. Seeing them was always my favorite part of the year and there was never any issues with it.

Now, when my parents got divorced my mom decided she didn't want me and my siblings to have any communication with her side if the family. She sent a lot of angry, untrue emails about my dad to her side of the family, but they took my dad's side. My dad thought she was just angry because of that and would let up on it soon enough (she's known to make bad, rash decisions when upset). Keeping that in mind, he allowed her to put it in the divorce contract with the assumption the it would be dropped after a few weeks.

It's been almost 9 years and I miss my family. I haven't seen any of my mother's side, including my grandparents, for almost a decade. But recently, my dad took us on a vacation to Florida. I am almost at the age where the divorce contract will have no legal hold over me, so I went to visit my grandmother (she lived nearby).

I've never been given a straight answer as to why I'm not allowed to see them. My mother told me once that I wasn't allowed to see her sister because she was ""a heroin addict"" (totally not true) and that my grandma ""called me a bitch"" (also not true and definitely not a reason to ex-communicate your family), so I've always been confused and thought that this rule was ridiculous. My mom refuses to tell me the real reason why and I'm beginning to believe she doesn't actually have a substantial one. I've never had a bad experience with anyone from her side, and I feel like that that it's my desicion to make, especially seeing as it's basically to the point where I don't have to follow the contract anyway.

When we got back she asked if I'd seen them and I said yes (I didn't want to lie to her) and she went ballistic. I understand that I went against her wishes, and I get that it wasn't cool, but there was no reasoning behind why I couldn't. As I said before she's always changed the subject in a way that leads me to believe that she doesn't actually have a reason and it's just so she feels like she has power over me. So AITA?

Ever since my grandfather passed away, my grandmother has been very reliant on my mum and me (aunt/mum's sister isn't very nice and lives quite a distance away) which makes sense. Due to bereavement, her memory has gotten a bit worse but she's had medical tests and there's nothing permanent. She needs glasses and a hearing aid (but refuses to wear them). I love my grandmother but I am more protective of my mum. I can see that my grandmother constantly relying on my mum to do everything for her (besides bathe her) is taking a toll. My grandmother is competent but doesn't want to learn how to do anything my grandfather did for her. 

Now the event that leads me to ask AITA: recently, whenever my mum has given my grandmother a time to arrive, she is always an hour to two hours early. Even if these times are 9:00am, she will arrive at 7:30am. Even if she writes the time down, no matter how many times my mum or myself tell her a time, she is always early. This used to be just a bit annoying but now she has started barging in when my mum is with clients (mum is a mental health adviser) and doesn't understand why my mum won't give her attention/hang out with her. I put my foot down and said that it's getting too much and is getting in the way of my mums work. Grandmother's response is that we treat her horribly and she wants my mum to quit her job. I tell her ""you need to be on time, check your phone or watch for the time. 15 minutes early is fine but an hour isn't! My mum is working."" She asks ""what do you expect me to do?""

1,"AITA for reaching out to my future sister in law? | Me: 30s/F

Brother (Sean): 30/M

His fiancé: (Ashley): 31/F

Ashley’s sister: 33/F (I’ll call her Kate) 

My brother Sean has been dating Ashley for 2 years, and they got engaged about two months ago.  

Ashley has always been very kind to me and my family.  But she isn’t close with her blood siblings.  And by not close I mean like... she hasn’t talked to them in years.  Not a single word.  They don’t even exchange birthday or Christmas cards.  I’ve met her parents and they seem fine so I don’t think there’s any big trauma.    I on the other hand, am very very close with my brother and sister.  I couldn’t bear not contacting them on their birthdays or Christmas.

Ashley is one of those people who can wiggle out of any conversation.  Example:

Me: how’s Kate?

Ashley: she’s fine as far as I know.

Me: don’t you want to find out?  I’d want to know how my sister is. 

Ashley: oh, would you? 

Me: yeah, I would.  She’s your blood relative. 

Ashley: yep she is.

Etc. etc. etc.  it’s pretty rude if I’m honest.  Recently she and Sean got engaged.  I was very curious about her extended family, so I did some social media digging and found her sister Kate.  I messaged her, just saying hi and explaining we will be related soon.  

Kate seems absolutely fine and like a nice person.  I can't understand why Ashley would write her off.

I told Ashlry I connected with Kate, and she got extremely mad, said I had no right to reach out to her.  Sean also said I was the asshole, but he was a little gentler.

0,"AITA for not wanting to go to family gatherings with my SO? | First post, sorry if it isnt up to standards but I need clarification & advice as to if I am over reacting.

A little bit of background:

His culture is very social, they are very family oriented and like to go out to each others houses and celebrate and party. They hug and kiss every single person when they arrive and hug and kiss when they leave the event. His family is always together and thoroughly enjoy socializing until the sun comes up (literally).

&#x200B;

My family is the opposite.  I guess we don't really have cultural social traditions like my boyfriend does. We rarely go to parties because my parents just prefer not to. Both of their jobs are extremely social (Mom is an ER Nurse and my dad is a police officer) so they just want to come home and relax. I never had to socialize with other people besides school and work.

&#x200B;

So, him and I have been together for a year and his family absolutely loves me and I love them too. I am always invited to any social gathering they go to. I went to thanksgiving with them at their uncles house and I felt so left out I  never wanted to go to another gathering with them again. When we walked through the door, I was greeted with tons of hugs and kisses from people I don't know, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. I do NOT like being touched by strangers, and I hate being forced to do so. I sucked it up and started the night off with some wine to calm some my nerves and some anxiety. It only got worse from there. His friends and family don't prefer to speak English and that is the only language I speak. So my boyfriend had to translate for me or summarize the conversation while I just sit there and nod with a smile. I wanted to go home. They kept asking him things about me in their native language when they could have said it in English to me. His family knew I was uncomfortable the moment I had to hug and kiss everyone, and his sister pulled me aside and said ""Its our tradition, you need to get used to it."" I got mad and said ""Well that is not MY tradition."" Which now that i look back on it, i feel really disrespectful about. My boyfriend did not leave me side and tried to comfort me as much as he could, but I am not a very social person-- i cant even be social if they aren't speaking to me in English. I've even tried to pick up on some phrases to try to talk to them. They even expected me to stay out until 3/4 in the morning. I said no and I wanted to leave. I had enough. 

&#x200B;

The entire night made me feel uncomfortable and my boyfriend knew that. I don't want to go to other social gatherings with them again. I have told them I get some pretty bad social anxiety in situations like those and all they said was ""get well!"". I don't think they understand very well, as they don't have that issue.

0,"AITA for not hosting thanksgiving like I planned to | For about 50 years, my mom hosted all of her children and grandchildren for thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. She’s now gotten too old and asked us kids to take over the tradition. There are 4 of us so we just rotate. We’ve each hosted one holiday so far. This thanksgiving is my turn. 


We have never spent thanksgiving or Christmas Eve with my wife’s family. We’ve just never been as close to them plus they live all over the country. Well this year her mom and aunts decided to go to the Macy’s thanksgiving day parade. At first it was just a sister’s trip but then they decided to invite all their kids and grandkids to meet them up there. 


My wife really wants to go. She hasnt seen some of her aunts and cousins in years. Our daughter wants to go because it’s a “once in a lifetime event” (which i agree with). And I want to go.


As soon as we decided to go I called my older brother to see what we should do about thanksgiving because I can’t host this year. He said our oldest sister is going to be pissed and i have to tell her myself. He wished me luck.



So I call her and she is mad. She  says she’ll probably have to end up hosting even though she is up next for Christmas and I’m being inconsiderate of what our mom asked us to do. “Mom wouldn’t abandon thanksgiving to go to nyc” and went on about how sad mom will be that I’m doing this.


I offered to pay for them to rent a spot and have it catered but she said that takes away from the close knit family vibe. 


My brother said his wife might be up for it but he didn’t sound too happy about asking her. My other sister can’t do it because she’s renovating her house. 



I do feel bad for backing out of my turn but I tried to offer up solutions and I also offered to host the next holiday—which my oldest sister said no to because it’s her turn and she’s been planning for it all year. Next up is my brother so I said me and him could maybe just swap thanksgivings if his wife is up for it.

1,"AITA for not wanting to go to my sons wedding? | Throwaway.

My son has been dating 'Vanessa' for nearly 3 years now, last weekend they annouced they were enagaged. I have never been fond of Vanessa, mainly because she has never gelled with the family due to her general aloof attitude and lack of effort to engage socially. She will often refuse to join in conversations or activities. My son insists it's because shes shy but I think its very clear that she believes herself 'above us'.

I also strongly susspect she is using my son for his money, she has almost no income, she works as a nanny 2 days a week and spends the rest of the time selling hand made crafts on etsy or at markets. My son is in a well paid tech job and I think she is taking adavantage of the fact he's well off. She jumped at the opportunity to move into his nice aparetment very early in their relationship because she had been living in a unplesant house share. There have been other similar instances.

My son was at my house a few days after the annoucment and the conversation turned to the wedding. We were discussing venues and I mentioned our local church, he told me that Vanessa didn't like the idea of having it at church as she wasn't religious, she wanted an outside wedding. I told him that was just impractical, he has several older family members who would not only find the idea of a non religous, outdoor wedding distasteful but would struggle with the limitations that come with it, poor seating, lack of proper toilet facilities, bad weather etc. He said they would figure it out and it was their wedding so it shouldn't matter what the rest of the family thought. This is very unlike my son as I've always taught him to be considerate of others opinions and the value of family. 

At this point I was upset and hurt and told him that I didn't agree with the ideas they had come up with and I didn't want to put any money towards the wedding like this. My son got angry and told me that they didn't need any financial help, they had savings and Vanessa was planning to cut costs by making decorations. I said he was going to end up blowing all HIS savings and there was no way she'd be able to make all the decorsations with all the other things she'll be focusing on during planning so he'll end up paying for those too and they'll start married life with a huge dent in his savings which is just a terrible idea.

He then accused me of never supporting his relationship and told me if I wouldn't support his wedding then I might as well not come. I told him I might take him up on that as I don't support his attitude and maybe his own mother not wanting to come to his wedding will help him realise how ridiclous he's being about it. 

My sons has told the family about it, several people are on my side, my parents and sisters also think he's being impractical and overdramatic, my husband is refusing to get involved at all but my other son and daughter are angry at me and are telling me I'm acting like an asshole.",False,False,3,4,5,4,2,3,Loyalty

My wife went down from 180 pounds to 140 pounds. I went down from 220 to 190 pounds. my daughter who’s 5 feet went down from 140 pounds to 110 pounds.

i packed up all the leftovers and cake and distributed to our relatives who are less skilled in the kitchen or don’t have the time. i made four deliveries that night ( all within a few blocks). they were thrilled.

0,"AITA for banning my dad from my PhD defense? | My father is a very funny guy; everyone finds him hilarious and loves his jokes, but after 25+ years of it, I'm really over it. He's goofy all the time, and in recent years his personality has started changing, and the ""off"" switch to his goofiness has gotten to be a bit faulty. At times, he has started disregarding my wishes and acted inappropriately. We have brought these concerns to his doctors many times, but they insist it's ""normal.""  

I'm getting ready to defend my PhD this summer. I'm the first in my family to go to university, and my parents are incredibly excited even though they don't really understand it. They have spent the past 5 years talking about flying across the country to ""watch me become a doctor."" 

I only want my mother to come. My father came to 6 events that were important to me in undergrad and upset me at 3 of them. (1) He came to a presentation I was giving with a video camera. I told him I didn't want him to tape it as I was already very nervous, and he did so anyway. (2) He stood up at the end of my senior project to put a joke relating to the subject on the board in front of all my professors and other students. (3) He did me a very kind favor and drove me 5 hours to a last minute grad school visit (I was already admitted). He asked if he could sit in on a lecture, and then at the end of it, rushed to the board and did the same joke in front of the department chair who had lectured and all the students present. All three times, I knew he was going to do something, told him not to, and he did it anyway. When brought up at times after the fact, he would laugh. He still thinks the latter two were hilarious. I don't want it happening at my defense, and I don't want another thing to worry about on that day. 

I brought the idea of banning my dad up to my mother, and while she understands and will support me, she pointed out to me how many thousands of dollars he spent on my primary education, how he would work 10+ hour physical labor days while battling cancer and still come to every school performance or event that I had as a child, and how I'm their only child and this is a really harsh move.

1,"AITA for wanting a cash bar at our wedding? | Ok so me (f25) and my fiance (m24) are getting married next year and like many people our age we are pretty grossed out by the wedding industry and are trying to keep our wedding as cheap as possible.
So for example we are having the ceremony and reception at my uncle’s farm (free of charge) out in the country, my good friend from college who owns a catering business agreed to do our catering for free as a wedding gift, and my fiancé’s good friends with a band that will play at our wedding for free also as a wedding gift. We got my dress and his suit from Goodwill and got them altered. Everything said and done we will be paying less than $2k for our wedding. 

Now we get to the alcohol. We’re having a semi-big wedding (150 people - we have a ton of friends and family coming from all over) and the idea of paying for all of that booze is making us stressed out. It’d be at least $1k. We thought about it and decided to do a cash bar. We figured we could buy the booze and pay one of my cousins to be bartender for the night, and we realized we could probably recoup some of our costs on the other wedding expenses by charging moderate prices for drinks - win-win! We were set on this idea until I brought it up with one of my bridesmaids and she flipped out and said that would be incredibly tacky.

I was sort of taken aback by this. I’ve looked online and cash bars at weddings are pretty common. it seems ridiculous to pay to get everyone drunk.

0,"WIBTA if I refused to change my last name when getting remarried? | Names and details changed in this post for obvious reasons. This requires some backstory so I'll start there.

So for context, I was born as Jess Smith, and my name stayed that way until I was in my early twenties. Yada yada yada I fell in love and got married right out of college and as such I changed my name to match my husband's, for the sake of this post we'll say my name is now Jess Johnson.

Over the next twenty years, we stay married and have two beautiful girls, but eventually decide that we are unhappy together and it's best for everyone if we got a divorce. At the time our girls were 8 and 12 and they were going through so much that we decided I would keep my last name as Johnson to match theirs. We figured it would be easier for them to see me as they always had, and since I had primary custody it would be easier when it came to doctors, schools, etc.

That was around 12 years ago, and I have now been with my current SO for about 10 years. My name is still Johnson. My ex-husband and I still talk occasionally and get along decently (completely innocuous just talking about the kids), and he has since remarried and had more kids all with the last name Johnson. Don't think his wife likes me sharing the same last name as her, but we never interact and her behavior is not hostile.

So here's where we get to where I might be the asshole. My SO and I have been talking about finally getting married and moving in together now that our kids are grown and out of the house. And with that comes with the implication that I will take his last name.

But here's the thing... I really like my last name. I am in my 50s now and my name has been Johnson for the entirety of my adult life. It's the name I built my career around and had kids with. It is a part of my identity I connect with a lot. I realize I could just go back to Smith, but I am not close with my siblings and parents. I am, however, very close to my daughters and they are who I identify with as my family, and they are Johnsons. I am at the age where I'm not looking to build a new family. I love my SO but I don't know if I feel the obligation to change my name to his since we're already past middle-age. It doesn't help that the ""Johnson"" name in real life is a just really cool last name to have IMO.

I know my SO is more traditional though and won't be happy if I don't change my last name to his, I don't know if it will be a dealbreaker but it will definitely be a big fight. It will be drama with the in-laws and everyone who thinks they have the right to an opinion. And I can see how most people are not going to understand the logic of keeping my ex's last name, and they are going to see it as some weird devotion to him rather than to our children. But in my mind it's not just his name, it's our kids' names, and at this point it's my name.

Me (31 F) & kids (2 F, 4 M) moved with my husband  (31 M) from where we met, married & had our children in California to Texas. We always said we would raise our kids in small town Texas where my husband grew up. It was his dream & I was happy to support him!
When we moved – to a house a few blocks away from his parents – we thought we would be getting some help from his parents with the kids. They babysat the oldest twice in 8 months. They showed very little interest in the kids but had my husband over multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health) & did come over to dinner a few times. He adored his parents & they adored him. Their only child. Their golden boy. 

My husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer that was terminal earlier in the year. He died within 5 weeks of diagnosis. It was tragic & I am still in shock. When he was dying he was in a great deal of pain & on morphine & wasn’t always coherent or thinking straight. However he told me his parents were devastated I would move the kids back to where I grew up in Canada & they wouldn’t be able to watch the kids grow up. Well…that was my exact plan. My parents are the most amazing grandparents & help my sister out a lot (2 days a week of full babysitting!) & would do the same for me. Canada has a great education & healthcare system & my siblings & parents are live near each other so the kids and I would have a support network.

I lied to my husband. I told him I would stay & raise the kids as Texans as we had planned. He was in so much pain & distress & I couldn’t add to it. I chose the easy way out.

2 weeks after the funeral I moved my sweet babies home to Canada. My parents in law are now telling everyone I betrayed a dying man’s last wish. I have told them we will visit every year & they are welcome to visit us in Canada whenever they wish. They don’t care – they said I have broken their family.

I told him that I, simply, didn't care to have another sibling. I didn't feel like I would even be close to them, they would be 15yrs younger than me! But, I said do what you want, I probably just won't be showing up anymore anyways.

My sister in law is 30, and she married  my older brother last year. She happens to be half black and American
(we are British, it’s a real Meghan Markle situation). 

Yesterday, we had a barbecue for my cousin’s birthday. I was manning the grill with my grandpa. People were lining up and we were putting pieces of meat on their plates. It was my SIL’s turn, and my grandpa said, “You’ll love this fried chicken, we made it just for you,” and gives her a piece. I laugh a bit.

My SIL goes, “that’s very stupid and not funny at all” and rolls her eyes. I said, “It’s a joke, lighten up a bit.” She says, “It’s not funny, it’s offensive.” Then she leaves and my grandpa says something about how he didn’t mean to hurt her feelings.

Later my brother says to me, I shouldn’t have defended grandpa and I shouldn’t have laughed at his joke. I said, she shouldn’t have been rude, and she’s much too sensitive. I reminded him that my grandpa jokes around about my girlfriend too (she’s Russian), and she laughs along. So it’s rather hypocritical of her to laugh at jokes about my GF’s background when she herself can’t take a joke just because it pertains to her. Plus, I said, he’s 97 years old, he’s from a different generation and we just have to cut him some slack.

1,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend (18f) to go to frat parties without me (19m). | Me and my girlfriend are freshmen in college and although we've only been together four months we're moving quite fast and things have been very serious for at least three of those months. I'm not in a frat and my girlfriend isn't in a sorority but she has friends in sororities and occasionally gets invited to frat parties with them,

I have always held that she's free to go to such parties with her friends, but I'm clearly very uncomfortable with it so she has respected my wishes (despite me telling her to go) and not gone to any since we've been together.

Recently though this is putting some strain on out relationship because she very much wants to go to these parties but I can't look her in the eye and say I'm okay with her going. This in turn has made me feel very much like an asshole because I'm in effect keeping her from having fun with her friends.

The thing I can't get over though is what she's gonna enjoy at these parties because although she'll go with her friends, I very much know that once you get there it's literally just dancing - grinding on random dudes - and occasionally hooking up with frat guys. Now I'm secure enough in our relationship that I don't think there's the slightest chance she'd hook up with a frat guy (at least not by choice), but it's basically inevitable that she'll be dancing on some guys as that's literally all there is to do there and it very much makes me uncomfortable. 

Also, she doesn't drink either so it's not just the fun of going out getting drunk with friends, maybe I'm missing something but I really don't see what she could possibly enjoy out of it other than dancing on other guys which doesn't make sense to me since she seems to be very much in love with me and we're very much exclusive.

TLDR: My girlfriend wants to go to frat parties with her friends. This makes me uncomfortable as I don't see what the parties have to offer other than grinding on dudes.

From the ages of 20 to 25, he dated his previous GF. She broke up with him due to work and busy lives. That was her official excuse, but he told me that she was just “really afraid of settling down with me”. From what I gathered, she was his first love.

6 months after they broke up, we started dating. At first I was apprehensive because his ex was this beautiful, gorgeous model. I voiced my insecurities to my BF, but he promised me that he was ready to put her in the past. We even attended her wedding recently. He was emotional and even tearing up, but nearly every guest was.

My BF  has a large walk in closet with his things. When I moved in, he let me use the spare room as a closet because his closet was full. My BF is pretty neat but his closet gets messy fast. Due to work (and the weekly housekeeper being sick) he has no time to clean it, so I decided to clean it myself.

He’s never explicitly told me not to go inside his closet. I’ve been inside a few times, but mostly I have no reason to. Anyways, I got to organizing, and when I opened a drawer, I noticed a shoe box. It was pretty light for shoes so I opened it and found a nearly empty bottle of perfume, an old iPhone 4 with a cracked screen, a single mitten, and a lock of dark wavy hair.

The phone was nearly fully charged and could turn on. There was a passcode and the background image was a picture of a dog, which I recognized to be my BF’s dog that his ex GF gifted him. And the hair was probably hers too. I had never felt more betrayed in my life. I took the phone out, put the box in a bag, and threw it down the trash chute.

When my BF came home, I confronted him by showing him the phone. He looked bewildered and I told him how I found it. I asked him why she still had his ex’s phone. He told me that he had bought her the latest iphone one year for her birthday, so she no longer used the old phone, and he kept it instead. He admitted. to charging it periodically, said he didnt want to “lose any of the old photos of my dog and stuff”. Bullshit, iCloud exists.

Anyways he asked me where the box is. I told him the rest looked like trash so I threw it out. He was livid. He yelled at me and said I had no business throwing out his belongings. I told him, “they’re not yours. They’re your ex-girlfriend’s.”

I told him I deserved an explanation as to why he still kept his ex’s shit. Evidently he keeps going back to the box because the phone is 65% charged and its an old IPHONE.

0,"AITA for playing a small prank at my brother's wedding? | This is the background to the prank:

When my brother was getting ready for his Bar Mitzvah, my dad went way overboard with the guest list. The first draft of the list included ""Bob"" a man my brother and I never heard of. It turned out that Bob was our aunt's (by marriage) late mother's widower. None of us had ever met Bob, and we had only met my aunt's mother a couple of times, so we convinced my dad not to invite Bob.

Bob became a family joke after that. We would joke about inviting Bob to parties because he's our favorite relative, or saying things like how popular an event was and that even Uncle Bob was there. This joke still comes up from time to time, and we made the joke when planning my brother's wedding. My brother said Uncle Bob had to be invited because he was my brother's favorite uncle. It's a dumb joke, but it always made my family laugh.

As a joke during the wedding, I signed the guest book ""It was a pleasure attending your wedding. I wish you every happiness. Sincerely, Uncle Bob."" I wasn't sure if my sister-in-law knew about Bob but I figured either my brother would explain it and she would find it funny too, or she would just think Bob was a distant relative and not care.

Several weeks after the wedding, my parents and I got an angry text from my brother demanding to know who had written Bob's message in the guest book. I admitted to it, and he said he and my sister-in-law were really mad at me for ruining the guest book with a joke. I said I wasn't trying to ruin the book, and that I thought my brother liked the Bob joke. He said he did like the joke, but that it was only appropriate to talk about it, not to wreck the guest book. 

I did apologize because I don't want a fight, but I was curious if other people thought I was an asshole. I honestly never thought anyone would be offended, because anyone who saw the message would either get the reference or not notice anything unusual. I didn't think I would be ruining the guest book.",False,False,2,2,3,2,1,3,Loyalty|Proportionality
0,"AITA for not supporting my friend's online boutique? | My friend out of nowhere opened this online boutique. She considers herself a small beauty influencer but she has less than 100 subscribers and her quality is honestly kind of crap. All of her posts contain major spelling errors and it drives me nuts. 

So anyway, she opened this online boutique and is selling logo shirts and jewelry but wouldn't tell me where she got jewelry from. I don't want to buy any of her stuff because I don't like the logo on her logo shirts and I'm honestly afraid of where this jewelry is coming from. I have sensitive skin and don't use cheap jewelry out of fear that it will irritate my skin. She's selling the jewelry at prices between $10-$15 so if she's making a profit from it I can only imagine the kind of quality it is. She expects me to buy her products but also wants me to post about her shop on my own social media and promote her which I don't feel comfortable doing because I don't feel like the quality is there and I don't want to recommend it to others.

She also is talking about going from FT to PT at her job so she can have more time for her ""business."" She's already living paycheck to paycheck and barely getting by.

Here's the story. We're group of 5 visiting Bangkok right now. I'm the pushover one so when they planned the trip duration and everything, I didn't voice my ideas and let them decide so whenever I raise my voice, other will reject it. So, at the end, we have 5 days in Bangkok alone which is very long for this boring city. 

Since they're kinda into shopping, everyday is shopping for them and I'm getting tired and said i was so bored of it. They spent almost of their money on shopping and eating so no budget left for tours or anything fun. 

Anyway, this just happened. Today is the 4th day in Bangkok and since they either have everything they want to shop or running out of money, we decided to go to museum and a pagoda today. However, last night they partied hard and woke up very late so we only started at 12.00 after lunch. After the meal, they said that we should go to the museum first because of the closing time and not so sure if the museum we aimed to do open today (it's Sunday here). I told them to check and some of them said it's close so off we went to the Pagoda. 

After coming back from the pagoda, they said they want to go eating dessert. I was full since it's only 2 or 3 hours after we had lunch so I told them I would walk back to the hotel. The thing is that the museum is on my way of walking back and I saw it's still open so I walked in and visited it myself.  After like 2.5 hours, I came back and saw no one there at the hotel yet. I opened my phone (I dont buy myself 4g sim card, only 3 of my friends did) and they have been sending the text that the museum does open and waiting for me to go. However, when i told them I've been to that already, they pissed and told me I'm the AH since they're waiting for me and I didn't wait for them. 

Actually, I don't see any problem since they were out doing thing they like which is eating. Me just wanted time for myself alone and walking back and happened to see the museum by myself is now being called AH. So, what do you guys think? AITA?",False,False,2,3,4,1,1,3,Loyalty

My parents supported me until the age of 18 when I got a job. Now, I only live with them, and everything else I pay for myself (uni, bus passes, food, etc). My parents are about 100K or so in debt and it just keeps rising.

1,"AITA for forcing my socially anxious fiancee to have a wedding? | I’ve always been really family-oriented. I’m pretty guarded but I get sentimental about anything to do with marriage or families, even in movies. I’ve been a groomsman a couple times and kept thinking about how great my turn is going to be. Telling your wife that you love her and will care for her forever in front of all of your friends and family is really meaningful to me and a memory I want. My fiancee is aware of this.

My fiancee has anxiety. She’s pretty good at recognizing it and being rational about it even though anxiety definitely bothers her and very obviously affects her behavior. Once we had to go to two of my coworkers’ parties in a row and she spent the second one pretty much hiding until we could leave. She quit therapy after a year because it was expensive and she didn’t think it was helping. She has a take-as-needed medication that helps some.

Even though I wanted a big wedding I was prepared for a medium wedding with just people she knows well. However, she clearly doesn’t want a wedding at all and is just going through the motions for me. She was really quiet when we were visiting venues and I ended up just picking one myself. She hasn’t been involved in anything else about the wedding, which is frustrating because I wanted to share that experience with her but our families and I are handling it. I’ve been telling people that she’s too busy at work to get involved. I asked her if she really wants to get married and she said she does but wants to elope.

She’s clearly going to hate this wedding and she gets sad and distant and a little passive aggressive when I talk to her about stuff like my bachelor party (the bridesmaids are relatives she isn't close to). I want to give up sometimes but I think about standing at the alter with her and making those memories with my family and friends and it’s worth it. My mom and I had a pretty deep talk while looking at videographers and it was a really great moment in our relationship.

One thing Mark quickly realized about me is when i get stressed or when i get super anxious, to calm myself down, i just have an orgasm. I'm not joking. It's the best stress reliever for me, it doesnt hurt anyone and i am less stressed and can then handle whatever is bothering me. I'm just more levelheaded. 

Anyway, everything has been going well and recently, he just bought a house with a few acres. He decided to have a house warming party after he was all moved in and invited his extended family over to see it. He did tell me beforehand that they would be alot of ppl there but nothing prepared me for the sheer amount of family he has. I would say maybe 70 to 80 ppl were there which was fine cuz it was a warm day, people mostly stayed in the backyard and they were there to celebrate.

Before this party, the only family members i had met before were Mark's mom and dad. Though everyone was really nice, what made it nerveracking were the amount of people asking me questions. For ex, how long have u been together, do u think youll move in, how did u meet, what do u do. I understand these are normal questions to ask the SO of a family member when meeting them but it was literally neverending. When i moved to a different area of the house, more people were there to ask me more questions. Tbh, i was getting so anxious about who would ask the next question that i literally was starting to look for an excuse to leave the party. I was getting frazzled so when Mark asked me if i could go get some more alcohol from the store cuz i hadnt been drinking, i jumped at the chance to escape for a little while. 

I told him i would also stop by my apartment since it was close to the store to get a few extra bottles of wine i had. I got the alcohol and then went to my house to get the wine. While i was there, i decided to have some stress relief which calmed me down and then went back to the party with the alcohol. Mark immediately could tell a difference in my demeanor and how relaxed i was and he got pissed.

He obviously realized what happened but i told him that it wasnt that i didnt like his family. It was just overwhelming with the asking and doing that just calmed me down enough that even though the questions were still coming, i wasnt as stressed about it. I even stayed to one area, which limited the amount of ppl who i was talking too. He is still very mad at me. He thinks what i did means that i can't take being around his family.

A few years ago my parents moved into my dads childhood home so “home” isn’t home to me anymore. It’s also very packed full of things and clutter. The walls are paper thin, there is a big, rowdy dog and more recently a new puppy. My bf and I are not allowed to sleep in the same room (Whatever, we don’t really mind, but it’s a factor). He sleeps on a couch and I sleep on a stiff mattress. My parents stay up later than us so we don’t sleep well because we can hear the TV and then talking. We are also woken up very early in the morning when the dogs want out, and I’m typically the one to get up and let them out because I can’t stand them whining and my parents hushing them. Neither of us sleep well there and the clutter really stresses me out, not what I want on a weekend after a stressful work week.

My aunt and uncle live about 15 minutes away on top of a mountain in a huge house with an entire living space downstairs, complete with bedrooms, a kitchen, tv and incredible jacuzzi tub. They don’t give a fuck about us sleeping together and we use the kitchen to cook our own food and continue our regular routines. He has a special diet so this is unbelievably helpful and allows us to not only eat how we want but to also avoid having to turn down homemade food because of his diet. The rooms are pitch black and we sleep HARD and for as long as we want, as it’s also silent.

The plan is to stay there, eat breakfast then spend most of the day with my parents, return for the evening and repeat. My brother (17) also intends on staying there so we can all hang out. 

My brother told me this hurts our parents’ feelings. I don’t intend on changing plans, staying with my aunt and uncle is damn near a vacation and gives us quality time with more people in my family. However, if I’m being insensitive and an asshole towards my parents I will sacrifice it in order to change that. I’m also looking for insightful ways to express to my parents our reasoning.

He proposed over Easter weekend last year and we were well into wedding planning for this summer. 

We took a trip to Hawaii over his Christmas holiday vacation and we were having a great time. I have no idea why but there was an interaction he had with a waiter where Lenny just seemed like such a weakling, it's hard to explain why it bothered me so much but it was like and instantaneous wave over my body that said ""I really don't love him."" I faked it through the next 5 days of the vacation but after getting settled in a home I very flatly told him I no longer loved him and I did not want to get married. I do feel bad but it looked like he'd been shot. 

We went through all he standard breakup stuff of him wanting an explanation, wanting to get back together, go to counseling, etc... I did not want any of this stuff. In the background pretty much everyone from our common friends to my own parents and siblings think I'm some sort of awful witch who has started taking drugs. No one will listen that I just don't love him anymore. The worst part about this is that I feel very isolated from everyone I thought I could trust. 


I have started dating quite a bit and Lenny thinks this is probably proof that I was cheating on him which isn't true at all but since his word is gold and mine is dog shit at this point, it's further poisoned the well with my friends and family. 


tl;dr: I fell out of love with my fiancé and cancelled the wedding. Pretty much everyone I thought was friends or family has abandoned me. Happy to provide any info if needed.

1,"AITA for telling my step aunt that her “parents” are not her real parents? | My mom married my stepdad when I was 5. We would visit his parents every five years or so. My step grandmother had 4 children with her first husband.

When she got remarried, my stepdad and his brother were both in their late teens so they remember this situation very well. Since I wasn’t there, I will tell you the story from their POV.

When my stepdad was about 17, his little sister who was 15 at the time, got pregnant. My stepdad clearly remembers her being pregnant. Very early into the pregnancy, my stepdads sister was “sent away” and about 7 months later, she reappeared and magically my step grandmother had a newborn baby with her new husband. From the moment that happened, obviously everyone knew that my step aunt had had a baby and given it to my step grandparents. But no one ever wanted to rock the boat and confront them. Also, years later my aunt who had the baby wrote a letter to her other brother detailing what had happened and how sad she was about it. So there is no doubt that she gave the baby to my step grandparents.

That child became what I knew to be my step aunt who was only about 7 years older than me. In reality, she was my step cousin. I along with my siblings, cousins, everyone from that side of the family, grew up knowing the truth. Except for her. 

Fast forward to 2008. I moved to NYC. My step aunt happened to also move to NYC a year or so after me. We had never been super close due to the geographic distance between our families but my parents encouraged me to text her and hang out due to being in the same city and also being so close in age. We instantly bonded. We had the same interest, the same sense of humor and rapidly became very good friends. Friends more than family. We hung out with each other weekly for the next 6 years. All along, I knew this deep, dark, horrible secret but I could never bring myself to tell her because I didn’t know what it would do to her.

In 2015, I left NYC and moved to Florida where she had grown up and where my step grandparents resided. We also were not super close but due to my extremely close friendship with my step aunt, they started inviting me over frequently. 

In January of this year, I was talking with my step aunt on the phone. We stayed close even though I had moved away and would text or chat often. I finally decided that I had had enough of the lies and that if no one else in the family was going to tell her what we all knew, that I was going to do it, because she was my friend. My parents and close family from that side all supported what I had done and even spoke to my step aunt to back up what I had told her with more detail. 

My step aunt on the other hand was enraged. She called me a liar and told me that what I did was beyond hurtful. My step grandfather also called me a liar and asked why I wanted to hurt the family so much.

Needless to say, I haven’t heard from my aunt or her parents since this happened. And I keep asking myself if I did the right thing.

0,"AITA for moving out to live with my aunts? | I am fifteen. Five years ago, my parents died in car accident and since then, I’ve been living with my grandparents (my mom’s parents). I am very thankful I was able to live with them. I love them dearly and we are quite close.

Over the summer, I spent a month with my aunts (my dad’s sisters). When my parents died, they wanted to take me in, but I ended up living with my grandparents instead. My aunts still visited me a lot, and I visited them a lot, but this summer was the first time I stayed with them for a month straight. 

I did a lot of stuff while visiting my aunts. One of them gave me a job at her bakery, and I loved helping and earning money. They taught me to drive, which my grandparents said I couldn’t do until I turn 18. I also started dating a guy who will be going to the local high school. I visited the high school and I loved it, it was so much bigger than the tiny school I went to last year near my grandparents, with a lot more class options and AP courses and extracurriculars. I also felt like I got to know my aunts a lot better, and they told me a lot of stories about my dad which I never knew before. 

My aunts always told me that their door is always open for me, and that I’m welcome any time. I told them that I wanted to move in with them, and they were thrilled. Then I told my grandparents and they were not thrilled, they seemed really upset. I didn’t really think about what it would mean for them if I moved out. I honestly thought it would just take off a burden from them, I didn’t think they would react as sadly as they did, and I feel awful for not even talking it over with them first, just telling them I want to move out, and thinking harder about it, I’m seeing that some of the reasons I wanted to move are kind of stupid. 

I’m worried that my grandparents feel threatened by my aunts or something. Since they’re from different sides, they don’t really know each other, I’m the only connection.

I am a 23M with a long-term GF (23F). We have plans of getting a house in a different part of the country (where are better job offers) and getting married. However, my parents (70 and 71) really want me to stay with them. We have a big house where can two families live without any issues and they are pouring a lot of money and time into renovating it so I can stay living with them. They invested tens of thousands of dollars into renovating it, so they would make it livable for two families even though I have been saying for many years that I want to move out.

Every time I say it, they either ignore it or they say how dumb it would be to buy a house even though I already have one or they say how ungrateful son I am for not wanting to take care of them after everything they did for me (they paid for my university, bought me a car etc..). Sometimes they even say it's my GF's idea and that I would happily live with them if it wasn't for her.

Honestly, I love my parents and they did a lot for me, but I can't imagine living with them. We are just too different and we constantly argue about something. Sometimes it's really bad for my mental health, arguing so much. On the other hand, I know that they are old and they do need help. Even when I move out, I plan to help them and visit them regularly, I just can't do living with them.

1,"AITA for not wanting my daughter to learn Chinese along with her stepsibs from her step-mother? | I know the title makes me sound like an asshole and maybe I am. This is why I’m asking here. 

So my ex and I split 5 years ago. We have a 12 year old daughter together. I have custody but she spends her summers with her dad and his new wife (married 5 months ago). She now has two step sisters (teens) as well.

While I’m on okayish terms with my ex I do not get along with his wife at all, for reasons I’d rather not blather on about here. Anyways the issue is this: she’s half Chinese and is teaching her daughters Chinese during the summers. When my daughter lived there these past few months, she’s been learning alongside them. 

I’ve tolerated it in the beginning but it’s become something that’s grown to bother me a lot. For one thing, my daughter has been learning Spanish since she was in 2nd grade. She now wants to drop this language altogether for Chinese (they offer this class starting in 7th grade) as soon as she can. This really bothers me because I speak Spanish fluently (learned in schools, not native) and I was looking forward to sharing this language with her.

She now wants to chat in broken Chinese to her step sisters who she looks up to because they’re “cool teenaged girls” who go to parties and all that. Which makes me think this is all just a phase. Furthermore I just don’t think Chinese should take over the Spanish she’s been learning already. We live in Georgia. Spanish will be FAR more useful to her here than Chinese ever will. 

I haven’t outright forbid her from learning but I have been vocal in my disappointment. My daughter apparently told her step sisters and my ex as well, and now he’s furious at me for “driving a wedge between her and everyone else because I’m jealous.” I’m not jealous at all, but I feel like no one else really gets where I’m coming from and thinks it’s a non-issue.

I figured I'd try to get that out of the way. I am not English or American so I am sorry for any mistakes.

Now I am 22M and I have two ""Blood"" siblings who we'll call Jack(24M) and Jane(25F).

Now my parents pretty much suffered from empty nest syndrome when all of us moved out, first my brother when he was 18 to go off to Uni, followed by my sister at 21 to live with her boyfriend in another city and finally I moved out 3 years ago at 19 also to go to Uni, my mom was literally inconsolable for the first month when I moved out and would often make little jabs at all three of us for ditching them when in reality we all just grew up and are in active contact with them.

Now it is very relevant to add that the Uni I go to is pretty mych on the other side of the country resulting in me not being able to visit my parents regularly and I basically only visit them twice a year at most and they visit me a few times a year as well, but it is not often purely because of the distance.

2 years ago my parents informed me they were going to be fostering a girl and apparantly already went ahead with their plans and wanted to surprise us with the great news, my brother was the first to state the obvious that they were both in to their 50's and adopting a toddler was simply not a good idea, I said I was happy for them but stated the same worries, I mean the moment she would be 18 they would nearing 70 and who is to say they'll be in good health at that point?

Well they went ahead with it and about a year of having her they formalized it and adopted her legally

Well, I have seen her a few times these past 2 years, But I have no relationship with her, I am pretty shitty with kids to begin with add to that the fact I rarely see her, it is not exactly a good formula to create a sibling relationship, my brother feels the same as he also lives far from our parents. Only our sister sees her more regularly.

Now with the things going on my parents have been calling far more often and after a while of this my mom seemed aggitated at me, when I asked her why she said she was annoyed that I never ask to speak to my sister so I told her I am not sure what to discuss with a 6 year old.

When I think about it we're just not close, I mean I get my parents love her and want her to get the full sibling experience but  it just doesn't feel the same to me as it does with my brother and sister as we grew up together and all, she is if I am going to be blunt a 6 year old that I see once in a while if that makes sense yet I feel incredibly guilty about it as obviously she can't help it at all, I just feel this entire situation is mostly awkward and I am not sure what to even do, I can't force brotherly feelings to appear out of thin air.

1,"AITA for uninviting my girlfriend from a family vacation? | Some background:

My girlfriend and I have been going steady for about 2 years now. In that time, our relationship has become long distance because of my decision to work in a city multiple hours away, requiring half a day of driving to get there. As a result, we see eachother maybe once every two weeks to once a month at most. The nature of my work also means that I rarely get take any vacation time, and sometimes when my girlfriend visits I have to work for some of the time she is there.

Normally, this is no issue; we found a way to make it work. This particular time, some cousins of mine with whom I've been close with are here visiting my homecountry for the second time in their lives (10 years since the last time). 

Main story:

This past weekend, my girlfriend has been with us the whole time and coming out with us, so it was no issue. Now, weeks before they came, I planned to take them around my country to visit other cities multiple hours away. I asked my girlfriend to come along and be with us during these travels, but this morning I was asked by my cousins not to bring my girlfriend along because she ""changes the dynamic of the group."" I strongly disagree with this and want her with us, but it is my cousin's vacation so I asked my girlfriend if she would be ok with not coming. Obviously, she is devastated because we rarely get to see eachother and she was really looking forward to the vacation, but now she has lost the opportunity to come with us. She booked time off work for this, though it can be easily reversed and most of the investment has been emotional. 

I'm torn because I want to have her there and I rarely get to see her as it is, but I feel like I owe it to my cousins who are visiting to give them what they want. I also understand their point of view because when I visit them, they put their social life aside for me, though their relationships aren't long distance like mine. They hold no ill will to my girlfriend, but want us to be alone. Before they told me they want to spend time alone, I promised my girlfriend that everyone would get along, that we would all have a good time together and actively encouraged her to come. 

My girlfriend is hurt and upset at them, and is asking for me to somehow make up for the time lost between us before the end of summer by going on a separate other mini-vacation later on. This is really demanding for me as my girlfriend and I went on a 2 week vacation together earlier this summer and now with my cousins I am taking even more time off. A second vacation is going to be costly both financially and to my work. I am asking her to ""let it go"" this time, and to see the other perspective even if it is unfair to her, but she is incredibly upset about the time lost together because she was looking forward to coming and because now she won't  get to see me for another few weeks.

The only actual couple interaction we have had is at his brother's wedding where he introduced me as his wife. 

 I asked him about it and he told me that he hasn't told anyone becuase he doesnt want any backlash coming on to me or him from his ex or any of her friends at work.

I work for a small, family-owned business (my family). I've been there for over 7 years now, through ups and downs, from the floor to an office I share with the management types of the business. Things are extremely on the thin side right now, some of which was caused by my brother's management, but that's not part of this story. If we can get through the next little while, few months or so, things should be going extremely well for everyone involved. I'm salaried and have been going in at 7:30-7:45am consistently for the past four or so years, working late if they need me, generally trying to be as supportive as I can, because, family. I'm not saying I'm a model employee, I'm not. I make my fair share of mistakes, I'm not always motivated or disciplined, but the job that I do is one that only I can do, so I tend to be the first one overloaded.

Since Thursday, my in-laws have been staying at my house. I love these people - they're fun to be around, love to spend time together playing cards or cooking, my father-in-law is a whiskey guy and we always try to split a bottle when we get together. They live around 800 miles from my wife and I, so we don't see each other often, but when we do we try to make the most of the time we have, maybe a week at a shot 2-3 times a year. They're even kind enough to let us stay with them in Florida when they go on vacation - certainly people I'd like to keep on my good side.

All of this is leading up to this afternoon - I got a message from one of my coworkers, a guy I genuinely like, informing me we have a meeting at 6:30am Monday morning that, quote, ""Isn't really optional"". Now I'm not sure if this is a midwest thing, or just how I was raised, but we take goodbyes very seriously. It's considered rude to leave without saying goodbye, and even more rude to not be available if your guests are leaving. They're leaving tomorrow morning, right about the time I'd be in the middle of my meeting - something I personally don't find acceptable. The more I think about it, it comes down to the fact I wasn't informed about it until this afternoon - If I would have known about it Thursday or Friday, I could have planned for this and at least made a point of apologizing and trying to figure out how to make it work. I guess to me it feels like they're not respecting me or my family's time, since none of the other three that will be there have significant others or any sort of other demands on their time. I've been digging in my heels and generally raising a stink, because again - I have family and guests to think about. I need more than 18 hours of heads up to change plans. I realize this may seem super petty, but I'm really trying to get these people to understand how much their lack of planning causes issues for me.

I have to skip my best friend’s 30th birthday dinner for that so now she’s angry at me.

A few months back my best friend asked over group chat if I and our other friends have anything scheduled on the weekend of her birthday because she wants to have a dinner party. Everyone said they’re free so far, but other details were never finalized and she never said anything else about it after that so I didn’t think much of it.

Girlfriend asked me last week if I wanted to go as her plus one to her friend’s wedding and I said yes. The next day my best friend messaged me reminding me of her birthday dinner this weekend. I said I didn’t know she was going through with the dinner and I already said yes to going with girlfriend to her friend’s wedding, so I can’t go to best friend’s dinner. 

Best friend said she never said it was postponed so why did I assume that she wasn’t going through with it. She said it’s hard to coordinate everyone’s schedule and everyone else is free this weekend so she hoped I would go. I said I’m sorry I assumed wrong but again I already said yes to girlfriend.

Best friend said she gets it and to have fun at the wedding. I said thanks and promised to make it up to her and our other friends. But later that night she messaged me and said she’s been thinking about it the whole night and she tried to understand but she can’t get over the fact that I chose a girl I’ve been dating for a month over people I’ve been friends with for years. 

I told her I’m not choosing girlfriend over them, it’s just that girlfriend invited me to a finalized event first. Best friend said the wedding is full of people who don’t know me and won’t care if I’m there or not, while it is her birthday and the dinner is with people who’ve been friends with me for 10 years and will miss something if I’m not there. She said she’s always been there for me and the one time she asks me to be there for her I put a person I barely knew first and she doesn’t know if she can get past that. 

I tried calling and messaging her but she blocked me. We used to talk every day but she hasn’t said a word to me in three days. Our other friends don’t seem to know what’s going on and will go to her dinner as far as I can tell from our group chat. 

She’s my best friend and I don’t want her to be hurt but on the other hand I feel like she's overreacting. She knows my girlfriend is very important to me too, and even though we’ve known each other for just two months, I have very strong feelings for her and can see a future with her.

Hey Reddit,

We were in a town \~30 minutes away from our home when he was arrested. The officer asked if I was a licensed driver and for all of my info, and told me I should go home as he was going to jail. I did just that, and began looking up what i needed to do next. I was home 10 minutes when he called and told me, i needed to bring a $500 money order to the jail to get him out. I did just that, and was at the jail within 40 minutes of the call. I get there and wait about 10 minutes before someone comes to help me, they tell me what to fill out on the money order and their paperwork, I do all that and they say they will let me know when the MO is approved as valid. 30 minutes later they tell me they are stating the release process, they don't know how long it will take. I then sat in the waiting room for 1.5 hours before a guard and two inmates came in to clean, He advised me to go home as it would be anywhere from 4 - 8 hours before he was released.

I did not go home, I sat in my car for another two hours until he was released. I told him I was so sorry that happened, I can't believe how much it sucked for him here is your phone, wallet, and cigarettes. We hit a drive through and went home. He told me thanks for coming to get him. I went to bed at 3:30 am.

Today, we are just doing our own things, hanging out relaxing, not doing much. At \~5 he asks if I want to go do socially distant outdoor activity with him and our kid, or maybe just part of it, then split off from the two of them. I say sure that sounds good. a few minutes later, he asked me who all did you tell? I need to know. I answered ""no one"" He then asks if I got gas in the car, I said yes.

The next question is why I went home and didn't follow the cop car. I told him, I didn't know what to do, I came home and started researching what to do. He lets me know it is common for wives or buddies to follow the cop to the jail. That I should know this because my dad has gone to jail. I tell him I have never bailed anyone out of jail. I didn't know what to do, nor did I have enough money on me to bail him out. He tells me, it hurt his feelings that I went home, I told him I am sorry but I just didn't know what to do. He told me you have watched enough cop shows on tv to know what to do. We go back and forth for a while, with him telling me I am giving him excuses. I am XX years old and should know what to do.

The excuses include I didn't know what to do, I didn't have $500 with me, The arresting officer told me to go home, I didn't know he would get out that same night. And at least one other i can't remember right now. I will edit if i do remember.

I considered telling her that I was already with someone, but I found it kind of fun to relive my days as a single man for a brief period, also, something like this has never happened to me before so it was quite exhilarating. After a couple of minutes she asked to exchange numbers which I did to keep up the illusion. We said goodbye and later that day she texted me, so I replied saying that I was already with someone and that I was sorry for misleading her. I also said she was very pretty, and if I was single I would have asked her out in an attempt not to hurt her feelings.

I barely know these people. She also insisted I invite my step siblings to my wedding. Both parents always put a lot of energy into making their newest family members comfortable and happy, while I feel overlooked and disconnected and on the outside looking in.

I am tired of this charade. My parents are on their respective third “families” now - you can’t just reset and start over and tell me this is my new family, these people are strangers to me. I am thinking about just not talking to them anymore, cutting contact and moving on and stopping coming home. I hate this lifestyle of replaceable family. My parents have not done anything mean to me, but I feel like an outsider. 

TLDR; parents are each in third marriages, which makes me feel like an outsider in their lives and like they think family is disposable. AITA if I just stop communicating with them and stop coming home?",False,False,4,3,5,2,2,3,Loyalty
1,"WIBTA for removing myself from my ex step daughter’s life? | I was married to my ex husband for seven years before we divorced.  He had a daughter from a previous relationship who was 12 at the time.  In the beginning we had a very strained relationship understandably, but she grew to like me eventually.  For whatever reason though I just never felt all that much of a connection to her on my part though, despite my best efforts at it.  I always outwardly showed her love and kindness.  I always thought that it might be a “fake it until you make it” kind of thing so I just kept the act up hoping one day it would become real for me.  It never really did though.  

Now that her father and I are no longer together I’m in an awkward position.  She stays in touch often.  She texts multiple times a week and is constantly trying to arrange spending time together.  I’m still pretty raw about my divorce and these interactions really are just a reminder of him and nothing more.  I’m just getting nothing out of them emotionally besides painful reminders. 

If she was a child I might try to keep up the act, but she’s an adult now.  I’ve started making excuses not to get together with her and have become as distant as possible through texts.  Giving only the bare minimum answers or outright ignoring some.  I don’t really want to be brutally honest with her since she’s done nothing wrong in all this.  So I’m just doing a slow back step out of her life.  ",False,False,3,2,4,1,1,3,Loyalty
1,"AITA for not letting my son call his bio mom's son his ""brother""? | My husband and I adopted our son as an infant. It's always been an open adoption, exchanging regular pictures and letters and stuff like that. Once our son turned 13, he started having more one-on-one contact with his bio mom. They text regularly, and they've hung out in person many times. My son is now 16, so their relationship has only gotten closer over the last three years.

His bio mom got married two years ago, and last year had a son with her husband. Last week, for the first time, my son went and visited his bio mom along with her husband and baby. They went to an amusement park, and apparently had a good time. 

When he got home, my son kept talking about how cute his ""brother"" was, and how much he enjoyed meeting him. Eventually, I snapped and told him that he shouldn't call the baby his ""brother,"" since that implies that they share a parent, which they don't. His bio mom isn't his mom, I am. 

I understand that it's important for him to maintain a friendship with his bio mom, but that's exactly what it is – friendship. They're not his family, so it's inappropriate for him to refer to the baby that way. 

My son is now furious with me, and my husband refuses to give his opinion on the matter.

0,"AITA for not giving weed to my wife's best friend... | This is a fairly straightforward situation:

I'm from Toronto, Canada, and weed here is legal and easy to get. I always have a stash of a few varieties on hand, and I smoke  on the weekend only.

My wife tends to be mostly agreeable... Over the last year, we've had friends over to hang out, and I happily share my bud with my friends and we have a great time.

0,"AITA for euthanizing my dog for a possibly curable issue? | On Wednesday morning I put my dog down voluntarily. Just four months ago another family dog had to be put down after struggling for months to try and treat his terminal cancer, which put me and my lower class family out $3,500 ish that we didn’t really have. He was not my personal dog, though we all loved him. After watching his long, overly drawn out struggle I decided and agreed with my family that if either of my two girls got anything terminal and detrimental I would not pursue treatment. Anything minor we would treat it, but anything SERIOUS would be euthanasia. In all reality, I didn’t realize I’d have to make that call so soon.

Roughly two weeks ago, she dropped weight rapidly. A huge amount all the sudden. At first I thought it was because she was extremely old, but then I realized she was moving around less and having some trouble staying balanced. Everyone was a little worried so we decided to gather a few funds and then take her in for a check up.

On Tuesday night everything deteriorated. She suddenly was falling over and, once I actually saw it happen myself, I recognized it as a seizure. She began chugging water but then began to throw it up soon after.

The vet ran tests and it came back that not only had she developed diabetes, but she had gone into serious ketoacidosis. He said that a normal glucose level was 100, hers was 545. He explained that she had probably been diabetic for awhile and we just didn’t notice. The weight loss was her body breaking down fat to produce insulin, and the sudden severe illness was because her body was now attacking her organs for the same purpose.

I can’t even remember how I did the math, but the total just for the initial phase was somewhere in the ballpark of $2,000, then the monitoring would be up to $160, and then the annual cost. When I asked him how long she could have left, he asked me once more how old she was. She was anywhere from 13-17, not exactly sure. When I said that his response was “then she should have been dead five years ago”. There was a chance she could survive, but no promises. 

After about an hour and a half at the vet, I made the final call to euthanize her without trying to stabilize.

I’m struggling here. This is not the first pet I’ve taken to be euthanized, but it’s the first one where I was the sole decision maker. This would also not have been my first choice for pet I had to decide on. Her and my other dog have been a bonded pair for 5+ years now, and my still living girl is struggling. She looks for her and has already started moving around less. She is 13 years old herself with a lot of health issues and I worry this is a death sentence for her too. This dog was also my best friends dog before she died a few years ago.

K’s 14 year old dog died recently, and she made some posts about it on facebook and what not, and for the most part it seemed to me like she was handling it with a pretty level head. She has owned many dogs as long as I’ve known her — I think I’ve outlived like 6 or 7 dogs she’s owned so far. 2 or 3 weeks after her dog passed, she posted this article to her facebook timeline, and wrote the caption “I believe this...”

https://awarenessact.com/cann-our-pets-see-spirits-science-confirms-that-cats-and-dogs-can-see-spirits-and-frequencies-that-humans-cannot-paranormal/

TL;DR:
The article is titled “Science Confirms That Cats and Dogs Can See ‘Spirits’ And Other Frequencies We Can’t”.
The author presents an *actual* science article showing that some animals can see frequencies that human’s can’t and then disingenuously concludes that this means animals can see spirits.

Anyways, I’m a scientist, and seeing people spreading fake science, especially with deliberately false titles like this one, triggers the everliving fuck out of me. I believe it’s actually damaging to human progress that shit like this is so frequently bought and spread like wildfire. 

So I commented:

“Lol K! The title of this article is a straight up lie 😂

They even say in the article ‘While this study itself was not on whether animals could see spirits or not it proved they do have much more going on in their eyes than we initially thought’”

K responded with

“I agree but still thought the article was interesting.  Remember Joey my fluffy corgi?  I thought he saw ghosts but he also had ‘issues’.”

Note: Joey is not the dog who passed recently, Joey passed several years ago.

And after her comment, I decided to just leave the conversation at that.

Shortly after these comments happened, I got a text message from my mom, basically lecturing me about how terrible it was that I commented what I did:

So, my best friend. Let’s call her Mary. We’ve been friends for over a decade and we get along great. Like any friends, we have disagreements but we can tell each other anything. We’ve always been there for each other through painful breakups, bad grades on tests, big accomplishments, everything.

Mary recently got married and obviously I was thrilled for her. Now since high school at least, we’d always talk about getting married, being in each other’s bridal parties, etc. Obviously this is not a legally binding contract but things like that mean a lot to people, at least they did to me.

So several months before the wedding we’re hanging out and she breaks the news to me that they’ve decided to keep the bridal party family-only. Was I upset? Yeah, obviously, but hey, I can understand keeping things small. Then I find out that this family-only parry includes her fiancé’s brother’s girlfriend. Yeah, girlfriend. Not wife or even fiancée, girlfriend. I was blindsided and hurt, because to me, that’s NOT family. Mary and I might not share blood but in every other way we are sisters. I couldn’t believe she would do this to me. I know that being a bridesmaid might not be a big deal to everyone, but to me this felt like a complete betrayal of our friendship.

I told Mary I needed space and  she said she understood. We didn’t talk for a few months, the longest ever, but eventually I decided I didn’t want to lose our friendship over this. She knows more about me than probably anyone else in the world and I love her. So we made up and I went to the wedding. Honestly it was pretty painful for me to be there because I felt like an outsider rather than a best friend.

I’ll cancel plans last minute for no real reason, let the phone ring through to voicemail, leave texts on read, etc. We live quite far apart (as in several hours) so this can be a pretty big inconvenience as it’s no day trip. And yeah, like I said, I know this is all totally stupid, totally juvenile revenge. But it turns out I’m still hurt and angry and I don’t know what else to do. I tried talking to her about this before but I’ve always known she was someone who has “misters before sisters” priorities.

Well my mom said “you’re not going to psychology; you want to be around homeless people and crazy people all day?” (She’s very old-fashioned and back when she was growing up, psychology wasn’t nearly as established as it is now). He said no, it’s just interesting studying the human mind and he can see himself doing it for the rest of his life. My mom said he can major in that on his own dime but she’s not paying for such a useless degree (we get pretty good financial aid, but he’d still be looking at $12,000 a year if he went to an high tiered school). He looked at me for help (I normally back him up because our mom is unusually strict, but some reason, she sees me as the golden child and listens to my input more). I told him that if he wants to, he should probably just double major or minor in psych, but going to college solely for a psychology degree is a big waste of money and he'd have absolutely no job prospects if he graduates and doesn't go to grad school/decides he doesn't like psych, and he’ll see it when he’s older.

It was agreed upon that I now fully own the second floor as I have paid her and am fully paying for the renovations. My sister and my mom said they would move out of their rooms on the second floor. My mom would move downstairs and my sister would temporarily relocate until the renovations are done and then she will move back in to the 1st floor.

I gave notice to my landlord and knew I had to move out on the 25th of March. I told my mom and sister a month in advance about when I would move in. They were okay with that but made no move to get their things out of the second floor. March 25th comes around and I move out of my apartment and move my family's stuff in to the second floor. Lo and behold, my sister's and my mom's things were all still in all the cabinets and wardrobes. My sister had packed up some boxes and left them in her old room for the builders to move down. All her trash was in a pile in the middle of the living area. The cabinets she sold me are still full of her stuff which wants me to ""keep"" for her until she gets back after the renovations. My mom's clothes and most of her stuff are still in her room including lots of trash that she ""just hasn't had time to go through and see what she wants to keep"". All my things from my old apartment are still in boxes crammed in to the second floor along with all their things. It is unliveable. 

I'm 6 months pregnant and me, my husband and daughter have been hauling my sister's trash out for days now. She keeps calling me to say she wants to keep this and that and for me to ""pack it up for her"" I've also been lugging my mom's stuff down and she is not happy with me. She won't throw anything out as she needs to sort through so she knows what to keep and she doesn't want to rush. They both have been telling me not to move anything and to let the builders do it. Problem is, this is not the builder's jobs. Mom has been saying things like ""I don't want your sister to feel like she's being kicked out of her own room, so don't push her to move her things."" Both of them have been hinting that although I paid, I should put up with living with their things until it is convenient for them to move because we're family.

Never outside the country, just to other provinces and occasionally the United States. Well, my wife is pregnant with our first and she's due Feb 6th. Problem is, I'm scheduled for one of my business trips and im due to go to the other side of the country. I've tried everything in my power - i've literally done everything you could think of other than quitting. I've sat down with my people manager over this, we spent many many hours figuring out logistics and potential replacements, only to get overruled by those above me and my boss. I've filed complaints. I've rocked the boat as much as I can but I can't get out of this. And I'm not quitting for a variety of reasons, but chief amongst them is:

1) This is the best and highest-paying job I've ever had and I do not want to give it up.

2) We only just escaped a tough financial situation and while we do have around 4 months of savings built up, I really do not want to risk it. I am currently the only one providing income for our family (wife is on bed-rest due to a difficult pregnancy) and as much as I really want to be there for my lovely wife, I think I have to make this decision for the greater good.

I've known about this trip since about mid-December when it was being planned and I immediately told her about it and she brushed it off, she gave a little laugh and said that ""you'll be able to get the time off, won't you"" - I replied of course I will because, well, I was so sure at the time. So now that I told her that I really can't get the time off, she's been furious with me. We just had a long discussion about it and basically her points boiled down to, ""you're abandoning your duty as a husband and breaking the vows you made to me"". 

I can't believe she said that because what i'm doing is the exact opposite of what she says im doing, by working im providing for us and providing money that we are all going to live off of. I said that I want to be there, but I just literally can't. I've tried everything and I can't. ""And you saying that I'm abandoning my duty seems a little bit ungrateful to me, quite frankly.""

She mentioned she had a boyfriend who is a graduate student in another program I’m in (not sure if relevant but figured I’d mention this.)

I’m bad at reading vibes but I thought she might be flirting with me since she always sought me out on the bus and in class to sit together and chat.

She has a bunch of cousins that gave her tons of baby stuff and she has just asked for diapers and wipes from my family. Of course my sister and I want to get her all kinds of gifts, but we kid her about it. I wanted to give her a shower, but she wasn’t really interested in anything but a luncheon, so we said we’d do that and ask everyone to help put together her baby book in lieu of gifts. I keep mentioning that she’s likely to have the baby early because of her contractions, having a small torso and a very large baby, etc, but it’s mostly in fun.
So recently my husband and I have been talking about our grandparent names. I wanted to go with Emmy and he just wasn’t happy with super traditional ones, but didn’t know what he wanted otherwise. Stepdaughter is putting her foot down that she would NOT call me that and that she wants to call us Grandpa and my first name. When they were little their mom insisted I be called by my name even when stepdad was called dad. It hurt me to my core to think she wouldn’t allow me to have a grandparent name. Then she suggested MiMi and when I said I didn’t like it, she complained that I was steamrolling her on EVERYTHING about the baby including how to raise it?!? 
I feel like she’s being incredibly ungrateful, especially since she is now angry and calling off the luncheon we had planned for her.

My father had health problems for the last few years and he recently succumbed to them.. During this time my brother had gotten married and was on his honeymoon.

I made the choice to be the one to inform my brother of the news. Our mother died years ago, so I am the only one left in our family that's closest to him. I told any other distant family members to refrain from letting him know until I say it's okay.

I decided in all fairness, that he should get to enjoy his honeymoon with his new wife, and I decided not to tell him until he gets back.

We had a few gatherings and then the funeral happened. Some people were wondering why my brother wasn't there and I explained the situation that he is on his honeymoon. A few people thought it was the right thing to let him enjoy it, others thought I should have told my brother, so I guess that is where the divide began.

A few days after the funeral my brother came out and I quickly texted him that our father died. He almost immediately called me up and was freaking out, understandably. I expected he would be surprised, but he sounded flabbergasted as if our father had no health problems prior to his death. I told him that this was going to happen eventually.

He asked when the funeral would be and I explained to him that we already had it and then he started screaming at me on the phone and cursing at me. I hung up on him until he could calm down.

1,"AITA for making my wife go stand out to reserve a parking space I saw, causing her to get confronted by another driver? | We live near a large, popular shopping mall, that has a small parking lot and is always extremely busy. It is rare to find a parking space even near the entrance. 

We went to the mall tonight and as I was searching I saw an empty space in a close spot but I was one aisle over. I told my wife “go out and stand in the space and I’ll be right over”. She was hesitant but I told her to do it or else we would lose our opportunity because there were other cars driving down the aisles. She complied. From the time she got out until I got to the other aisle and to the parking space was less than 20 seconds. As I am approaching I see another car hovering near her and my wife is pointing at me as though to say “talk to him”. 

I roll down my window and this man is screaming that I can’t do that, that I can’t reserve a spot by putting a human in the space. I told him to immediately to move and we had an argument. The man also began screaming at my wife.  I began beeping and screaming for him to leave and move out of my way. Meanwhile my wife continues to stand there. She then started to say “let’s just go” but I told her to not move until the man left.

0,"WIBTA if I confronted my friend about how her ""boss babe"" lifestyle is ruining her friendships? | My friend, let’s call her Trisha, and I have been really close since we were both five years old. We're in our late twenties now. We have gone through many life stages together, and even lived with each other during college. We haven’t always seen eye to eye but generally have a great time and really love each other.

Since graduation, Trisha has traveled all over the world, first supporting herself by teaching English and then eventually starting an online business. I don’t want to give too many details away, but think “boss babe” type business, lots of emojis on social media, etc. It’s not an MLM but her posts have the feel of that. I have had to unfollow her posts because I do find their frequency excessive and their tone grating, but I have tried to be a supportive friend and applaud her on how committed she is and how hard she’s been working.

Trisha has come back to our home country after being abroad for a year, and she has been talking about visiting me soon. I have told her that I am really looking forward to seeing her, but I do need to know well in advance when to expect a houseguest. She has never given me a straight answer regarding when she plans to visit. This is annoying. I have a full-time job and other pursuits and like to plan in advance as much as possible.

I’ve been talking with some friends who live in the city that Trisha is currently in, and they’re all very frustrated with her. The friend who she is currently staying with has expressed anger and frustration that, despite her wishes, her home has appeared in Instagram videos of Trisha’s for her business. Another friend, Sally, is very upset that Trisha has been in town for a week and has not made any mention of it to her.

I feel like if Trisha wants to come visit me for a few days, I am expecting her to step away from her work and focus on catching up. I would be taking time off work and expecting her to do the same. I am also thinking of asking her to get a hotel or an Airbnb when she comes to see me, because I don’t want her filming in my apartment or sprawling out and making it into a home office. The idea of that stresses me out and makes me feel angry, I think because I resent her from being a really unresponsive friend all year (taking days to respond to messages then responding with one word, talking endlessly about “the biz” and how much money she’s making when we finally do get to talking, etc).

I was going to the hospital with my grandson for unimportant reasons and decided to have lunch there. This hospital is also where my son's ex-wife works. I decided to invite her to lunch with us. My wife would be upset and also knows my son would be very upset if I did this, so I told her to stay home for other reasons and didn't mention this to my son.

This is my explanation to my son after his negative reaction to todays events:

"" Throwawayson - it is perfectly within your right to withhold your time and Throwawaygrondson from me and unfortunately your Mom who clearly has your back on this issue. That said you’ve said from the get go that you were not going to speak Ill of throwawaygrandson's Mom in front of him. How are you going to explain your punishment of Grandpa to your very smart son. I am truly sorry you feel so strongly on something I did that had no impact on your time with your son. We were going to eat at the hospital cafeteria because I had free food coupons and were there to pick up his things. On a previous visit when the three of us were going to eat at the cafeteria throwawaygrandson had asked Grammie and me if we were inviting his Mom to eat with us. Your Mom said we would not and said something neutral that didn’t bash his Mom. While you have been very clear on your desires in regards to your ex wife I have also been clear I feel it prudent for us to maintain at least a casual relationship with the mother of my grandson. I feel the same with throwaways-other-ex-daughter even though what she did to throwaways-other-son and their family disgusts me as much as what throwaways-ex-daughter did to you and her family. I did not wish her Merry any holiday nor happy birthday nor do we share any chit chat communications. While you and I cannot see this from each other’s perspective we can agree to disagree without exposing  throwawaysgrandson to the depth of the issues between his parents. Regardless of how badly you decide to punish me please do not put any of this on throwawaysgrandson. Today was just a normal fun day with Grandpa that happened to include his Mom. I was the one who text her offering her to join our lunch. I didn’t tell or ask him not to say anything to you of Grammie as that would imply what happened as wrong.

I am currently rather confused about my own feelings and I would like to have some outside perspective on whether I am TA because of what I am planning to do next.

My best friend, Kay, started dating my ex Liam behind my back. Liam and I dated for about nine months two and a half years ago and it wasn't a good relationship. He did not treat me particularly well and Kay knew about this. As my confidante and best friend, she actually knew how bad I felt in that relationship until I broke it off. I want to make it clear that today my ex is not my problem, but her actions are.

A few months ago, Kay started seeing Liam behind my back. When I realised this was happening started limiting contact with her. She noticed and started contacting a few of my friends to talk about the whole situation and - according to my friends - get validation for what her actions which apparently she even got from one of my girlfriends.  When she finally contacted me I told her that I withdrew from her as a friend because I am hurt about her actions. Now Reddit, I am fully aware that I don't own neither my ex nor will I ever tell Kay who she's got to date, it certainly isn't up to me. But I am hurt over the fact that she started dating him without ever considering how it would make me feel, throwing the last bit of loyalty and integrity towards me out of the window and that's what I told her. She apologised for not being transparent and after this she just started to pretend everything was fine between us. I kept telling her that to me it's not and that I have lost trust in her.

In my opinion she can't simply expect to date him and still maintain a friendship with me, even if that is what she so badly wants. I feel she chose him over me and I have lost my confidante over this. I don't want to stand in her way, I have always wanted nothing but happiness for her. But I definitely don't want to be a part of this. I am almost three months pregnant and I have to put my baby's and my well-being first right now and I feel like I desperately need to get away from the situation because it stresses me out so much. I think the best way to do it for me is to cut contact and cancel the friendship so I won't have to think about it ever again. I guess by doing that, I will get a lot of shit from our common social circle which stresses me out even more because of my upcoming wedding.

I don't expect her to stop dating my ex but I feel as she expects me to just pretend the whole situation didn't hurt my feelings and wants to reconcile the friendship.

I've been hanging out with this group of friends for about 11 years. Some I met during college and others got into it as the years went by. Last year we lost one of our friends, Michael, because of a cardiac arrest. Michael was married, had been for 4 years and knew his wife for even longer than that. In our same group there is Adam, who was friends with Michael since high school and got into our group at the same time Michael did. 

Now the issue that is the reason behind this post is that Adam has told us a couple days ago that he's dating Michael's widow. We were all surprised by this because we never saw it coming. After Michael died we all did our best to provide comfort and support for her, Adam included, but as far as we knew and as far as he told us at the time they were just hanging out/having talks when she needed. Now we get to find out they have been getting to know each other better for at least 6 months. When Michael has been dead for 1 year and 4 months. 

This has split the group in three. The ones that believe that they should be allowed to do whatever they want and don't see a problem with it. Then the ones that believe he's taking advantage of Michael's widow. And the ones that think they're both wrong and also don't want to be around Adam and her anymore.

I'm with the last group. Yes, everyone deals with grief in different ways but this doesn't sit right with me and I also think it's just a tasteless thing to do.

Apparently she was one of very few who made it to the interview stage, and the company's interviews are notoriously harsh. Unfortunately she doesn't think she has anything she could wear to the interview. She does have some ''formal'' clothing but according to her its more the stuff you wear at a wedding rather than something professional for a job interview. 

In spite of the age difference Rachel and Chloe are quite close in both height and build. Although Rachel's suits are tailored to her, I thought they would still look nice on Chloe. 

I took some stuff out of Rachel's room and suggested Chloe try them on. She ended up really liking one of Rachel's dark suits. She looked amazing in it and I imagine she'll look very professional in the interview room. I let her take the suit and give it back after her interview. 

Rachel was out with her friends today, and when she got home I told her about the day. When I told her Chloe took one of her suits she went mad, saying how dare I touch her things, calling me a ''fucking idiot'' and storming off and slamming the door like a teenager. 

I had a chat with my husband, and with some thought I agree that I should have asked Rachel before I gave Chloe her stuff, but even so I did it to help out a family member which is hardly a bad thing.

So I was on this survey site. I needed thirty dollars on the survey site to finally check out. I was on 29 dollars. Each referral gives you a dollar.

For the weeks before then I had half heartedly been asking my cousin if she could join and she could give me a referral. She was always too lazy because the signing up process is kinda hectic and I just dropped it because it was one dollar,

She told me however that she would join but that she didn’t see the need, that she could just cashapp me a dollar. I told her it’s not the same. I just didn’t push on it for a while.

For added context she’s been on these sites before so she knows about the sign up process.

So today, me on 29 dollars, not interested in any additional surveys, had the bright idea of using any second email and her phone number to register. I realized that I could just do it for her and I didn’t want to bother her to check her email. Then after the process came time for phone validation. I put her phone number there and went to her room to ask if she had gotten a code. 

She was working at the moment, and it involved her transcribing voice notes from the hospital she works at into a word document. I asked her if she could check her messages real quick and she told me she was busy. I told her it would only take a second and then she snapped really aggressively at me, so I backed off.

About an hour later, I see her coming over to me, thinking she was going to give me the code, instead she asks
“How did these people get my number?”

I was pissed because I know that she knows these sites require number verification. She also knows that her number wouldn’t be leaked to thirsty guys online or anything. I felt she was trying to shift the narrative and instead of apologizing for being aggressive over something so trivial, she wanted to flip it around on me and make me seem like the bad guy.

I told her she should no longer worry about t and I didn’t need her number anymore. She got angry and she hasn’t been speaking to me since. AITA?",False,False,3,2,4,1,1,2,Loyalty
0,"AITA for telling my best friend that his girlfriend is the worst? | This is my first post ever/I’m on mobile, sorry about any formatting. 

I have a best friend named Ian. He was my roommate in college (we have graduated by now though), has been there for me through a lot of things, and is just generally a good guy. Since we both graduated college, I don’t get to see him as often anymore. 

He has been dating a girl for about 8 months now, let’s call her Morgan. At first I was really happy for him because they seem so happy on social media and every time I talk to him, he has so many good things to say about her. It was a little annoying that he would bring her up in our conversations so often, but I was genuinely happy for him so I let it go. 

By now, I have met Morgan maybe 4 times. Each time we hang out, I am in pure disbelief that she treats my buddy with such blatant disrespect. She will tell him that his shirt is ugly and he should change, comments on what he orders and says he should watch his weight, curses loudly in public, interrupts him when he is speaking to me, and she is just generally unpleasant. 

I wanted to like her so badly. After every bad experience with her, I told myself that she can’t possibly keep her attitude up, or that mr friend will soon realize that he deserves so much better than her. But they just get more and more serious as time goes on, and the other day he told me he was thinking about proposing when they go on vacation in a couple of months.

I know that it’s not my place, but I couldn’t hold it in any longer, and I finally told him what I thought of Morgan. I told him that she is rude, crass, and that it hurts to see how she treats him. I told him that I wanted him to be happy, but I don’t know if she would make him happy long term. 

I should have seen this coming, but he flipped out at me. He said things to me that I never would have expected from him, and I told him I feel like Morgan’s bad attitude is rubbing off on him. I eventually apologized and he accepted my apology, but things are still strained between us. Not to mention, Morgan has now deleted me as a friend on every social media platform, so he obviously told her what I said, thus ensuring that Morgan and I will never be able to be friends.

I feel really badly about the whole situation, but the way she treated him was borderline verbal abuse, and I couldn’t take it any longer. Things been Ian and I are tense, and I’m worried that my friendship with him is over forever, which would really really suck.

0,"AITA for Working so Much OT to get two Paintings? | Obvious throwaway. But anyway!

So I've really enjoyed the works of a certain artist and have a lot of his prints. I nearly screamed one day when I saw on eBay someone selling two of his originals in gorgeous frames that happened to be some of my favorites. Now, his originals typically sell for around $2,000 a piece. I couldn't pull the trigger on what the seller originally wanted so I watched the auctions, hoping no one would buy them.

As time passed the amounts went lower and lower until the cost for both would be less than $2,000 combined. The seller seemed to be getting fed up having no luck and decided this last time to say if they didn't sell they were going into storage. I HAD to get them so I messaged the seller and we worked out a payment plan/deal.

I'm justifying buying them/paying for these by working a ton of OT. My workplace is shorthanded, and kind of a hellhole, so there's an abundance of opportunities and I've been working some double shifts. Obviously this had made me pretty tired. I've wanted to sleep every chance I can and I'll admit I haven't seen/talked with my boyfriend too much. I told him what was going on, that this could be a once in a lifetime chance to own these originals, and he seemed OK with it at first.

He gradually got angrier and angrier about how long it took me to respond to messages and I'll admit I've been having trouble following conversations because I'm so tired. The OT was going to be the majority of this month and ended yesterday so we could have Halloween together.

Now he doesn't want to hang out. He's saying things like ""Won't you be too tired?"" and ""Don't want you falling asleep on me again!"" in really mean/sarcastic tones. He also seems to think I valued those paintings over him when this is the one time I've ever made something like this my priority (we've know each other for 5 years and dated for a bit over two of those). 

Was I the asshole for kind of neglecting our relationship for being able to afford the paintings? I really thought doing this one oddball thing once and never again would be OK.",False,False,3,2,4,1,1,3,Loyalty
1,"AITA for picking up a girl that my friend refused to go for? | Very classic setting. We're in the library studying for our exam and we see two very cute looking girls at the copier, giggling away and making us smile in the distance. He told me ""You see those two at the copier?"" I literally answered ""Say no more fam. I had the same thought."" And he had his eye on the girl with a yellow headband. 

That was the same I wanted to talk to and I told him ""Yeah I would've gone for her too, but you shoot your shot man I'll leave her up to you."" I have a little more confidence and experience just talking to strangers in general while he doesn't. I told him he should just go for it, walk up to her as it is the hardest part, and then just stand your ground and say whatever come to mind first.

He kept hyping himself up and I helped hype him up too, but he wouldn't move no matter what. I hated that in that moment, he was all talk and no walk. I got kind of irritated by him not going for what he wants to go for simply because he has sweaty palms. Told him it'd be worse if he let this go than if he got rejected. Well, he didn't learn and so I said ""If you don't go for her, I will."" 

Well, half a minute like this goes by and the girls were done copying there stuff and were about to leave, I went up to her and got her number. Came back to my friend and he was just pissed. For some reason he went off about how I was on a power trip, and ""I get you can do this better than me"" and ""is this funny to you? Pretty asshole thing to do man""

&#x200B;

I'm baffled. He didn't go for it no matter what, I encouraged him and he didn't move. Was it really an asshole thing of me to do? Personally I don't think so.",False,False,2,3,4,1,1,3,Loyalty
1,"AITA for telling the woman seated next to me that there was no need for her to bring two basketballs to an NBA game? | My uncle took me (21M) and a few of my  cousins to an NBA game last night: Lakers vs. Warriors at the Warriors home court. He’s rich and paid for our tickets. I’ve been a Lakers fan all my life even though I grew up in the Bay Area. The only Lakers jersey I have is that of Kobe Bryant so I wore that to the game. There was this woman seated next to me, most likely in her late twenties, who was drinking a lot and being really rowdy all game. I wasn’t half as loud as she was. She was with her man. 


She never directly bothered me though until the third quarter when the Lakers started to blow the Warriors out. She told me that I didn’t need to wear my bandwagon jersey to the game because it made me look like a fool. I’m pretty quick with comebacks. She was wearing a very low cut top with half her giant fake tits hanging out. I looked at her chest for a bit, looked up, and told her that there was no need for her to bring two basketballs to an NBA game. She screamed “what the fuck did you say?” Her man told her to drop it and not bother me. 


She kept trying to say something to me, so her man got her to switch seats with him. He apologized for her being drunk. He told me how much he liked Kobe and how sad he is that he’s no longer here. He seemed like a great dude. I wasn’t bothered after that. My uncle, cousins, and I discussed the incident after the game. My female cousin and one of my male cousins think my comment was out of line for the situation while my uncle and my other male cousin thought it was fine.",False,False,2,3,4,2,1,3,Loyalty
