1,"AITA for taking some random girl's clothes out of the dryer? | Made some girl really mad. 

My college dorm has 6 washers and only 4 dryers. Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. 

Came back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying ""HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.""

Sure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?",False,False,2,4,1,3,1,3,Fairness
0,"WIBTA for refusing to split a bill 50/50 between my sister & her husband? | When the three of us go out to dinner once or twice a month, we end up splitting the bill evenly between our 2 credit cards: mine, and the one to her & her husband's joint account. So I end up paying for half of my brother in law's meal, essentially. I let it slide a couple of times, now I realize I've gone & set a precedence: they now expect me to pick up half the tab when we're out together.

Historically, money has always been a very touchy subject in our family. But frankly I'm not comfortable spending my own fun-money on my brother in law's food, charming man though he is. I'm going to bring it up with my sister this week. But first I wanted to make sure there wasn't some kind of tacit code of conduct when it came to married couples.

I've not had him very long and he has already gone through 4 pairs not to include the pairs my Boyfriend had. After about the second pair I realised I would have to keep them out of reach.

My brother never did anything with therapy and he’s aware he can manipulate my mom by saying certain things so he doesn’t have to do anything to lift a finger. It took multiple teachers to point out to my parents that I wasn’t able to read and that I had what seemed like dyslexia in the 4th grade.

0,"WIBTA if I put my dad on blast on social media because he is trying to profit from my little brother's death? | ***Edit to follow rules, sorry for duplicate. 

My brother died about two weeks ago.

My parents are divorced and most of my siblings don't really talk to my dad because of some shitty things he did to my mom and also because he was generally a bad parent. I was a senior in high school when they divorced so I didn't really get caught up in the custody battle, but my little brother chose to live with my mom full time as soon as he could (14 here). 

Fast forward to now, my brother was in his early 20's and tragically died two weeks ago. We held his memorial this week and due to current world conditions had to severely limit the size of the gathering. Additionally, because he explicitly requested it, we had him cremated. My mom and I covered the costs, and the memorial went as well as it could given world and family circumstances, in addition to the tragic nature of his death. 

I found out the day before the memorial that my dad started a GoFundMe to cover the costs of the memorial, and today found out that he also started a donation checking account and is asking his side of the family, his church, his coworkers, and my brother's coworkers to donate in order to help cover the costs of the memorial (which again, my mom and I already paid for and he said he could not afford to help with). 

This is a tragic time and I really don't want to start shit or cause contention, but honestly this makes me completely sick to my stomach because he has already raised several thousand dollars (about 3x the actual costs) and I think he is trying to profit off my brother's death. Additionally, the people who are generously donating are doing so under the assumption that their money goes toward helping with funeral costs, not directly into my dad's pockets. 

Trying to see my dad's side, I know he is in bad shape financially as he does not make much money in general, has debt, and is laid off for the time being. I'm sure he could use the money. He is also grieving, and expressed a lot of regret about our childhoods at the memorial. He may be planning to spend the money on some sort of memorial object, but we already bought him a nice urn amd gave him a portion of the ashes and there is no grave for a grave stone, so I am not sure what that would be. 

I still think he is acting completely unethically and potentially defrauding people. Would I be the asshole if I posted on social media asking him what he is raising money for and letting people know that the costs have already been covered and there is no need for donations? Instead, if people feel compelled to donate, they should donate to a charity or something. 

So, reddit, wibta? 

TL;DR my brother died a few weeks ago. My mom has already covered the funeral costs but my dad has started a GoFundMe to cover funeral costs and is pocketing the money. WIBTA if I called him out on social media?",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness
0,"Aita for letting a stranger’s kid run into me? | I was walking down the sidewalk today when a group of kids came running towards me. Where I live it’s a widely agreed upon convention that pedestrians keep right except to pass in the way that cars do. These kids were in my lane and they were old enough to know better. In the distance I heard a parent put out a half assed “watch where you’re going, Kaden.” 

Kaden didn’t watch where he was going. 

As anticipated it soon became clear he expected me to get out of his way for him. I saw this as a teaching opportunity and decided to not alter my walking path or cadence. Shortly after he ran face first into me. Now I’m not entirely heartless so I made sure he didn’t connect with my knee, but he did land square on his butt. Once on the ground he thought for a moment, rolled over, hopped up, and ran away. The absence of an apology was noted. 

I feel what I did was reasonable. I firmly believe that if I had moved out of his way I’d’ve reinforced his bad behavior. By assisting him to the ground I helped him learn an important lesson about keeping right and the consequences of being careless. Mombie clearly wasn’t impressed but didn’t say anything.

We exchange pleasantries and go on our way with our respective friends.

Background: I went on one date with Harry once like 4 - 5 years ago (maybe more). I never wanted another date after that. 

Yet lately, as in the past few months, every time he sees me at this party, he tries to have a conversation and inevitable leads it into something about ""we should get a coffee sometime."" I am in no way interested in him and I have a serious boyfriend now.

This past weekend, it happened again and he clarified that he wanted to get coffee AS FRIENDS. And I was basically like... ""But we aren't friends.""

He looked so confused. 
Him: ""But... we went on a date once.""
Me: ""Yea... like 5 years ago. That doesn't make us friends.""
Him: *blank stare*
Me: ""You don't even know me, dude.""
Him: *blank stare*
Me: ""Okay, if you still have my number, then text me and I'll think about it.""

My friend and I walk away. Then we pass by him again a little while later on our way out to leave.
He comes up to me with his phone and says, ""Is this your number?""

He still had me in his phone all these years later (ridiculous) with the correct number,  but incorrect last name (slightly misspelled). I took his phone, corrected my name and said, ""If we were actually friends, you would know what my last name was.""

Anyway, I think he got the hint because he never contacted me. Or maybe I still have his number blocked. Lol.

Before this, I was still out of school (I graduated early) but with no job. During this time my role in the family was to help my mother watch the infant (only an hour or so a day), clean up around the house, and most importantly, make dinner every night. It was something I was passionate about and enjoyed doing, and it would take quite a while to create big, elaborate dinners for my family of 6. They complimented me on the food many times and obviously enjoyed it.

However, they did complain that the food was usually 'late' (they wanted it ready at around 5:30 or 6 but i usually finished it at 6:30 or 7). And during this time they would also accuse me of doing nothing all day.

Additionally, Im cool with some times just eating a sandwich or some cereal or some instant ramen for dinner, yknow, simple easy & quick stuff but they demanded full sit-down meals every night.

0,"AITA for not making my boyfriend a coffee when he asks? | I need some outside perspective on this

My partner of 3 years has taken to asking me to do things for him ""as a nice gesture"" and getting really put out when I don't.

For example; last weekend partner was playing with my son building a construction toy. I had finished making everyone lunch, put it in the oven, and had just sat down to spend time with my other child.

Partner called me into the room and said ""could you make me a coffee and *son a tea"" and I replied (fairly lighthearted) ""you guys know where the kettle is"". (I'm not a coffee drinker if that's relevant, so I wouldn't be making one for myself) 

He's also keeps asking me iron his work shirts as ""it would be a nice thing for me to do"" (some context: we don't live together and I hardly ever iron anything as I wear medical scrubs for work)

He's now upset as he thinks that these sort of things are nice gestures and the foundation of a loving relationship, and I'm basically being mean by refusing to do them.

Previously, I have made him coffee when he's asked if he's been busy and it's been the two of us, but I think what made me prickly is that he called me into the room and asked in front of my son. I have a visceral ""nope"" reaction as I feel it's really gendered, and I don't want to fall into the dynamic where the woman waits on the ""men of the house"".

However, I'm not sure if my vision is clouded on this due to bad past experiences.

Then today we were cleaning the house ready for someone coming round a bit later and his parents rang to say they are on there way and will be 5 minutes.

0,"AITA for telling my mom to get a lawyer for her will so my brother doesn’t screw me over for my inheritance? | My parents are not rich by any means but they made very smart investments in properties in India. They have about a million dollars invested in India and they’re currently in the process of selling everything over there and bringing it over to the U.S. now. They’re looking for real estate to invest in the U.S. 

Because of this, my brother (22M) and I (16F) have a decent inheritance. My mom made it clear that she wouldn’t just give us straight up money, but rather pay for undergrad and grad school if we needed it, our weddings, and also the down payment of our first house. All properties that they still have would be divided equally between my brother and me. 

Now my brother has taken upon himself to find these properties. He just searches real estate websites for properties and shows them to my mom. He found one recently that my parents liked and they were looking into investing. Now here’s the issue:

He argued that the property should go to him eventually because he was the one who found it. But he literally just searched on a real estate website for a couple hours and found it. I understand wanting a commission or something, but him getting the whole property just seems ridiculous to me. 

This was shocking to both my mom and me because she’s made it abundantly clear that everything will be split 50-50 so him suddenly demanding the whole thing for a few hours work is appalling. 

It should also be made clear that my brother has no idea what he wants to do. He’s switched career paths like probably 4 times in the last year, and the only thing he really cares about is traveling. So I think he’s just trying to land this property so he can travel and not have to worry about actually having a job since the income from the property would fund his traveling. 

He got really mad that she said this (admittedly, the way she reacted was not kindly) and refused to forward the details of the property. 

So I got really upset that he’s trying to take what we agreed was ours, so I told my mom that she should get a lawyer to figure out her will and have it taken care of legally. At this point, she hadn’t because she thought it was clear that we knew what she wanted for us and that we would respect it. She agreed and said she would look into it after all this craziness dies down.

My brother flipped out and said that we were making a big deal out of nothing and that there is no reason to spend all that money on legal fees. My dad agreed especially since traditionally in India, property goes to the firstborn son and I would get all the gold and jewelry. 

As in typical Indian affairs, all of our family and family friends got involved and think my mom and I are being ridiculous because getting lawyers for wills is unheard of and maybe even “disrespectful to my elder brother”. 

That made me rethink whether I made the right choice, especially since my parents are still young and so are my brother and I. Maybe this won’t be an issue when we fully grow up.

He tells us he does not have a bunch of friends which motivates my friend and I to help him make friends. At this point, Troy seems like a cool dude so far. 

We start inviting him to parties and other social events to help him make new friends. Almost every time he gets to the parties we invite him to, he goes off by himself to socialize with other people, which is good. But I noticed that when we meet up with him after Troy's wandered off, he acts differently. He acts as if he we were friends for a long time and becomes rude to us in front of his new associates. For example, when we tell him that we are planning to leave the party, he tells us to stop trying to rush him or says something like ""does it look like I want to leave with you guys right now?"" in front of his new ""friends"". Like bro, we are just telling you we are leaving. He would talk down on us as if he has superior intellect compared to us, always sounding condescending.

Troy comes back from Europe and he starts saying stuff to us in Dutch (he's not European) and talks with a Dutch accent. Fast forward 1.5 years later, we all have summer classes together. We invite Troy to a kick back with a couple of my other friends. He still brags about Europe and talks with a German accent. My friends and I find it very annoying that this guy clings onto this one thing and talks as if he himself is German. For example, we would talk about some subject and Troy would be like ""Well in the Netherlands..."".

She told me that she started the process of being sober 6 years ago, but that she hasn’t been sober the entire time. She admitted for awhile she thought maybe she wasn’t really an alcoholic and started drinking again. Then she started going to AA again.

My friend, Katie (29) and her boyfriend Tim (31), are invited to a wedding. The bride and groom are friends of Tim - they live in the same apartment complex so they've established a fairly strong friendship from what I'm told. Tim is not standing up at the wedding, so no incredibly important role, I think that may be important for the context. 

So the bride and groom are having a destination wedding in Cancun. Katie has been hesitant to go for a few reasons, the obvious one being finances. Flight and hotel would be at least a thousand... and she'd have to take at least three days off of work because the wedding is on 4/20 (a Monday!). Also, Katie is not close with the bride and groom. Her boyfriend, Tim, wants her to go to ""make a vacation out of it."" 

Here's the kicker though, the bride and groom want guests to sit through a timeshare in order to come! Like, it's part of the package or something... I told Katie that when you sit through a timeshare you are supposed to get something out of it (free trip, hotel room, etc...). 
She has never sat through a timeshare before so I think this was news to her. We both already think it's tacky. Once she told me that she still has to pay for everything for her trip though I said that I think the bride and groom are kind of scamming their guests. Maybe the bride and groom are reaping some sort of benefits from guests attending a timeshare while said guests recieve no benefits of doing so?

It's been a long time since I sat through one so I'm not sure. In any case, I told her I'd put my foot down and not go because that's absurd to ask of your guests. She then asked me to post to this thread asking if she'd be the TA for not attending and/or telling her boyfriend that if he really wants her there then he can pay for it.

0,"AITA for asking my mum to pay me back for a parking ticket on my car? | So I let my mum borrow my car to drive to the hospital for a hearing appointment. She apparently parked in the staff parking area so she wouldn't have to pay, and when she got back to the car, there was a parking ticket on it. £120, reduced to £60 if paid within 14 days.


She waited until late that night, after she'd dropped the car back with me, to say 'oh yeah, there's a parking fine on it you need to pay'.


Once I found out the reason for the fine, I explained that I would pay it, but she needs to pay me back, as it was a fine under her watch.


This apparently makes me a terrible person and daughter. Bear in mind, we both work fairly well paid jobs and she's in her 50's, so isn't retired or on her pension.

1,"AITA for joking about my older sister still reading children's books? | Hii, I've made an alt account especially to post this because my older sister uses Reddit and knows my regular account. I'm 19f and she is 27f.

&#x200B;

We've both been readers for basically our entire lives and used to share books and pretty much always read the same books. She'd also read to me when I was young. Overall we had a pretty great relationship and had the same interests and favourite genres; mostly fantasy.

&#x200B;

My sister has always preferred reading young adult books, which are books with a target audience for kids aged 12-17. In my opinion, they are children's books, but my sister doesn't think so. For most of her life now she's pretty much exclusively read young adult, whereas I moved onto adult books at age like 16 lol. For those who don't know what young adult is, these are some examples; Twilight, Hunger Games, Throne of Glass, The Mortal Instruments, The Vampire Diaries, Six of Crows, Red Queen, etc. There are plenty of people who enjoy young adult, but I still think you should move onto adult books when you reach a certain age.. but that's just me. My sister will often say there are women in their forties in her book club reading young adult and I find that strange.

&#x200B;

So we all went out for dinner last night and as we were talking about what new books we'd both read, I told her she should try and move onto adult books and recommended a few to her she'd enjoy. She explained she just gets bored easily with adult books and wants to stick to young adult, and I called her a child in a JOKEY way and said she should grow up and move onto real stories. I'm not saying young adult isn't real but like, they're definitely not as in depth as Wheel of Time for example. She got mad, but didn't really dwell on it, parents said I was being really rude and I should just let her enjoy what she wants to. We had a tiny argument where I tried explaining where I'm coming from, but sister told me to shut up and refused to listen to what I had to say, even though I was gonna make good points. 

&#x200B;

My sister isn't that angry with me, she kinda just laughed it off but my parents called me an elitist and said they didn't bring me up that way, and my dad (he is who we get our love of reading from) says everyone can read whatever they want to and I should stay out of it.

0,"AITA for asking my sister to not talk during the film? | A week ago my family watched Knives Out. During the film my sister continually talked over characters as they spoke and also asked ""why is that funny?"" after jokes. I ignored it until halfway through when she started to ask a question over a character's pivotal dialogue, telling her we can talk about it afterwards. She got visibly upset and continued to comment on the film and ask why we found it funny. After the film I explained to her why I found it rude, but she told me it's her way of experiencing films and that it's valid, and that she had no trouble understanding the dialogue that was being spoken while she spoke. I conceded that talking during a movie is a valid way to experience films but that it changes the way I would like to experience them, which is to be mostly quiet until after the movie when we can discuss.

Fast forward to yesterday, we were planning to watch 1917. She said she didn't want to initially and asked that we start it earlier than normal at 7 so she wouldn't be kept up by the film, which we all agreed to and planned our days around. Before we began she decided she did want to watch the movie, so I asked her if she could please not talk during this film. She again grew visibly tense and ignored me until I asked again when she said I was imposing a rule on her. I replied that earlier when she asked us to watch the movie at 7 I was fine with that and considered it a courtesy, not a rule, and that this was similar. She said the two weren't equivalent at all and that I was invalidating her way of watching movies. I replied citing the don't talk or text PSA in theaters, and that it's not unfair to expect people to be mostly quiet. But she said this was controlling and invalidating and kept her from viewing the film her way. I then explained how I greatly value the experience of taking in a film and that I am taken out of it by talking, but she said she likes to verbally process. My sibling agreed that they are also taken out of films by talking. She felt ganged up on and declared that she doesn't even like movies and doesn't understand why it has to be so serious, and left the room.   


So am I the asshole for wanting her to be quiet during the film if we're watching together? I agree that her way of experiencing films is valid, I make small comments too sometimes if I'm watching a movie that's less serious at home, but it seems selfish to change the experience of a dramatic film for others by talking and voicing your opinions while the film is still in progress. She argued that it's just as rude for me to change her experience of the film by telling her to be quiet, but it doesn't seem equivalent to me. Is it? Am I overstepping my bounds to try to change someone's experience of a film in this way?

Some of the guys that work for me I know are willing to work holidays for the double time. So I tell him one of my guys will probably be willing to work and get it fixed. I give him the guys the number, put my phone on silent, and go back to my family.

My guys know what the rates are and what to charge service calls. They also know to tell people when they call what it cost just for them to go out there.

Obviously service calls on holidays cost more just for the double time, but a lot of people don’t know that legally we have to pay our employees for at least 4 hours whether they’re there for 15minutes or the full 4 hours. So 4 hours of double time plus cost of materials adds up to a bill of a few hundred dollars.

My husband and I have two children together. He also has a daughter from a previous relationship that is 15 (less than a month younger than my daughter) let’s call her Jane. 

When my ex-husband and I divorced, he was in law school. He is now a lawyer and does very well for himself. 

Alice was not doing well in school during her freshman year. She and her father struck up a deal that if she made all As he would give her an increase in her allowance. 

She made all As in the first semester. Her father increased her allowance from $65 a week to *$250* a week. He and I had an argument about this. I think it is entirely too much money. I can’t afford to give Jane the same treatment. I caved and told her that she was required to save some of it each week. 

Alice has had the allowance for about two months, and she is starting to buy very expensive items. It is making Jane resentful. The latest thing she wanted to buy was an Apple Watch. Jane has been asking for one for several months, I told her that I couldn’t afford it but would get her a Fitbit.

My mom, being the kind and understanding woman she is, put up with it. But I could see the stress was getting to her. She'd have to take medication constantly just to keep calm. Finally, my aunt paid her rent, an entire month behind.

Soon after, my mom decided it was best to kick her out. She gave her a week to pack her things and move out. My aunt called her several times, trying to ""reason"" with her about how she and her boyfriend didn't have anywhere to go. Then, her boyfriend called and argued with my mom about the whole thing, nearing the point of threatening her. Mom didn't listen and kicked them out yesterday. After they left, mom and a friend of hers went up to check the damages.

I asked if it was okay to tell my grandma about the whole situation because I felt she deserved to know. The reason I asked is because my aunt had told us not to tell my grandma or my uncle (her brother) about her new boyfriend or her bad living situation.

My mom gave me the go-ahead and said it was okay. So, as gently and casually as I could, I told her everything. The late rent, the disgusting state she left our apartment in, her boyfriend, everything. My grandma seemed kind of shell-shocked and didn't say much after that. My uncle said he wasn't surprised by her behavior.

I said goodbye to them and left, got home and went to bed. The next day, my mom called me into her room and said she had something to tell me. Turns out, my grandma had called my aunt and ripped her a new one. My aunt was furious. She called my mom and said that I ruined her relationship and that her boyfriend left her immediately after finding out her mom knew about them. She says I had no right to tell her, that if she wanted grandma to know, she would have told her herself.

We’re looking at a place that’s around 800 a month. It’s a low-income and the reason I’ve been very keen on the place we’re supposed to be moving into is because it is two blocks away from my school and a 5-10 minute car ride to her work vs the 30 minute commute we both make right now.

However, my weeknight dinners are almost always these takeaway leftovers since I eat pretty small portions and takeaway in my city is quite large.

Tonight is Sunday and I don't have school tomorrow. My mom has plans and my dad will be home the rest of the evening. So I asked him if he wanted to order in pizza/burgers to have a dinner together and he told me no, there are leftovers.

I knew for a fact (and still know, because I am literally looking into my fridge at this moment) that the only leftover things I could make a meal from were takeaway potatoes and a kebab. This was my food that I was permitted to order in WITH MY OWN MONEY because they weren't home to drive to a grocery store and I had nothing to cook with.

I said to my dad verbatim ""Okay, I'll just have my meat and potatoes then"" to which he closed my door and said okay. 

I come out half an hour later to eat and I realize not only are my potatoes all gone, but the entire kebab is also gone. Meaning, apart from a lime, half a tin of baking soda, string cheese, and a frozen thing of chocolate covered bananas, I have no food options.

I go into the living room, ask my dad why he ate my leftovers, and he said ""Because you didn't tell me you were going to eat them."" I tell him that that's what ""Okay, I'll just have my meat and potatoes then"" means, and he tells me ""you're too late.""

I ask him to drive me to the grocery store, he says no. I ask him if I can walk, he says no.

So I pick up the phone, dial in takeaway that I want, and within :30 minutes I'm eating food at the table. This was not with my money, though, this was with his card. That's why I might be TA in this situation, but if he ate my leftovers that I claimed that I paid for with my own money, I should be able to reimburse (I only spent 15$ on his card while the leftovers were around the same if that matters) myself, no?

He works at a hospital so it's important that he's not late in case of an emergency. 

My sister also complains about everything. Our basement flooded and she was upset at my family for putting up new walls, flooring and furniture because our old ones were destroyed and rotted.

Often, when I leave this particular Chick-Fil-A I’ll go ask for a refill on my soda; there’s a little spot off to the side of the registers where all the soda seekers seem to stand in order to be noticed and helped.  

So mom and kids finish their meal, leave the table with ALL their trash still on/around it, and go stand in the soda spot.  So I’m thinking, dafuq? They’re just gonna leave this shit for someone else to clean up? They’re seriously over there waiting for their to-go refills and are gonna peace out without cleaning up.  What a twat waffle....

I make eye contact with mom and give her my most disapproving stare down.  I was literally attempting to burn a hole in her face.  I held my gaze for an ungodly amount of time as if to say “I see you, and I know what you did.  I hope your crotch monsters sneeze in your eye balls and draw on your walls with your most expensive lipstick”

So then, they are each handed an ice cream and return to their table.  

Oh god, oh god..... I’m avoiding any further eye contact as I gather my shit to leave at the speed of light.  

I’m sorry I assumed the worst, but it did look bad.

Basically my fiance keeps telling all of her friends, family, and coworkers basically everything going on in my life.

It really bothers me when people seem to know very personal details about my life and I'm not the one who told them, but my fiance doesn't see it as a big deal because she's a very open person. I've tried multiple times to talk with her calmly about it but she continues to do it, which resulted in me blowing up a bit at her today when her mom asked about my cardiologist appointment and I asked how she knew about that.

0,"WIBTA if I were to quit my job without two weeks notice? | I very recently got my job back at Target. I originally quit this past September and I did the courtesy of putting my notice. But I was fired from my last job and now I've come back to Target since I got desperate for some employment. But in my return, I've found out that a lot of former friends who worked there have now quit, most of them without putting in notice. That was disappointing, but I soon understood why: The new boss. 

My first day back to Target was this past Thursday and that's when I meet the new store director, who we'll just call ""Beth"". She's the leader of the whole store and she started working this job just a couple of months before I came back. She's absolutely horrible. When I came back, I tried to introduced myself to her, but she said to me in a very snobby voice ""Are you here to make friends or work?"" and she refused my handshake. And just today, she was pilling on task after task after task onto me. I would start my first task, then she'd come to me with a new one, and then a new one not long after that, and so on and so on. It reached a point where I had to clock out and she had the audacity to roll her eyes at me when I told her that I couldn't finish everything that she had assigned me.

Today after work I talked to an old friend who's been working at Target for nine years and he's told me that the high turnover rate has been solely because of Beth. He even told me that other Team Leaders have quit because of her. He's informed me that a majority of people who have quit have all done so without notice. He then finished things off by saying ""Fuck 'em."" I told this friend (we'll call him Josh) that I'm already thinking of leaving again and quitting without notice once I get a new job. Josh was pissed to hear that and he said to me that I need to show more loyalty to the company that took me back.

The past few days have been a sample of what it's going to be like working under Beth: Being piled on with 8 hours worth of work in a 5 hour shift and constantly being bitched at. Working at Target previously was a big toll on me, both mentally and physically and I don't think that I can do it any longer. Would it be wrong for me to quit without notice in this situation?

1,"AITA for expecting my girlfriend to drive me to work? | So, here's some backstory. I (23TM) had my partner (21F) of a year move in with me last month. She works online for a local office, and I work 30min away at a fish hatchery. I have epilepsy and can't drive, and until recently I had been paying a friend quite a bit to drive me to work because my apartment isn't by a bus. Leading up to moving in, my girlfriend had been giving me rides more often, and seemed happy to help. We've never gotten into any argument we weren't able to solve within half an hour or less. We are both very peaceful, we have all of the same hobbies, and just generally get along great.

&#x200B;

We both like more traditional relationships. I would never expect anything of a partner other than being equal, but right from the start she made it clear she wants to be a homemaker, cleaning and having me come home to hot meals every day, and eventually we want to adopt and raise kids with her at home. It is a relationship dynamic that works well for both of us as she doesn't do well with traditional jobs (anxiety), and most of the time I don't have it in me to cook or clean when I get home. I do not ask her to pay rent because she doesn't work very many hours, but she does pay for our groceries, our cell phones, some dates, and is all around a very helpful person.

&#x200B;

Today, she brought up how it is inconsiderate for me to assume she will give me a ride to work every day since she moved in. She isn't even mad that I didn't formally ask her, she just that she thinks it's too much for me to expect. I tried to explain how I felt to her and apologized for assuming anything without talking about it first. I also mentioned I felt it was something you should just do in a long term relationship. I did NOT say that I feel I deserve rides because I pay rent, or say/even think anything like that, but the way she reacted made me feel as if I had shamed her or something when I have never mentioned anything like that, just the rides. She shut me out for the rest of the day, and I had to pay my friend to drive me when I really didn't have the money. When I got home, she was asleep.

&#x200B;

My least favorite thing is being shut out and not being able to resolve things immediately, and she knows this. There is nothing barring her from being able to do this, she can work whenever she wants so it doesn't hinder that, also it's not money because she is able to save tons by not paying rent. She often goes out when I'm at work (which I don't have any problem with, she can go out whenever she wants), so she is driving anyway. I don't think it's too much to ask for, but she does, and even said that she doesn't want to feel used for rides, but I don't want to feel used either. I do realize that she would be spending 2+ hours a day driving me which is the reason I'm questioning if I'm completely wrong on this one..

0,"AITA for being angry about my s-I-l (age 25) suddenly announcing that she’s getting married 2 weeks before my son (age 22). | My son announced his engagement 6 months ago, sent out invitations, the reception center is paid for, and everything is set for his wedding. My son’s wedding is less than 2 months away.

This week my sister in law announced her engagement, and wedding date which is 2 weeks before my son’s wedding. Some family members have to drive long distances to come to these weddings and most family can only take one day off from work to go to a wedding. 

Not to mention, this would be a financial strain for most family members to travel 2 times and to buy 2 wedding gifts within a 2 week time frame. The drive times for family are up to 6 hours round trip. Flying is not an option due to cost.

My husband and I spoke with my s-I-l and m-I-l, they refuse to change the date and are minimizing our concerns. They say that if family has to choose only 1 wedding then they can skip hers and people don’t have to bring her gifts. I’m sure that family will pick my s-I-l ‘s wedding because it is their youngest sibling getting married. My son is the nephew and I’m sure his wedding would not be the family’s priority.

Also, our family is very religious and my s-I-l  is getting married in the LDS (Mormon) Temple. My son is not getting married in “The Temple” so family will already view my son’s wedding ceremony as far inferior. So again, I am sure family will choose my 
s-I-l’s wedding first.

My son and his fiancé feel that their wedding will be overshadowed by a wedding 2 weeks prior to theirs and they are VERY upset about this.

Lastly, my s-I-l has always treated my son with indifference, disregard, exclusion, and has shown extreme favoritism to other family members in their age group. I’m wondering if this fact is why I am so angry.

Prof: I guess not-

Also I apologize about formatting I’m on mobile. 


Hi! I recently moved into a rent house in February. Prior to moving in I made an agreement with the landlord that I would clean the house, pressure wash, and take care of the yard for exchange of a discounted deposit and rent. The previous tenants of the home left without paying and left it a wreck. Anyways, the yard had been overgrown for the better part of a year, so very high grass and weeds. I don’t have a huge yard but it’s definitely pretty big, I’d say around 30x50 combined. My across the street neighbor was friendly at first, the guy had been laid off work for 5 years and wasn’t all there but we often chatted everyday when I got home from work. He was injured and let me know he gets paid about $4,000 monthly. He offered to cut my yard just like his, and his looked great for $60. I gladly paid him because after work, cleaning the house, and taking care of my daughter I was relatively busy. We had a pretty fair relationship, he would call me if he saw any body sketchy near my house, or pick up my garbage can out of the road, just neighbor stuff. Last week he asked when I wanted him to cut my grass again because it wasn’t bad whatsoever. I told him that, he doesn’t need to worry about it because it hasn’t overgrown. I came home from work that night and it was cut so I went over and knocked and thanked him and we spoke. He asked about these boat trailers I had in the driveway that belonged to my landlord and if she was willing to sell them. I spoke with my landlord yesterday, and gave him a call this morning just letting him know the information about the trailers, he then texted me asking me if I was planning to pay him for cutting my grass last week. I didn’t want to seem rude, so I agreed and asked if $20 was okay, my neighbor responded by saying he’s only going to charge me $50 for it. I let him know that was a bit expensive, and I’ll pay him this time but in the future I’ll cut it myself. I make okay money and I’m a single father, I can afford it but I don’t really have the expendable income to spend on yard work I can do myself.

My son is playing baseball competitively this year and we spend a lot of time on the weekends training before he starts high school. He’s really into it and I like helping him get better.

My stepdaughter will come into the yard while we’re practicing and insist on participating. I asked her once to let us be, and my wife crucified me for it.

1,"AITA for eating one of my sister’s lactose-free snacks? | So, for background, my sister [19F] is lactose intolerant. We only found out recently and she’s the only one in the family. She normally lives in another city for university but she had to come back to live with my mother and I [16M] due to recent events.

My mother buys separate snacks for my sister since the “normal” ones all have lactose. The lactose-free ones still taste good but they cost a lot more so my mother also buys the normal ones so that she doesn’t have to buy more of the lactose-free ones. So, basically, only my sister eats the lactose-free ones.

I suspect that my sister still eats some of the normal snacks since they have been eaten a lot more quickly ever since she moved back in and my sister does still complain about the intestinal problems that led to us finding out she's lactose intolerant.

So, the other morning, I got up to have breakfast and noticed that there were no normal snacks left. What I did notice is there were still two lactose-free snacks left. 

I don’t normally eat the lactose-free snacks because it feels wrong since they were bought for my sister. My mother has never explicitly said not to eat them, but since my sister theoretically can’t eat the others, I don’t want to eat the lactose-free snacks since we have less of them. But there were two and I knew that we’d buy food that day and get more. So I figured that if I ate one, she would definitely still have one for herself if she hadn’t had breakfast yet and she’d get more later on, anyway. So I decided to just eat one.

I didn’t think much about it until later on in the day my sister noticed and got really angry at me for eating her food. I explained that I didn’t think it was wrong because it was one of the few things left and I didn’t finish the snacks, but she said it’s wrong in the first place for me to eat her food because she can’t eat the other.

I think I acted wrong afterwards because at that point I got angry at her and told her that it didn’t matter because she ate the normal snacks anyway and it was her fault that they had finished when they were supposed to last us longer. She then said that it wasn’t true and that I was lying, and I suppose it’s true that mine is just an assumption and I don’t really know. But I think that my point about not finishing the snacks still stands.

Now she’s still angry at me and my mother told me I should just apologise to her so that the fight ends but I don’t think it’s fair because I don’t feel I did anything wrong. I think maybe I think she’s the one who should apologise to me for getting mad at me over eating a snack. My mother even said that all the food is for everyone in the house and neither of us should get mad at the other for eating any of it when we’re hungry. Am I really TA in this situation?

0,"AITA for declining a commission from my Mother who doesn't intend to pay me? | Just had an argument with my Mother who assumed I would make a large painting (that would take upwards of 20-30 hours of work) for the kitchen in their newly renovated house.

For context, I don't make art for a living but I've taken on minimal commission work in the past and I often make artwork for friends and family for free because they appreciate my art (sometimes they try to compensate me with gifts or money but I always decline). I'm still in university and still in the learning process when it comes to the methods I work in.

The main reason I've declined to make this painting is due to a history of my mother's lack of appreciation or acknowledgement of my art. Throughout high school, I experimented with a lot of different styles of artwork with differing subject matter (a lot of portraits, still life, and anime characters). My other family and friends tried to find interest in my art and were able to appreciate that I was trying something new and doing what I love. My mother didn't make an effort to acknowledge or appreciate my art during this phase of my life. She only fancies artwork that I've made in the past during Art lessons and in elementary school which don't reflect myself as an artist and are only training pieces.

So, my Mother wants me to make a painting for the kitchen, she's mentioned this idea in the past but I haven't agreed to anything yet up until this point. The painting she wants done is not in my expertise and will take much longer to make than normal paintings and will require research, practise, and has a high risk of error. She assumed I would both agree to take on this project and do it for free with no further discussion. I, of course, said no, and that I would only consider taking on this project if I was going to be compensated for my work. She got REALLY mad, saying that she does a lot for me and that I should at least be able to appreciate her by making this painting. I stood my ground and said that I wouldn't consider the painting unless I would get some form of monetary compensation.

I feel a little badly because she is my Mother and we've been going through a rough patch for a few years. Due to current events, I have more free time than usual, however, I still have classes and school work to complete, so I can't just take on a giant project rn.

I was tasked with bringing in some cupcakes for a birthday party that we where holding for my cousin (4f) I refused to carry them but my auntie told me I had to help some how and figured this was the easiest way as everything was pretty much done, I refused and was not listened to so I grabbed the cupcakes and went to put them on the table, just before I could do that I had a tic and dropped them on the floor.

My auntie got incredibly mad as she spent ages on them.

Unfortunately most of the family have sided with my auntie as they have never really accepted that I will live with these tics for the rest of my life so I’m now being blamed for destroying 30 cupcakes that my auntie spent ages making.

I’m now worried I did actually fuck up as I can “hold” them in it just causes me to have a pain in my body so I could have held it in and done the cupcakes",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness
1,"AITA for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising? | So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she’s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I’m hungry. 

I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I’ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it’s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter “where’s the rest of my steak?” and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don’t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it’s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it’s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

I’m complaining to my girlfriend and she’s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I’m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. 

When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that’s where we’re different, I don’t let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don’t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald’s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It’s now the next day and I’m starting to think I didn’t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn’t responded to my texts so now I’m starting to think I’m an asshole.

1,"AITA for calling up a mom the day before her son's Bar Mitzvah and telling her to invite my daughter? | My daughter is 13 and attends a relatively small middle school with only ~50 kids in her grade. Everyone in the grade knows each other well, and for the most part all the parents know each other too. It just so happens based on the area that the school is in that almost half of the kids in the school are Jewish. So a lot of these kids are having Bar/Bat Mitzvah parties, and so far everyone that had a party has invited the entire grade. 

My daughter is socially awkward and does not really have friends. She's a very sweet kid, but extremely shy and I've heard that it comes off as her thinking she is smarter than other people (I don't see it, but that's what I've heard). A boy had his bar Mitzvah this past Saturday, and the day before I heard that he invited *literally* every kid in the grade except for a notorious bully and my daughter. I was furious and upset. 

I let myself calm down before calling his mother, and she was clearly uncomfortable over the phone and just said that she let her son choose the guest list. I said that I could understand that even if he was inviting 40 out of 50 kids, but to just exclude two is cruel. Especially since my daughter is certainly not a bully. She did seem to feel bad but wasn't making any move to do anything about it. 

So I said ""I'm planning to bring my daughter to the party tomorrow, is that okay?"" She responded that they can't add another person the day before the party. I said that they invited over 200 people (including family, family friends, and non-school friends) and they can fit one more person, especially since at least one person won't show up. She ultimately agreed, and I ended up taking my daughter.

Nobody knows, including my daughter, what I did, so it's not like the kids at school know and I embarrassed her (as long as the other mother didn't tell people). I feel bad for making the ""demand"" the day before the party, but that's when I found out. I knew my daughter would be crushed after the party if she found out everyone else was invited.

and nobody ever wants to carry them btw

I'm just getting so annoyed so I messaged the group and let them know that I would not be taking them anymore as its hurting my back. they all said that was fine. 

the next day we decided to go out somewhere and I did not bring the cards with me, someone in the group decided that they wanted to play and when I said I left them at home they started telling me off, saying that I should bring them just incase. I told them that If someone wanted to carry them for me i would bring them, they told me that was my job and I should carry them.  I tried explaining how much it hurts my back by doing that and they laughed at me. 

I then got super mad and told them to get fucked and walked off.

0,"AITA for telling my brother if I'm lazy for not working, so is he? | Throwaway - don't this on my main.

I am a 21F in university. I will be taking courses in the summer after a 4 month 'break' to do an internship with a company as part of my degree program. It was a paid internship, and my pay was decent - I made more than double what I had made in the previous 1 1/2 years working part-time.

I decide I saved up enough money that I wouldn't work part-time and take classes over the summer. I'm taking 4 classes, 3 of them quite difficult, so I decided it would be best to take a break from working this semester and focus on my courses. I'm close (ish) to graduating and these courses are very important for my degree. After next semester I'll probably be taking 3 courses in each semester until I graduate so I figure I will be able to work. I do not pay rent but pay all my own expenses at my parents house as well as my tuition. They agree with my decision to focus on courses next semester. 

My brother (30M) is a teacher. In Canada, teachers can either choose to get paid for 12 months of the year (at a slightly lower amount per paycheque) or 10 months of the year (the time spent actually working since they have summers off). My brother chose the 12 month option, and doesn't work during the summer. He has no kids. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with the way my brother chooses to work/get paid. But the other day when he stopped by the house, he asked me about my university plans and I told him. He scoffed and said I would be 'lazy for not working part-time' while I took those courses. I told him he was not in the same degree program as I am and these courses are difficult to balance, and regardless, I saved up enough money from the past 4 months it was basically like I was 'working' since I did have money to use during the semester for my necessities. He reiterated that he thought it was a bad idea he thinks mom and dad should 'put a stop to.' I reminded him he didn't work during the summer because he had cash flow coming in despite not going to work which was similar to my situation, and if I'm lazy for not working this summer, so is he.

He said our situations were completely different and I shouldn't bring it up because at least he's self-sufficient and not relying on mom and dad. I feel like complete shit about myself, but I AM 10 years younger than my brother and he lived at home until he was 25.

0,"AITA for “cheating” my family out of hundreds of dollars? | I have a giant family. My mom and my dad both have a lot of siblings and they’re also both the youngest in their families. This means I’m nearly the youngest of over 20 cousins. We all live close so we throw gigantic family get togethers. All the time.

My grandparents own a pretty big ranch just outside of town. They’re not rich by any means, but land is cheap out here and they’ve owned the property for a long time. Because these gatherings sometimes attract upwards of 40 people, their ranch has been the venue of choice for as long as I can remember.

My uncles are all stereotypically masculine dudes, as are a lot of my older cousins, so our rendezvous generally revolve around sports, grilling, and gambling. Gambling isn’t exactly my cup of tea, but I participate for the sake of being social. I usually lose a fair bit of money because I don’t play cards or know sports teams as well as everybody else. It’s gotten to the point where it’s become a reoccurring joke amongst family members.

Well this time around we have an especially large gathering. So large that It’s determined there’s too many people to coordinate our typical gambling games. To make things simpler, my aunt comes up with an idea. She fills a jar full of beans and places it high up on the mantle. She tells us it’s $20 a guess and whoever guesses closest to the number of beans inside gets to take home all the money. 

For whatever reason this new form of betting got everyone in an especially adversarial spirit. Almost all of the adults participated and many even made multiple guesses to increase their odds. 

Remember how I’m typically ignorant when it comes to gambling? Well this time I was in my element. I could tell the jar was a typical 64oz mason jar, which a quick Google search told me was 116 cubic inches in volume. I also found that a bean was about 0.15 cubic inches. Divide the jar by the beans and I got 773. Then I assumed 20% of it was air, which left me with ~619 beans. To be safe, I made two bets: one for 610 and the other for 630. 

As I’m making my bet, people are giving me crap like “it’d be easier if you just gave it directly to me” and all the other usual ball busting, but I just smile and say nothing. Some can tell something’s up and continue to give me grief for the rest of the night.

After probably 40 minutes of interrupted counting, my aunt informed everyone that not only had I won, but both of my guesses were closer than anybody else’s. 

At first everybody was super happy for me, laughing about how lucky I am. One of the suspicious cousins from earlier asked how I did it, so I told everyone my strategy. Immediately I could see people’s faces start to sour. One of my uncles said “that’s bullshit” and left the room. 

It ended up being nearly $1100. My parents tell me that I should offer to return it because I didn’t earn it fairly. I argue that I had all the same information as everybody else.

I was gone for about 1 minute. When I came back, an old man of about 70 was standing there. The meat man finally finished the customer he had originally been serving and then he looked at me and asked how he could help

The old man yelled and said I was here first. He just got here. The meat man tried to explain that I had just stepped away but the man wasn’t having it.

I am leaving for London in 9 days. I have a rather big apartment back home where I already have 2 roommates. I've always known that when I leave for London I would have to find a third resident. 6 months ago my very close friend came to me, and asked very politely if he could move in when I leave. The two other roommates were not my friends prior to moving in so they don't know the actual rent. They pay a rather low rent for the average rent in the area but they actually pay 80% of the rent where I pay the remaining 20%. I pay for everything else in the apartment and it is my apartment on paper too. I figured I was gonna get a third roommate who would pay the same amount as the other two, so I would have more money for London.

My friend however knows how much I pay, and he asked if he could move in and pay the 20%. Both he and I have always been bad with saving up money and I knew he really needed a lower rent so I agreed on a few conditions. I wanted him to take over the room with my furniture so I didn't have too pay for them to be stored. He agreed. I also didn't want to stress about the move because that was the last thing I needed. He knew I was doing him a favor so he went along.

I have been rather stressed and in a terrible mental condition ever since and just really need to leave for London for a fresh start. He knows this. We both smoke way too much weed, and I want to get away from that. A month ago he got a new job that pays a lot better. Now he wants to stay at his current apartment and not move in at my place.

I had recently moved back to my hometown after living in another state for over a year. Three friends had not really kept in touch with me while I was gone but after coming back we hung out a few times and things seemed fine.

I left work an hour early so I could get groceries/drinks then home and clean. 

5:00 comes and I haven't heard from them. I text to ask when they will arrive. One girl writes me back saying they went into the city during the afternoon and got a bit caught up, but they were on their way. Cool. 6:00 comes. I text again and one of them says that they had to stop at her place to feed her dog, since it was dinner time they decided to make dinner and then they will be on their way.

I hadn't really told them I would have food, but it seemed rude of them to make another stop without giving me an update and to go ahead and eat without me. I guess they assumed I would just eat on my own? I was expecting them at 4:30 I can't imagine why they thought I would be eating alone. 7:00 comes and I haven't heard from them.

I got a very lengthy all caps response saying they had driven all that way (about 30 minutes) to see me and couldn't believe I would do that.

There is a main front door and then a 5x5 “mud room” and our apartment doors face each other. We essentially live in one very large room with a wall down the middle.

Our neighbors are not sociable. Totally ok with us. In fact in two years we have spoken to the Dude , twice: once a year ago, once tonight. The woman has never made eye contact with us.

We live in New England and it snows. A lot. Last year when they moved in Dude knocked and asked my husband to move his car to the far left space in order for the plow to clean out our two spaces and his GF space. My guy works at home so he said no problem. All last winter, all this winter, he moves the car before work at 9am and back at 5pm.

Tells him that I didn’t move my car today (went to work at 730am - and uh, not home when you pounded?)

After a few minutes I noticed he was passive aggressively slamming the clothes around so I asked what was wrong. He claims I should be helping him because there is so much to finish. As far as I was concerned my chores were done! I don’t want to be the bitch but when I was washing, drying, and sorting several loads he was playing Xbox. When I spent three hours making a meal from scratch, he took a nap. It never occurred to me to bitch at him for relaxing when I completed my agreed upon chores. Is it wrong of me to want to relax now? Does the fact that I’m female change the expectation? I am an executive in the corporate world and I’m worried that my way of thinking is too black and white, because I relate this situation to duties assigned to my employees. I can also be known as a hard ass. Should I approach my home life differently? I don’t know if this matters, but my husband holds a similar position at his job. Maybe he’s feeling frustrated because he can’t delegate his duties? I’m not sure. I need a second opinion. AITA?",False,False,2,4,1,3,1,3,Fairness

She is getting evicted from her house. Her boyfriend, the father of her child, left her. Her life is basically falling apart. I would’ve helped her out, if she had not insulted me. 
 
She asked me if she could live at my place. I was happy to let her in. She then proceeds to say how life is unfair that she works so hard and gets nothing, while I don’t work and become rich. That made me a bit mad, but that wasn’t the worst part. Then, she proceeds to insult my appearance. “You’re still a virgin? Right? Makes sense”. I really don’t think it’s that bad. I’m 22, which is only about a standard deviation from average.
 
Then, I got pissed. I just said “You and your child are not allowed in my house. I’m sorry.” You know, you’re not supposed to bite the hand that feeds you

1,"WIBTA for asking a guest at my kid's first birthday to reimburse us for botched photography? | This might sound super, super petty, but we want a guest at our son's first birthday party to help pay in part for the photographer we hired because she ruined many photos.

We hired a photographer because it's a big day. Our first year being parents and our son's first birthday. We asked people to clear out away from the photographer at key moments because we didn't want people occluding the action. Things like opening gifts, taking a bite of cake, etc. We just wanted to get clear photos of these events and not have people stand in the way.

This guest in question isn't our friend, she was a +1 from one of our friends. I guess she didn't get the memo because she's in all of these shots. It's really not a big deal if she's in the corner or just slightly in frame on the sides, but I mean trying to put her face next to our son's face as he opens presents so she's center frame, doing bunny ears above his head, etc. 

The most egregious example and what prompted us to want to ask for reimbursement, was we put a dab of cake on our son's nose for a photo and her cellphone in her outstretched hand is in frame. Her phone's on and has Tinder on screen.

I don't blame our photographer. Things move fast with a toddler and things can be unpredictable. He frames, points, and shoots continuously, there's no time to stop, ask people to move, etc because in a moment the moment is gone.

We want to reach out and ask her to pay $100 for ruining these photos. We paid $800 for the photographer for 4 hours. All of the most important shots are ruined and cannot crop them to fix them. We wouldn't demand it, we'd ask, and if she said no, well then we never want to see her again at any function.

Today I am taking my kids to see their grandfather and I am planning on confronting my ex MIL.  So, as title states, my daughter (15) attended the party and there is a $15 secret Santa gift exchange.  My daughter and I went to an upscale store and she purchased (with her own money I might add) a beautiful ceramic Christmas tree, some Christmas tree shaped bath bombs (both items cost approximately $17 together and we still have the receipt) and she included a small painting she made to boot.  She’s no artist but, I thought the concept was adorable - it was a mini canvas with a magnet to hang on the fridge, she painted a small Christmas themed painting.  

Anyway, my daughter tells me the other day, after being frustrated with my ex MIL for not inviting her and her brother to a family picnic, that my ex MIL confronted her about the gift she gave at the party and accused my daughter of regifting/recycling the gift.  Mind you, my ex husband (father of kids and son of ex in-laws) is a dead beat, drunk/drug addicted loser who owes me $50K in child support.  

Over the years my ex MIL has said and done some shady shit and I have been suppressing my inner desire to scream at her for the last 10 years.  Example: the last time I saw her I told her we were going to stop and check out the new goodwill near their house and she says to me, “Oh, I love the goodwill but I’d never be able to wear someone else’s clothes - that’s so gross!  Aren’t you afraid of bugs and germs?”.  I wanted to leap across the room and choke her but, I didn’t.  Instead I just sat there calmly and just smiled at her.  I am a struggling, single mom, they know this.  They also know their loser son doesn’t pay any child support nor has he bothered with calling/seeing them for several years now.

Please don't roast me too hard, I am willing to change of the court of public opinion finds me to be TA. For context, I am turning 30 soon and I am a woman. Also American.

Situation 1: my friend and I arrive to a busy cafe with a moderately long line. Most seats are taken, so we find a table that seats two, lay our coats on the chairs, and get in line. We noticed a pair of young women just a bit younger than us rolled their eyes and just left the cafe. We felt a little bad but I also thought that it would have been just as easy for them to think ahead and mark seats for themselves, so why was it wrong for my friend and I to do this? 

Situation 2: a group of 6 of us were going to a busy burger joint. This place has many seats for 1 or 2 people, but few spaces for s group like ours. As we waited in line, I was watching the tables like a hawk and the second one cleared up that had room for all of us, I sent my friend's husband with our coats to hold the seats for us. The couple in front of us in line gave a dirty look and said, ""They stole OUR seats!!"" (They found a seat within moments of ordering their food and we made nice with them). Again, in this situation there were two people and one of them could have gone off to nab a little 2-person booth or something but they insisted on staying together and so weren't able to reserve their places. I especially didn't feel guilty in this situation because we had to seat 6 of ourselves and that is much harder to find than seating for 2 and most people there were only in pairs.

I work a pretty sweet gig at a vet office, he goes to university. We have an agreement, he is the only one with a car (parents got it for him when he got accepted in his current uni program) so he drops me off and picks me up from work, and I do all the cooking and cleaning at home. Yeah, we are the kind of family where mom would have a heart attack if she saw *a man doing household chores*. Whatev, that works well for us most of the time.

Yesterday, I was waiting for John (at 4:30pm) after work, as he usually picks me up then. He confirmed by text he was on his way, but time passed and he didn’t show up. At 5:15, I called him to see if he had a problem on the way, but he told me “Oh, I was feeling tired so I went straight home, just take the bus.” If he had told me ahead of time I would have taken the 5pm bus, but now I was forced to wait for the 6pm bus and got home past 7. To be clear, John’s commute is 12 min normally, and 16 if he takes the slight detour to get me (thanks google maps), so it’s not like it would have changed much for him. I do take the bus often to and from work, when our schedules don’t match, but I like to know in advance when that happens.

When I got home though, John was laying on the sofa watching Netflix, AND HE DARED TO BE PISSED AT ME FOR BEING HOME LATE. He said “Fucking finally, what took you so long? I’m starving, hurry up and make dinner.” I just lost it, I screamed at him that I’m not his personal cook and that he didn’t keep his end of the agreement so I’m not keeping mine. I had a sandwich while waiting for the bus, so I locked myself in my room and didn’t cook (John can’t even use a microwave, at best he can throw a salad together). I ignored him pounding on my door and demanding I cook, and I went straight to bed.

This morning, I took the bus to work and was greeted by about a million texts from my parents. They are super pissed off and telling me that they let me live free of charge in their apartment because “it makes university easier for John,” and that they will evict me if I “keep acting out.”

I know they value university a lot and hate the fact I opted out to go straight into the workforce, and I get it studying is hard, but it’s like they only see me as a live-in maid for my dickhead brother.

I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.

I told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. 

She told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line.

So this Easter weekend I've had my father in law come down and stay and he and I both have a pretty good relationship and we often share drinks when we visit each others houses. I work in the liquor industry so my liquor cabinet is quite extensive 

A couple nights ago I offered him a glass of my most expensive bottle that I had bought myself for my birthday, and he declined, saying he'd just have a glass of Jameson's. (It's worth noting I told him how much I had paid for the bottle)

Anyway, fast forward to last night while I was working until late, my fiance called me in the late afternoon because FIL had drank the Jameson and had asked if he could drink mine. (For the sake of fairness i will add he mentioned he would run to a store to replace the Jameson's but I got it for free so I told him I didn't care.)
Naturally I said yeah, as I have 2-3 other cheaper whisky's in the cabinet and I (stupidly) assumed he would drink first before ripping into my birthday drink.

In the time it took my fiance to drive out and pick me up from work (~30minutes) he had basically gone through over half of the bottle, and was on the couch quite drunk. I could probably get 2 very small glasses with what's left 

I probably would've been less pissed off if he had of enjoyed the whisky, but he was chugging it back at a rate of knots.

My mother, grandmother,  and I couldnt help in the move because my mom was in the hospital for months straight (shes so much better now). My great grandma will be 96 this year. 

Ever since I was a little kid, my great grandma has told me that I would be getting a necklace from her, it was my grandma's first ever diamond that my great grandpa gave her. They lived a happy marriage. The thing was well taken care of for it being around 70 years old. She put it in a box and planned on giving it to me either when I turned 21, or for my wedding, or when she passed it would go to me. She even addressed the box to me to make sure I'd get it.

I post my Venmo and Cash App info to the group text. Sisters A and B have still said nothing. So, this past Friday, I text, ""So, I'm just assuming neither of you wants in on this. That's fine, Boyfriend, Older Sister, and I got this. But hey, for future reference, it would be really nice if both of you had communicated with me so that I could've handled this before.""

Well, suddenly Sister B texts back. She has some overly complicated story about why she hadn't seen my texts until just now and that she wants in but doesn't get paid for another 2 weeks. Some quick back story, Sister B is a chronic liar who is very bad with money and can hold down a job for maybe 6 months before getting bored and ""quitting"" (READ: getting fired). We all know the song and dance of Sister B just needing some money and she swears to god she'll pay us back on payday and it never happens.

Basically, she wants credit for the present that our moms are going to ***love*** and also ""eventually"" (READ: never) pay for her share in it. I say, fuck that, if you can't pay by 12/20, you're not in on this.

She whines and tries to get into this very long story about why she can't but promises to pay by 1/1, and I say, no. Pay me by Friday or figure out a present for moms on your own.

I've told this story to some folks and while some said, ""lol, that's Sister B for you,"" it's been heavily implied that I was overly harsh and should give her a chance to pay me back because don't I remember being in my early 20s and not being able to give nice gifts? Whatever. Maybe I do suck.

I moved out of my apartment and gave 45 days notice to my roommates. I gave the notice in November, and paid the full month of December for 2 apartments, so I could move into my new place.  

I was trying to be a nice guy and do the right thing by paying for two places to give my roommates ample cushion on rent. I also took it upon myself to start finding new roommates, with a strong preference on someone to start paying in December, so I could recoup some of my loss. 

My roommate flipped out on me and got super angry that I was moving out. He refused all my candidates for a replacement roommate for anyone who could start paying in December and insists on this one guy, who plans to move in December but refuses to pay me any pro-rated rent. 

I've said that if anyone moves in early, they need to pay me. There is no free rent.  If they don't pay me, then they do not have permission to move in until January 1st. 

My past roommate got super angry and thinks this guy is entitled to move in and stay for free. It pretty clear that they're just going to go behind my back and move him in early.  I already vacated the premises and turned in my keys to the landlord so I can't do a walk through and verify when this guy moves in. Landlord refuses to get involved. 

Since I can't prove what day this guy moved in, I just want to  sue my previous roommate for the 15 days of rent that I overpaid (around $850) Per my lease, I was only required to give 30 days notice, so I have overpaid my rent by 15 days.

He has made efforts to learn it in the past but has become more serious about it. On top of that, there are many different dialects and I am Egyptian so he’s finding it hard to make use of the Arabic we learn.

Every waking moment he asks me to translate something for him or to practise with him, which involves only responding in Arabic to him or translating every word he says in English back to him. When we are visiting my parents he expects me to translate every single word anyone in the house says.

I appreciate his eagerness to learn but it is becoming frustrating. I can’t even ask him a simple question without him requesting me to say it in Arabic. 

Now, when I do that he gets upset for me overly correcting him and when I try to not do that he says I’m not helping him enough. We can’t have a normal fluent conversation anymore.

I said to him that I can’t be his husband and his teacher and that he has to sign up for actual 1-1 lessons. He says that will not be helpful because of the difference in dialect and formality of getting an actual teacher.

Now he is saying I’m unsupportive and not allowing him to get fully accepted by my family. This is a whole other thing not worth getting into but if you’re remotely with intercultural relationships you’ll know what I mean.

I think I can support him without my involvement and would find it easier to help him if he gets a basic understanding of the language first from an actual teacher. It’s frustrating to be forced to talk to him when he doesn’t understand the language but still expects me to start a full on conversation and just go from there.

I learned from a preceptee that an insane amount of my fuckups were recorded without my knowledge and included in various training videos. Other people are included too, but I appear so much that I have a not-very-nice nickname among students. I verified this was actually the case through my own investigation. 

I asked the training department to stop using me in training videos. They refused and it was said that they have the right to use the videos since there was no expectation of privacy on my part. In response, I've quit precepting until they take me out. 

This causes a reasonably big issue in the training program since I'm the only preceptor in this area and they aren't in a position to train more.

I work at a job where I was harassed pretty badly by a senior engineer, it escalated till he groped me and I had to hitt him to stop it. And HR didn't handle it well. I filled a police report too but there wasn't enough evidence for the police or court to do much. My boss knew and he just towd the company line. My coworkers knew and thought it was funny, or thought I was being a crazy bitch. A couple other managers at work were creepy fuckers too, and HR just brushed everything under the rug

Thatt, plus some other experiences in my career, permanently put me off engineering and I decided to quietly work on transitioning to another career field. I started taking night classes, in accounting, passed my CPA exam, and got a job offer as an accountant halfway across the country. I kept all this quiet. 

It was just the type of new start I had needed. 

I was afraid of quitting my stable job and going into something totally new, across the country, with no support network, so I had an idea to cut down on some risk.

I told my engineering job I was taking the month of July off. And I told my accounting job that I was starting the first week of July. 

So for that month, I still technically had that engineering job to fall back on, just in case. But my new job was going wonderfully, and still is. So at the end of July, I sent an email to my old jobs HR department saying that I resign, effective immediately. I didn't say why, but I figure they knew why. They'd have to be dumb as bricks to not figure why.

I got an email back saying that I would need to come in to next day for the exit procedure of turning in my laptop, ID, company credit card and phone, filling out an exit survey, etc. Closing out loose ends and turning over my in-progress work to someone else. And I replied to  that to say that my laptop, phone, CC and ID were on my desk, and I would not be available to come to the office.

Since then, I've gotten a lot of emails asking me details about my work; procedures only I knew, where I had saved documents or work that I had in progress, etc. I haven't answered any.

I've been doing great; it's such a weight off my shoulders to be out of an environment that I always feel stressed and unsafe. And it's a little satisfying that my old co-workers, including the one who i went to the cops and hr about, missed a major deadline because they didn't have some of the knowledge or documents that only I had in that group.

I should firstly make it clear that because we weren't married and had no children I am not next of kin, her parents are.

I discovered today that because the way the Mortgage was set up, I am due to inherit the full mortgage debt to pay back but only half the house, the remainder of the house will go to her parents. This is frustrating for a number of reason, firstly when my fiancee and I set up the Mortgage I recall being asked this question and I don't believe that is the option we chose. I can't prove that so it is what it is. Secondly, the house is hers and mine, no-one else's.. We designed it from the ground up, everything in it is hours of work by us, to now have to share that seems wrong. Thirdly, I truly dont believe this what she would have wanted, it certainly isn't what I would have wanted for her but they're spinning it as ""If this is how she set it up, she must have wanted us to get the house."" And finally I got on really well with her family, I feel this has made the relationship extremely difficult to maintain. 

I'm not sure if it's relevant as to whether IATA but her family are well off, a lot more so than myself or my family. They're not stinking rich but they have a large portfolio of properties and money just isn't an issue for them. I'm by no means struggling, but I earn enough to pay the bills and that's about it.. I can barely afford them now I'm paying them alone.

Also, possibly relevant possibly not.. every single asset of hers has gone to her parents and I have not said a word. This is the law and that's fine. It probably equates to around £20,000 in total, I have not asked for nor received a penny of this and I am completely comfortable with that fact.

Now, we had joint life insurance which means I'm due a payout equal to the remainder of the mortgage. To me, this is my money to do with as I please. I paid the premiums to cover my mortgage in case the worst should happen, which it did. My solution is that I either give her parents half the money we've paid off the house and they sign it over to me or we sell the house and share whatever money is raised. Either way, I keep the life insurance money.

I also wanted to relax and spend time alone. Recently my older sister has gotten divorced and she’s switched from a part time job to a full time so she works during the morning.

I think this is pretty unfair. I also wanted to get a job this summer to get some job experience but that plan was nipped in the bud. I love my nephew. And I don’t mind watching him occasionally. But I’m so tired of this. I’ve been doing this since I got out for the summer in May. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. And I’ve expressed it plenty of times but I get shut down every time by my parents because they say there’s no one else to do it. 

Apparently I’m an asshole for complaining and I get hit with the life isn’t fair. 

I’m not trying to be insensitive towards her and I know she’s having a hard time adjusting but fuck! 

I think I’m going to go crazy soon. My daily schedule consists of waking up at 6. Taking his clothes off. If he cries when he gets here I deal with it. I make his food and I feed him. And then I attempt to get him to go back to sleep. I change his diapers during these times and play with him. I make sure he goes outside at least a few times during the week. At some point he goes down for a nap and I continue to feed him. 

He can only eat finger food by himself. I’m not patient so I get frustrated having to feed him by hand. It takes so long. 

I also brush his teeth, wash his face, and do his hair. 

It sucks so much to be trapped with a toddler 5 days a week. At this point he’s seeing me more than he sees anyone else. I don’t have a child. I didn’t sign up for this. 

I just want to be irresponsible and sleep until 11 AM and play video games all day and chill with my friends. Maybe even work and make some money. I don’t want to be a mom.

So my parents bought me a Logitech G Pro Wireless, a $150 gaming mouse. I was there when they bought it so I have proof they actually purchased it and it exists. However, that was over a month ago, and they still are hiding it somewhere in the house and have been continuously, for the entirety of the last month or so, using it as leverage to get whatever they want from me. 

My idea for some petty ""revenge"" is to just get a part-time job at a fast food restaurant, and purchase the mouse for myself, leaving my parents with a $150 device that they would never use. The return policy is long over, so they would have 0 chance of getting a refund. 

I know I'm doing this with somewhat malicious intent, but I feel that I am 100% justified.

0,"AITA for bringing Kraft mac and cheese to my cousin’s potluck wedding reception? | My cousin “Shirley” (22F) got married last August. Half a year later and my family still won’t stop giving me grief for this, so here goes.

I (28M) was pretty surprised when word got around that Shirley and Brian (mid 20s M) were having a big wedding, about 200 people. Shirley’s family isn’t well-off (my mom has helped my aunt and uncle out with car expenses and stuff like that over the years). I don’t know what Brian and his parents do.

When the invitation arrived, I saw a line on the bottom asking that we bring a dish to pass. I was a little irritated because money was tight and I have a very small kitchen that’s not suited for cooking for more than 4 or 6 people. I had also already sent them a gift off the registry that they linked to on the wedding website that had already been up for awhile.

I have a “famous” in my family moussaka that I make for special occasions. It’s delicious, but it takes me awhile to prepare, and the cost of the ingredients really add up. When I called to RSVP, Shirley said she was hoping I would make about three or four 9x13 pans of it. (I don’t even have one 9x13 pan at home.)

I was pretty honest with Shirley and told her my situation, but offered to pick up a party tray at BJ’s. She sounded really hurt and said she wanted the reception to be a chance to share family recipes (combining the two families and all that), and this would count as my wedding gift. The wedding was a couple hours away where Brian’s family lives, so transporting it would be difficult, but Shirley said “nobody will care if it gets a little cold”.

Shirley said if I can’t bring the moussaka, then I should make another savory dish, “something cheesy”. And be sure to bring three pans of it.

I talked to my sister and I guess Shirley gave her the same speech. My sister said she was going to bring a veggie tray anyways. My mom and my brother, meanwhile, spent the night before slaving over multiple lasagnas. 

I ended up injuring my foot a couple weeks before the wedding. Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to keep things simple. Everyone in the family loves Kraft mac and cheese. So I got three foil pans and I made several boxes. I doctored it up with some parmesan and herbs I had at home and some bread crumbs on top.

When I got to the wedding and finished bringing all the mac and cheese from my car to the tables, I saw my uncle, who was setting up too, and he gave me a dirty look. 

He didn’t say anything but later it got out that Shirley and Brian were *livid* about the mac and cheese.

My family is kind of divided on it. My sister thinks that’s what Shirley and Brian get for asking people to bring food, but my mom thinks that I was being petty and I should’ve just sucked it up.

0,"AITA for telling GF that if she wanted expensive snacks she was to pay for them? | Honestly, I (28M) never thought I'd have to come here for advice since it didn't seem like such a big deal to me but GF's (26F) friends have been blowing up my phone.

I want to start by saying that I have no problem supporting both of us financially. However, I also support my family as well since my parents are elderly and have health problems and my siblings are busy with school.

Two months before quarantine my GF left her job due to circumstances and we decided it was time to move in together since we've already been together for 3 years at this point. We decided that instead of going through the hassle of ending my lease and finding a new place, she'd just move in with since I lived alone and already paid the annual rent while she lived with her parents.

The entire time GF was unable to find a new job, and would ask me for advice on the situation daily and would go on several interviews every week.

We've been under quarantine for a month and a half now and I understand that it's a stressful time for everyone and we all cope in our ways which is why I've started buying hair and skincare packages while GF started snacking a lot more.

Now both GF and I enjoy snacking on things quite frequently. GF, usually paid for the snacks with her own money while I paid for the weekly groceries along with my snacks but because of her employment situation, I've been paying for her snacks for a month now which isn't a problem.

I'm the one that goes shopping while GF usually gives me a list of things she wants. However ever since I started paying for her, over time her snack requests have started being extremely specific and diverging from what she would usually get herself. Like to the point that I had to ask for assistance to find them as they would be located in the ""Foreign Goods"" or ""Vegan"" or ""Gluten-Free"" section unlike the usual ""Chips and Cookies"" or ""Sweets and Chocolates"" aisle. 

The snacks she's been requesting are not only hard to find but are more expensive and because she wants several things, increase our usual bill by a significant amount. I ended up asking for a separate bill for her snacks and this week her snacks and her snacks alone cost what our WEEKLY groceries were and that was just ridiculous.

So I told her that, but, like, in a much nicer way. I told her something along the lines of ""Babe I have no problem with paying for the things we need but if you want these expensive snacks then you're going to pay for them yourself."" 

She ended up bursting into tears telling me ""Couldn't you just pay for them, it isn't a big deal!"" 

She ended up locking herself in the bathroom and ranting to her friends who ended up messaging me telling me what a piece of shit I was. 

TL;DR: GF wanted extremely expensive snack with our groceries, all which I pay for and I told her that if she wanted them she was going to pay for them herself.

I have a college friend who I haven’t seen in a number of years and wants to visit for a week until New Year’s to watch the ball drop. She told me she will splurge one night in Times Square on Dec 31 and will be on a tight budget for the rest of the 6 days. As such, she asked me if she could couch surf in my apartment for the other 6 days. 

I have roommates and the only way they will allow her to stay for that amount of time is if she contributes to the added utilities she will be using in 6 days. The amount we all agreed to was $25 a night. She did not take it very well to say the least. She said she was just “couch surfing” and she won’t have any privacy anyway so she wasn’t expecting to pay anything. Plus, from where I'm from, you let people stay in your place out of ""sheer goodwill"" so paying is a foreign concept.

Normally my roommates and I don’t charge guests if they’re staying for a weekend, but 6 days in winter is different. We don’t have centralized heating so she will be using the living room a/c heater separately for the entire night plus all the gadgets she’ll be plugging in. We already see an uptake in utilities 1.5x during winter (this is without using the living room a/c) and her staying will overkill our budget.

My husband (28M) and I (27F) been married for three years and lived together for a few years prior to being married. We’ve always handled our finances the same way and he has never expressed any issues with our way of doing things prior to recently. 

Our finances are kept completely separate other than when we pay bills, which we split equally. Every month I add up what we owe for mortgage, electricity, gas, internet, etc., and divide it in half, then tell him how much his half is. He sends me his portion and I pay the bills. I prefer being in charge of this because I have anxiety and will worry constantly about whether or not he paid something on time, and I am also the more organized of the two of us. He’s never complained about this and I’ve even asked him if he minds me talking charge of the bills and he said he doesn’t. He’s happy to just send me the money and forget about it. He says he is still happy with this arrangement, as am I. 

Other than the bills, all of our finances are completely separate. We have separate bank accounts, we both work and both make close to the same amount, but recently I’ve begun making more than him. We could both support ourselves if we lived alone, with some left over. We aren’t rich, but it’s not like either of us is living paycheck to paycheck either. In the past, the only purchases we had to check with each other on were things that affected the other person, such as a new pet, new furniture for the main area of the house, etc., because that’s common courtesy. 

Recently he’s been wanting us to have a joint bank account where we put all our savings, and to talk with each other before making expensive purchases. When I ask him why he says he wants us to be better at saving money, and he wants to feel like we’re building a life together. He never used to care about what I spend my money on, but recently he’s begun getting annoyed when I make expensive purchases. We own our house and are not planning on having children so it’s not like there’s a joint expense we both want to save up for. 

I really don’t want to change the way we handle money. I’m better at saving than he is. He pretty much just blows his money on whatever after the bills are paid, and I put a good amount into my savings account each time I get paid. He doesn’t have any savings, I do. I don’t care what he spends his money on as long as the bills get paid, which they do, and I’m feeling annoyed that he doesn’t extend me the same courtesy anymore. It bothers me that he’s begun complaining about my expenses, even though they don’t negatively impact him at all, and I’m not comfortable with the idea of having a joint bank account since we have very different ways of handling our money.

We've had a lot of discussions where I try to talk her into actually setting aside some time to network and apply at other places, but she never gets around to it.

I always babied that laptop, it looked brand new and ran like new after 6 years. The only work I needed to have done on it was a battery replacement after about 4 years.

It's the nicest thing I have, hell, it's worth more than my car, worth more than anything else I own. So yeah I take real good care of it. 

Last week, my roommate had her niece over for the weekend, and they were hanging out in the living room while I worked at the kitchen table in the kitchen.

I came back to the kitchen and when I walked in, the girl was throwing a total fit, running in and screaming. Then before I could do anything, she grabbed the table and pushed it over. I was shocked she was able to honestly.

My laptop fell and landed on the corner. The screen shattered, the corner got all bent out of shape. The hinge broke. I've since taken it to the Apple store and they've confirmed it's basically destroyed. They recovered my data from the hard drive but the laptop itself is gone.

I asked my roommate to pay me back for it, and she said she'd pay me back what laptops from my year are going for on eBay, $600, so I can replace it

I said that wasn't OK, with a laptop from eBay, you've got no idea what you're getting, how well someone else took care of it. But I'd assume most people didn't baby their laptops like mine. Also the ones on eBay she was looking at were not specced out like mine, they were mostly base models when mine had the top specs.

Plus mine was sentimental to me, it was a gift from my parents when I got into engineering school. It's the nicest thing I've owned and I've had it with me all through school. It's not something that could be replaced with a probably bashed up old laptop from eBay.

I wanted her to pay me for about what it originally cost, $2,700. Or at least $2000 so I could be sure I was replacing it with a mac that's in good repair.

But after I finished my cardio and moved on to the weights, this guy who was already at the weights area asked me to explain what the shirt meant. I think I’ve seen him a few times before. He’s fairly tall and well-built. 


I told him that it was just a funny shirt I found and I couldn’t care less whether guys lift weights. He told me to stop lying and said no girls like guys who don’t lift weights. I told him that’s not true. He then asked me why I’m here if not to look at buff guys. I told him that I’m here to work out and to please leave me alone. He then said he never sees me using any weights over 10 pounds so I’m clearly not here to improve. 


I told him to fuck off or I’ll report him. I think he then said “I know you admiring” or something dumb like that and continued his workout. I was pretty uncomfortable being that close to him so I wrapped up my workout early. I told my boyfriend about this and he did the whole I told you so thing because he already predicted I would piss off some meathead at the gym after I showed him the shirt.",False,False,2,3,1,1,1,3,Fairness|Proportionality

They are able to meet their basic needs with their savings, though I provide them with a monthly amount that allows them to actually enjoy their retirement, and have a safety net.


My dad isn't doing so well, and things are getting complicated with my mom. When my dad passes, she expects to live with me and my wife/kids -permanently. I love my mom and appreciate everything she's done for me, but she is unbearable to be around. She is a narcissist. She is hyper-pessimistic. She is a hypochondriac. She is a control freak, so much so that I don't get 2 seconds with a menu at a restaurant with her before she's trying to decide what I, a grown man, should eat. Not to mention, I simply don't have any happy memories with her. While I was growing up, she was constantly projecting her financial anxieties onto me, ever since I was very young, resulting in my constantly feeling like our family was going to go bankrupt, as a child.


This being said, I just don't think I will be able to enjoy my life with my mom living with us. I am happy to support her to a point where she has a very comfortable life, but if she moves in with us, I feel like I will be very unhappy. AITA?",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness

I knew I would be leaving the city in December, and the landlord and roommate were aware of this.  I didn't want to have to sign the lease, but subleasing isn't allowed.  The two of us signed the lease together, with an addendum saying that the landlord was fine with me moving out part way through and that my roommate could add another person to the lease to take over my part of the rent once I left.  

We had a verbal agreement between all parties (I know, should have gotten it in writing) that that I would be taken off of the lease when I moved out, and I agreed to help my roommate find someone to take over, with the understanding that they would be living with the person, so they have final say over who gets to move in.  

However, of the several candidates I've found, my roommate has turned away every single one.  They expect me to just keep paying rent for the next 8 months while I won't live there, and refuse to sign a form (that's already signed by me and the landlord) agreeing to take me off the lease.  I cannot afford both this rent and the rent in my new place come January, so I told my roommate that if we couldn't find someone to take over my portion, I would have to break the lease and accept the consequences (both of us are evicted at the end of the month, we lose security deposit, and potentially owe the landlord more money).  I realize that this sucks for everyone, but otherwise I'm paying my roommate's rent for them anyway.

I don’t exactly like it, but anytime we tried forcing her to eat our food she’d throw a fit so I gave up. 


Issue:


I was planning to cook with use of ground meat today but realized I forgot to buy it. However, there was some meat apparently bought by my daughter. I took it and cooked a meal that I know she likes and also that the rest of family likes.


However, when she came home and realized I used it she got really irritated with me. She asked me if I took it and I said that yes I did, but I cooked something she’d enjoy. She said that it didn’t matter what I cooked because she had a “meal prep” in mind and now she can’t. 


I have to say that I felt a little offended by her making a fuss about it so I told her to just quit complaining about it and “meal prep” something else. 


She blew up then and told me that I need to pay her back for the meat I used. I laughed because it’s ridiculous, the meat she bought costed pennies and it’s not like I ask her to pay back for the food I buy to feed the family, right? 


She then told me that this is exactly why her and her sister don’t like me and that unless I pay back she won’t speak to me. 


My husband heard everything so I asked him to discipline her, but he said that he’s on her side as she paid for it herself and I’m not only an asshole to use her stuff, but also an asshole because now he will have to pay back money I “owe” to her so she doesn’t feel hurt by my “unfairness”. 


As of now no-one except for my parents speaks to me. Am I insane to think she overreacted and made me look like some kind of villain? Or am I the asshole here?

Our bosses didn't estimate the numbers correctly so at some point during the evening we ran out of the glass for a specific beverage, so we had to temoratily switch to other glasses.

These new glasses had the same measurements, they just weren't as pretty as the actual glasses. So whenever somebody would order this beverege i apologized and explained the situation. Nobody really cared about that and told me that they only cate about what's inside the glass, haha.

Nobody cared exept for one guy. When i told him that we have to temporarily switch to different glasses he threw a huge fit. He called everything unproffessional, the new glasses were ""gross"" and ""ruined his appetite"" (?). This went on for minutes.

- I was never on the lease
- I didn't pay any bond
- I was sub renting
- I gave them 10 workdays notice,  then paid for another 2,5 weeks to make it a month. 
- I communicated everything with them that they need to find another person
- I made all the ads and pictures of the pace
- I made a letter to the landlord stating due to xyz I cannot be in this country anymore and if the rent could be lowered.

I was in this place for 3 months.  All went fine but then hell broke loose. I had to get back home since my family needed me. 
When my roommates (24 f & m) heard this, they pushed me to get on the lease.

 
Furthermore they were understanding, helping me by just talking and I made ads to find someone new.  I had several people coming by the place but they didn't get my room since they wanted someone long term (year+) and between 20-30.

I had to catch a plane and put most of my stuff into storage. 

They couldn't find anyone after 2 weeks and they asked me to transfer rent.  I told them I need to pay for 2 places now so I'll only do 2 weeks for you guys to find someone new.  They were grateful. 

2 weeks later they explode and expect me to keep on paying since they haven't found someone new. It would be my responsibility and they are calling me names now saying they might have to move now etc.

I work from home doing code writing and running reports, etc. I have an office in the back of the house. My spouse works outside of the house. We work opposite schedules to avoid high daycare costs. Weekends we are both off and split the duties. 

I start work very early and my spouse sleeps in. I keep the baby monitor with me and when the baby wakes up, I take a break, wake up my spouse, then I get the baby out of his crib, change him, go get his bottle, and then pass him off to my spouse to feed him. At that point I go back to work. 

Typically around 2 hours later I take another break, prepare breakfast for our son, like eggs with sausage or whatever and leave my spouse to feed him. 

After that, I truly feel as though it's my spouse's responsibility to handle the baby. Then once I'm off work, we split the duties until my spouse leaves for work, then it's all on me. 

The problem is that when I take any breaks after that, sometimes to walk around and sometimes just to use the bathroom, my spouse gets angry if I don't help with the baby. 

For example, the baby needed to be changed but my spouse wanted to finish putting dishes away. They got angry when I said no, they needed to change the baby then go back to the dishes. 

I tried pointing out that while they are at work I handle everything, the entire time, with no assistance. I also pointed out when they get breaks at work, all of their breaks are actual breaks. I think it's only fair I should be able to take one or two breaks without having to do anything during them.

Fast forward to this weekend. I got a job offer at a huge company that will change my life. I'll be making three times my current salary! I'll be managing an international team! So cool

Anyway, I told my gf first and she was super happy for me. I told her I was going to take my whole family out for dinner and tell them then. She offered to pick up a celebration cake.

My gf was quiet today and when I asked what was wrong, she said

First, I offered to pay for the whole thing. I also told her that it's tradition, we always get that cake. It's like if she was colorblind and told us to not decorate the house green and red at Christmas, because she was the only one that couldn't enjoy it

She challenged me and asked if we had a kid who was allergic to strawberries, would my family change the tradition then? I told her I don't know, probably? How is this even relevant?

She said she felt like I don't take her into consideration (not true) and especially not as much as I give for my nephews. She even said nephews are spoiled. I can see her point that they do get a lot of what they want - which is why I got 4 cupcakes - 3 for the boys and 1 for her.

About a month ago Denise texted me asking if I wanted to share a Disney+ account with her because she was thinking about getting one. I agreed. The account is in Denise's name and she pays for it but of course I pay her my share back.

I told Nancy about Denise's decision and Nancy was disappointed but understanding.


About two weeks ago my shared netflix subscription ended. Up until now I shared an account with my cousin but he wanted to cancel his subscription.

Nancy didn't have Netflix until two weeks ago so she and I started a new account under Nancy's name(that fact is important for later).


Denise's parents cancelled Netflix a couple of days ago so Denise currently doesn't have a Netflix account. She asked me if she and I would also like to start a new Netflix account together but I told her that I already share an account with Nancy.

Denise then asked me if I could ask Nancy for her if she(Denise) could also use Nancy's and my Netflix account. I told Denise that it would be hypocritical of her to not let Nancy onto our disney+ account but expect Nancy to let her(Denise) use our Netflix account.

A few years ago, my sister and I received letters that we were named as two of the main beneficiaries on my mom's uncle's estate. When we received the notice, we shared it with our parents. We were honestly not close to our great uncle/communicated with him sparingly during holidays/birthdays. My mother was very close with him growing up, and had continued contact with him.

At the start, we were open with them about what was happening, but their tone in conversations shifted over time, in our opinion, to indicate that they saw themselves more and more entitled to the money. We never came to an agreement on the extent that we would help them, because we were so far off (we gave them very broad assurances like ""we'll help when we can"" as the estate was being worked out, while they made it clear that they thought we were morally obligated to pay the debt outright if we could). By the time that it did close completely \~1 year ago, we already had had several blowup arguments. Our willingness right before the estate closed was probably to give them a monthly stipend but to ask them to sell most of their assets. After it closed, we had a few more VERY serious arguments. As it stands now, I have no immediate plans to help them at all or be in contact with them in any meaningful way (I can go into the reasoning for that specific thing in more detail if needed, but we've had some VERY bad arguments).

She said he scratched her somewhere behind her foot (she was pointing near her heels). I was surprised because I did not know she was even close enough for him to do that. I said ""I'm sorry if he did because I didn't think you were close enough to get scratched.""  Her and her friends kept staring at me without saying anything (there were a lot of awkward silences). So I asked her if she needed any medicine or anything. She said no. Then I asked her well what can I do? She said I needed to take better care of my dogs. Maybe I shouldn't have said this next part, but I told her that she shouldn't come near other people's dogs. Her and her friends had a shocked look on their faces, like ""wow, did she just say that?"" They were speechless after that. 

Her mom came over and started scolding me. She said ""you're 30-something years old and she's only 9 years old. You are not the puppy here."" The kids around her started laughing hysterically at what the mom said. It was kind of humiliating, to be honest. I said ""I didn't say anything..."" (was going to say ""wrong to her"") before she interrupted me and told me she saw my face/body language. She was clearly over-exaggerating about my body language. Then I told her that I already apologized and even offered to buy medicine if she needed it. She said ""we don't want your money,"" then repeats how she's only 9 years old and how I'm not the puppy here. I didn't know what else to say so I just apologized again and she left. The kids were still laughing this whole time.

I was a bit defensive because I really think that she did not get scratched by my dog. My dogs were leashed, she wasn't in close range, her heel got scratched even though her feet were towards me, she didn't say anything even though I walked passed her house several times during the walk on Tuesday (making it almost 24 hours before she said something to me). She could've got scratched by something else, like while she was cutting tree branches or at recess during school.

1,"AITA for buying from my friend’s competitor because she wouldn’t give me any sort of discount for her cupcake business? | Basically my friend Jenny has this little business making specialty cupcakes. I’ve had them a few times before (most recently, when she gave me 6 for my birthday in May). I told her I wanted 2 dozen because my son was having his going away party to college, and that I’d happily pay for them, and she agreed.

Well his party was today, so last weekend, I asked her if she can give them to me Saturday morning. She said she’d get to it and asked if I wanted to Venmo her $95 or use another payment. At that point, I knew her prices were a little on the high side, but I thought it $95 was absolutely outrageous, and asked where she got the 95 from. She said they were $42.50 per dozen and a $10 delivery charge. I told her that it was way too high, and asked if she would be okay for doing it for like 45-50 bucks and give me a friend-discount.

She actually got really offended and got mad that I “had the audacity to ask to give her half of a normal customer”. I said I wasn’t really a normal customer though; I’m her friend, and she and I both know that $95 for some cupcakes was a little outrageous for some cupcakes.

She remained firm and said it was offensive to even ask for that and I apologized and said I didn’t really think it was that big of a deal. Also that I think it’s best that she doesn’t make the cupcakes. She was okay with that. 

Anyways about an hour ago, we were talking on the phone and she asked how the party went. I said it went great and I just gave them some cupcakes from this mom & pop cupcake shop down the street. Until this point, the conversation was normal and friendly, but when I mentioned the shop, she got quiet for a moment and then yelled and said “wait what the fuck, how could you buy from another shop over your friend?” 

I got flustered at the sudden aggression before responding back (probably in the same tone) that shop wasn’t trying to rob me over some cupcakes, and it was WAY more affordable (I paid $65 for them 2 dozen cupcakes, delivered). She said couldn’t believe I would go behind her back because I couldn’t be assed to pay a little more to help a friend’s, especially since I promised her I would months ago.

I told her I’m not obligated to buy her cupcakes, especially if she wasn’t willing to lower it to a competitive price and to honestly call me back when she stops throwing a tantrum. I hung up and she texted me saying “fuck you” so I just ended up blocking her in the end.

My husband said I should’ve just bought from the friend. His reasons were that they already gave us free ones last time and we can afford it the little premium. I told him that it wasn’t even about the cupcakes, it was about the rude hyper-aggressive behavior for being asked for a simple discount, and then getting pissy that I bought from someone whose prices were actually reasonable.

0,"AITA For denying an artist royalties after they already agreed I had 100% permission to use an asset any way I wish | Almost a year ago I was going to do an art trade with a 2D artist in exchange for a quick 3D model based on a character of theirs. Within the week I finished their model and was waiting for my art to be completed (two-part art of a character of mine). It was understood that the art trade was quick for both ends so we both could enjoy each other’s art. 

After three months of waiting, she finally provided one part of the art, saying the other part would be done soon. Over seven months of waiting she let me know that her computer broke and she 100% would not be able to finish her side of the art trade.

Disappointed but understanding, I had to commission another artist for replacement art as I needed it. I offered a copy of the model to the artist as thanks for the small bit she did, and asked permission to sell the model publicly as I needed the money. She said I could sell it. I asked if I needed to alter it to sell, and she said that the model was completely mine and I could do as I wish. 

A week later she gave me a “completed” part of her trade, though the second piece of art was nowhere near the quality of the first part and I told her that I already was in the process of getting another commission, and I do not feel like the art trade was honored. She said that was fine and she was sorry still. 

I held onto the model for a bit, not putting it immediately to sale since I got overloaded with work. Finally I had a break last month so I asked again to double check permission to sell, and she said it was fine. 

I finally put it for sale and someone commissioned me to make a similar model with different features and colors. 

She (the original art trade artist) messaged me out of the blue saying that she is uncomfortable with the changes to the model, and wants me to halt all sales of the original and the alterations. She also added that she would now be fine with sales of the models if she received royalties from them.

I told her that this was not our previous agreement, and I will be honoring what was agreed upon. I include credit to the original concept (her character) with the purchase of the model. I intend to keep selling the model.

When we split, we had to sit down and talk about the dogs. We decided he'd get the senior dog because it was before our relationship and I would keep the new dog. For what it's worth, we both paid into the new dog equally in terms of vet, food, as well as the dog itself.

I'm not a dog person but I tried to make it work. I loved both dogs. But due to my schedule for work and etc, I decided having a dog is not for me. So I gave the dog to a family member who was looking for a dog themselves. To note is the dog now lives some distance, not quite plane distance but definitely ""all day driving"" distance.

Why I might be the asshole is I didn't tell my ex until last week. By this point the dog has been gone a few weeks. He cried on the phone saying that it wasn't my place to give the dog away and he would have gladly *paid me* for the dog if it meant he'd get her back.

She asks Tina, who bought our $750 tickets and who put them all on her card, to see if she can get our layovers switched. Tina looked into it, and we can only get $104 back from our tickets. So we would have to spend at LEAST another $750 for a NEW set of tickets (probably more expensive for a different layover location). Joanne says it’s worth it because of our “safety”. Tina and I think this is total bullshit. All of us being 23 years old and holding entry level jobs, we’re not made of money.

1,"AITA? Had a bad date where she walked out on me | Hi Reddit,

I (38m) recently had a horrible date with a girl (37f). The backstory is, we actually went on a date from a dating site 4 years ago. I drove an hour to meet at a place closer to her. It didn't go well. The reason cited at the time was distance as I was an hours' drive away and she only wanted something ""5 minutes away or so"". She also seemed to hint I wasn't at her ""level"" of success, though we both wanted something long term. For background, she's got a PhD and has a successful career. I had a masters, but was still relatively early in starting up my career.

Fast forward to present day, and lo and behold, we match again on a different app. Only this time, I've moved for a new (significantly better) job and am about 5 minutes from her neighborhood she's stayed in for the past 4 years. The first red flag was she had NO recollection that we had gone out before. How many different people have you dated if you don't remember ever meeting up with me? Anyway, we chat on the app and find she's super stressed and burned out all the time at work. Her dating life hasn't been going well as she's still on these apps 4 years later. In the same neighborhood.

I offer to meet up with her again. I'll also admit she's very pretty. We meet at a bar and go over what's been going on. She still doesn't remember me, but talks about her most recent ex from a couple months ago. The guy didn't want anything long term, requested an ""open relationship"" from the beginning when they started dating, lived very far away, was emotionally unavailable (her words), her friends hated him, and they dated like this for 12 months. In my mind I'm thinking this just sounds like an extended booty call, but keep silent. She then mentions she has high expectations for a significant other, and won't compromise, which is her choice of course.

This all sounded hypocritical given everything I'd learned about her and how our original first date 4 years ago went. When we originally met back then, I was ""too far"" away, and not at the proper success level. Now I find she's okay with doing an open relationship with someone who lives far away and doesn't want anything long term? On top of that, she mentions she wants to be married and have kids eventually. I mention that might be hard to find if you're not willing to compromise, and those guys who might meet her checklist criteria could be douchey as well (see her ex), and I could see her getting divorced if that happens. I didn't say this in a mean or lecturing sort of tone. She then flips and says she's gonna leave now, and immediately walks out. I sat there for a moment, finished my drink, picked up the tab, and left. I think about it and laugh a bit now given the absurdity of the entire situation. Was I an asshole here?

I walk into this certain coffee establishment and don’t see my drink at the mobile order pick up. No problem, I figure the barista hasn’t gotten to it yet so I’ll wait. I’m waiting for what seems like a very long time, and I’m debating interrupting the barista to ask if they saw my order. Right as I’m about to do so, an older man (maybe about mid 40’s) walks up to the counter and says he accidentally picked up the wrong order. I look at the cup in his hand and see my name on the mobile order sticker. The man says he just noticed the name was wrong. The barista looks over at me, watching, and says to the man, “I think you took her order.” The man turns to me and says, “I’m so sorry, I ordered the same thing, I didn’t even think to look at the name, I’m so sorry.” Obviously, this guy didn’t mean any harm and I can understand how if you’re busy you might accidentally grab the wrong cup. So, I smiled at him and said it was no problem and that I understood. 

At this point, I expected the barista to offer to re-make my drink, as it was touched and possibly altered by another person. Instead, the man passes the drink to me, finds his proper order and sits back down at his table. The barista goes back to making other drinks. I stand there for a moment, unsure what to do, when the barista looks over at me again and says, not kindly, “Are you waiting on something else?” I looked down at the drink in my hands and then back to the barista and say, “I’m really sorry but could you re-make this?” The barista replies, “is something wrong with it?” I say something along the lines of “well, that guy took my drink and I don’t know if he drank out of it or did something to it, I would really appreciate it if you would re-make it just to be safe.” The barista rolled their eyes at me, and reached forward and roughly took the first drink from me. They then said, “you’ll have to wait for me to get through these orders first,” meaning the drinks she was currently working on. I said that was fine, and that I’d wait. 

I kid you not, I stood there for a good 10 minutes while they made two lattes. I could feel my face getting warm and it felt like every clank of their pitcher was directed at me. 

Finally, they re-made my drink and said, “here.” as they placed the cup on the counter, almost knocking it over. I said a quick thank you and apologized again and got the hell out of there.

0,"AITA for keeping my Father's ashes? |  I'll give as much context as I can because I believe I'm 100% in the right and, if I'm not, y'all will need as much of it as I can give so as to dish out the proper verdict.

My Father recently died and he was cremated. I was there for the entire ordeal and, before I left, I took part of his ashes. Everybody knew about this. I bought a little 3 oz. urn to keep them in.

For X-mas, my sister invited everybody to her small ass house to ""spread his ashes"" in the streams of where she lives. I didn't approve of his ashes being spread in the first place. He didn't live there, didn't like that environment, and lived most of his life in the hot and humid state he was in. If we were going to spread his ashes, we should have done it there. I also did not approve of her inviting everybody to her house as it would be myself, my Mother (whom my Father divorced and despised), and my Father's fiance. That entire situation just sounds like a terrible idea and I refused to be apart of it.

As everybody can tell, I don't have a wonderful relationship with my sister and despite that being one of my Father's regrets before he died, we've been unable to improve that relationship. I make every attempt to be polite and respectful but just so everybody knows, I honestly can't stand her.

Anyway, I gave ownership of his ashes to his fiance and with the exception of the small bit that I had, I told her she was allowed to do whatever she wanted with those ashes. X-mas went down, everybody showed up except for me (I politely declined), stupid drama happened (as I knew it would) and they spread his ashes into a stream. Everything was done.

Or so I thought.

My sister contacted me a few hours ago and asked if I had some of his ashes. When I told her that I did, she demanded that I give over half of what I had. I basically told her that wasn't going to happen. We got into a ferocious argument and it ended with me hanging up the phone on her in mid yell. I've since been bombarded with phone calls and messages from my mom and my Father's fiance about how he was her Father and that I need to give up half of the ashes.

My argument is that she had an entire human minus three ounces worth of my Father's ashes in her possession for months (he died in July) and she never thought to, I don't know, take some of them and keep them for herself? And now I have to suffer from that mistake and give up what small part of my Father that I actually have?

I understand that she made a mistake and now doesn't have any of my Father's ashes. I also understand that by not giving up half of what I have, I will basically guarantee that we'll never have a good relationship. I feel bad about it but only because I know that her and I having a good relationship was what my Father wanted most.

When I got my ultrasound, the lady showed it to me (she wasn't supposed to but did anyways to calm my nerves), and there was definitely only one and she didn't mention there being twins. I was 9 weeks at that point.


When the actual doctor came to see me later, he said it was twins and that it was hormones causing the pains.

When my husband picked me up and asked what the doctor said, I didn't mention the mix up about twins and just said it was the baby hormones plus an infection making me hurt (which was true). He had mentioned before that he could never have twins and he'd want to abort if I was pregnant with them, so I didn't want to make him freak for no reason.


Anyways, me and my mom were talking and she asked what I thought it would be, and then said ""oh or what if it's twins and you get one of each!"". I laughed and told her about the mix up at the doctor, but that it's definitely just one. She then started to go on about how it's going to be twins and that I'm the generation that's due for them.

This woman was trying to get off as soon as the plane touched down, despite being at the very back and taking up all the aisle space. She was already arguing with the flight attendant, when she made some kind of motion and inadvertently smacked me in the face. Not hard, barely even stung, but I was already tired and fed up with her. When I get on planes, I make an attempt to not interact with anyone, even the people I fly with. I either sleep or listen to music. I get a drink from the flight attendant once or twice, and that's all the talking I do in an 8 hour flight. 

Well, I got up, squeezing by the lady and started telling her to shut up. (The woman wasn't fat, but she was partially blocking my aisle, so I couldn't have gotten right up anyway) Yeah, I know, I could have started off with a nicer choice of words, but my tone wasn't hostile. It was more like ""can you please just shut up and go back to your seat? You'll be off the plane in <30 minutes"". This lady, who we can call B (you know why) directed her attention to me, and started telling me that I'm being an asshole to her and I'm ruining her flight. 

That set me off, and I called her a few names. A loose paraphrase of the conversation follows:

M (me): I'm not ruining anything.

B: You're causing a scene and blocking the aisle

M: Shut up you idiot, I'm just telling you to go back to your seat. 

B: I have a child, I need to leave first, in case he needs to potty. (I remember she did use the word ""potty"")

M: Use the plane bathroom you dumb bitch!

FA: Both of you need to sit down, and we can begin deplaning

I sat down after, already fuming, and when we were getting off, she was grabbing her bag from the overhead, complaining about her ""treatment"" when I walked by. I dropped a comment under my breath, ""Idiot"" and started walking away. She caught up to me in the terminal, out of breath and looking pretty angry. She argued with me up until my parents saw me, and came over to greet me. They asked if I had gotten a new girlfriend, when I answered with

""No, just some moron I was on the plane with.""

What I did do was borrow a friend's old fashioned pen (wood with metal tip) and ink bottle and try to write a letter with a bit of flair (I did traditional calligraphy back in school, but it's rusty now). I saw a letter as not disturbing the spirit of ""no gift"" agreement. 

On Christmas I gave the letter and what I received were gifts of substantial value (after currency conversion ≈ $180USD). There was much disappointment on her end as I didn't buy a gift and a letter was seen as a ""cop out"". I felt very awkward as I thought the agreement was no gifts. I tried to say return the gifts as we agreed

There's been some tensions about this and discussions that I should have understood that ""no gifts"" really means ""yes, gifts"". Some friends and family have told me that I have to learn when no means yes. I'm getting told a ""no"" is contextual by my significant other, however I find this stupid. My main argument back was that the definition of ""no"" has to be consistent otherwise the word loses its meaning.

However now there's this passive aggressive spat going one that I constantly seem to be the bad guy in. Anytime I ask ""do you want me to do X household thing? (iron her clothes, take out garbage when half-filled, etc.)"" I get told ""no"", then when I don't do it I cop flak because I should have taken it as a ""yes"".

0,"AITA: Dad is livid because I asked him not to bring new girlfriend to my wedding |  

Backstory: My dad is the type to constantly be in and out of new relationships. Lately they've lasted around a year. I find it exhausting to constantly be involved with new women, and have expressed that I don't care what he does, but I'd like to not be involved.

Last night, my fiance and father had a conversation where we all agreed to place boundaries on the relationship between us and his girlfriend (this one's been about eight months) - namely that we would only have to be around or interact with her when it had to do with my sister (who is about 8 years younger). This is especially important due to our closeness in age with his girlfriend - my fiance has run into people she's gone to high school with that happen to be friends with this woman while we've been visiting my father and it's extremely uncomfortable. 

I'm getting married in about a month. My fiance is having a surprise bridal shower thrown for her on Saturday. Today, my dad texted me informing me that his girlfriend would be his date for the wedding and all wedding related events (including that she would be attending the bridal shower that neither my dad nor my sister or I would be, thrown for my fiance). I told my dad that we would actually appreciate it if he would attend the wedding solo so that he could focus his attention on being the father of the groom, as opposed to on his new girlfriend. Especially since none of the family have met her yet in the 8 months they've been together, and he is the type to likely go around introducing her to everyone, which I think is inappropriate to do for the first time at my wedding. He flipped. He's livid. My fiance and I think it's a perfectly reasonable request given his history and the boundaries we agreed to last night. He thinks he ""needs to fill the void beside him"" and us asking him to attend alone is the ultimate slight. He refuses to come without her, so we will probably cave and allow her to come.

0,"AITA for basically demanding that my burrito be remade? | A few hours ago I went to lunch with my partner and his brother. It was a new local burrito/taco/bowl restaurant like Chipotle that we’ve been wanting to try. 

We ordered on the app to get 15% off and it was delivered to our table. So we didn’t see them make it like we would’ve had we come and waited in the line to order. 

Anyways, our order was a burrito for me, a bowl for my bf, and three tacos for his brother. So everything was different. 

I took a bite into the burrito and all I tasted was rice. Okay, I did ask for extra rice so that could be on me right? Took another bite, still rice. I thought maybe I was just biting the wrong places. So I went to a little bit to the side and took a bite but this time it was just lettuce! 

At this point I just figured it was because it was the beginning of the burrito but nope, I took a few 
more bites and each time only tasted one ingredient at a time. 

I opened it up and I saw that all of the ingredients were just in individual piles in the tortilla. So imagine one part is all lettuce, next to it is a big ass chunk of rice, then a huge dollop of sour cream, all the meat in one part, etc. 

Nothing was mixed together. It’s like they took the tortilla and put a scoop of each ingredient side by side instead of on top of each other. 

There was nothing wrong with my bfs bowl or his brothers tacos. I was visibly upset at how poorly they put it together. I mean there are tons of places like this where I live and I’ve never had a burrito so weirdly made. Even at chain restaurants like Chipotle or Qdoba. 

I don’t think I was rude about it but I just told the first employee I reached in line that I’d like my burrito to be remade. I showed him how it looked and he apologized and got his manager. His manager was annoyed and said I should probably wait in line next time so I can see how my food is being made. Like what? I have to watch to make sure I’m getting the quality that should already be there? 

I told him it’s not my job to make sure a mobile order is made correctly, it’s theirs. I either want a refund or my burrito remade correctly. I’ll watch this time. 

So they remade it the same way I ordered it except this time they did it right (ingredients stacked on top of each other). It was way better ofc, and that was the end of it. 

I don’t blame the employees necessarily because they were all mostly teens or college students like me. And the place just opened a few days ago. I understand mistakes can be made but the manager was an asshole IMO. Plus the restaurant I’m working it is about to have its grand opening in a few days so I’m sure we’ll make mistakes too. But the way my burrito was made just seemed very careless and it irritated me.

1,"AITA for telling my brother maybe he'd have a different perspective if he ever left the small town he lives in? | On a recent trip home to England I got into a fairly robust discussion with my brother about people who choose to raise their children gender neutral. I was in England with my husband as we were visiting my friends and family. I am English but we live in his home country, Australia, where we've lived for 12 years. We get back to visit every 2 years or so. One evening, about 10ish days into the trip my brother, his gf and another friend of theirs came to my parent's house (where we were staying for the duration of the trip) for supper. My brother lives in the same small, rural town as my parents, about a 5 minute walk away. He never leaves this town, other than to go to work in a nearby, larger town. I cooked a meal and we all (me, my husband, my parents, my brother, his gf, and their friend) sat around eating and chatting. It was so lovely to have my family in one room as the relationship between my parents and brother had recently become difficult.

In the context of a discussion about gender fluidity, we began talking about the subject of raising children gender neutral. My brother was adamant that it was a bad way to raise children, whereas my husband and I put forward points that disagreed with him. The discussion wasn't passionate but robust. I argued that kids don't need gendered toys and that an absence of this might give kids more freedom to think of themselves in their own way. Neither my brother or I have children so the discussion was hypothetical. He argued that not gendering children might lead to an absence of workers in certain stereotypically ""macho"" fields, eg. deep sea welders (his example). While I argued that I didn't think this would happen because gender neutral doesn't mean boys can't do stereotypically boy things and girls, stereotypically girl things - it potentially offers children choice for girls to engage in ""boy"" things and boys, ""girl"" things.

I became frustrated that he wasn't picking that up and resorted to telling him that if he ever left the small town he lived in he might get a wider perspective on social issues. I knew it was a low blow but said it anyway. He left after supper, saying goodbye. The next day I received a Facebook message from him stating that he ""didn't want to know me anymore"" and that I shouldn't come back every 3 years and judge the way he lives. I didn't respond because I was hurt, shocked and didn't want to give oxygen to what I thought was an overreaction. He proceeded to cut off contact completely. I haven't spoken or had contact with him in a year now. I recently tagged him in a funny IG post that I knew he'd appreciate bc I wanted to try a softly softly approach to get in touch. He blocked me, and has completely cut me off.

I recognise that I shouldn't have had a cheap dig at him, but I'm really upset that a previously close relationship now no longer exists because of one comment I made. AITA here?

We grew up on a horse ranch in southern California but I moved to Long Beach about 6 years ago. My sister stayed on the property and basically manages because my parents are too ill. 

I have had horses my entire life and my last horse, Comet, came with me for a few months when I moved but as you can imagine boarding in the LA area is ridiculously expensive.

We fight over this constantly, so much so that our parents often have to intervene. I see and care for Comet at least every other month. 

So by the books, I am too ""heavy"" to ride Comet based on the very outdated formula that a horse should carry no more than 20% of its body weight (there is a ton, like metric ton of research to show how false this is, how it's based in stigma, false data and very old understanding of how the horses legs worked). So my sister has ""forbidden"" me from riding MY horse. Her argument is that she cares for him 99.9% of the time and she gets to say. I say he's still my horse. This argument got so bad that I had not been back to the ranch in almost 2 years. 

Well I went back yesterday and Comet was so excited to see me, I got out my saddle and took him for a really long ride. When I got back my sister saw me and I literally thought she was going to pull me off the saddle. It turned into a huge screaming match and I just tuned her out because again it's my horse.

I DM in one and another player (we'll call him John) DMs the other. We alternate saturday nights. We have been playing for around a year, and both campaigns have always been held at John and his girlfriends house (who is also a player in both campaigns)

So around 4 months ago, John and his girlfriend had a baby. This obviously put a wrench into our DnD plans, but we all gave them plenty of space and took a month and a half hiatus. Eventually we picked back up and are playing regularly again, John and his girlfriends parents sometimes watch the baby, other times it just hangs out with us and the parents need to leave occasionally to take care of it.

So a few weeks ago I brought up an idea to John. The idea involved hardware in the walls and he said no. Which is fine, I'm not gonna force him to put holes in his walls.

Now I'm planning on moving out of my parents and into an apartment in the coming weeks, and wish to move my campaign to my place. Theres a few reasons why I want to do this, and it's mostly for convenience. He won't let us leave anything at his place, and hauling all my notes and books and DM stuff to his house every week is kind of annoying, especially since he lives over a half an hour away from everyone else, which is another reason. Lastly is because, as mentioned earlier, I'd like to have my own place so I can modify it how I like, i can have everything set up how i want it and can put in any hardware that i want.

So I brought it up for everyone in the group chat and everyone was for it (mostly because it would be a shorter drive for everyone), except John. He said that my campaign had to be held at his house because it would be too big of an inconvenience with the baby to go anywhere else.

Now I completely understand that that would be a huge inconvenience for John and his girlfriend but like... I'm only asking to change the location of MY campaign, the one that I'm responsible for. His campaign would still he held at his house, but I just feel like it isnt fair that everyone is inconvenienced by the drive and I'm prevented from doing something for my own campaign because it's always held at his house. Not to mention that (and i know i cant back this up) but a lot of it too is because he doesnt want to be inconvenienced in general. He's always been one that has struggled with the idea of something not going his way. So eventually he just said that if the campaign couldnt be held at his house, he will stop playing.

I have a son with my ex wife. We got divorced when he was around the age of 11 ( he is now 16 ). I cheated with another women and she didn’t really managed to “fulfill” me. We aren’t exactly friends but we don’t hate each other. In the other hand, my relationship with my son has worsen since our divorced. He is very distant to me, he seems more close to his mom boyfriend than to me. And it got to the point in which I kinda gave up. I had him each other weekend, at first we went out to see movies or to visit his grandparents. But recently I have seen how he doesn’t seem to care. He doesn’t really want to visit me and there had been a couple of weekends in which he simply decided to not visit me.

So, basically a couple of weeks before Christmas I was planning with his mother what we would do in Christmas and new year. We decided thta j was going to get him in New year and her in Christmas. Out of curiosity I asked her what she was going to gift our son. Apparently because he has been a very good student this last years she decided to buy him a new and better PC ( my son loves videogames and apparently he complained about his computer not being good enough for playing those games ). And this PC wasn’t cheap. I don’t remember how much did it cost but it was considerably expensive. I told her that it was too much money for a gift to a kid. And this started an argument. Like I said, she makes more money than me and thus her gifts are more expensive than mines ( for example a couple of years she bought him a ps4 ). 

My problems with this are two. 1: I don’t want my kid to be a spoiled kid, sure he has been good at school but he hasn’t really worked for it, not even in a symbolic way. I’m afraid that he will believe that his mother will buy him all he wants without working. 2: This is also something bad for my relationship with my kid. Like I said, I don’t have a good relationship with him but I’m trying to fix it. And her giving him these kind of gifts will only reinforce the idea of her being a better parent than me.

So I replied that I don't want anything to do with this child and that she should get an abortion. It's worth mentioning that she lives in a country abortion is illegal, however, I offered to fly her to a country the procedure is legal. She declined. It's worth mentioning here that I have also said that will pay any child maintenance fees, although, I have still made it clear that, aside from my financial responsibilities, I want nothing to do with this child. 

Most recently, she has asked me about ""my boy"" with the implication that I have a relationship with him. I told her that she chose to have a child, not me, and that you have to choose to be a father. I'm a sperm donor. She replied with just OK.

They say they can't handle watching two kids, that he's too hyper, etc etc.

I proceed to go outside and mow the lawn, just as I have my entire life. After I do the front yard I mow the back. On the way back to the garage to drop off my lawn mower, my neighbor approached me. 

This is how the conversation went:

Me: ""Hey, how's it going?""

Neighbor: ""Could you not blow your grass onto my lawn please""

Me: ""I have no control over where the mower puts out its grass.""

Neighbor: ""Can you mow side to side?

Neighbor: ""Yes, whenever I come home from work, there is always grass in my driveway. I pay a lot of money to have the weeds pulled out of my lawn and you are throwing seeds into my grass""

Me: ""Well, I have never blown grass into your lawn!""

Neighbor: ""Then whoever""

First off, I do not have a bag for my mower, because it mulches. It does not blow grass anywhere, it simply mulches it and drops it as you move along further. The grass was pretty long as I said so I was leaving some mulch pockets, but nothing in his yard.

Until then, he's doing the usual summer thing-goof around on YT and read ff. He's enjoying summer like usual.

Now, that might be too far now that he's an adult. He's not doing chores around the house reliably, so I get my dad yelling at him even if it's getting exhausting and isn't really necessary.

The thing is, he acts like 1) it was easy and 2) it's comparable. I worked very hard during school to maintain my GPA and I work until I sweat cleaning the house. It isn't something my brother should just be capable of. Also, my brother is autistic. What works for me will not work for him and comparing my achievements to his will do nothing but make him feel bad-his brain doesn't work the way mine does. It's just not fair.

I told my dad I didn't appreciate these new, constant (daily) comparisons. He told me I have no right to object since he's not insulting me, and since it's his son it has nothing to do with me so I can shut up. But he's literally comparing him TO ME.

TL;DR: My coworker is driving me nuts. She's slow, throws tantrums, lies, and won't listen to me (manager). Boss won't do anything and I have a new job offer. WIBTA if I left (with appropriate notice), and told my boss that she's the main reason I quit?   

Long version:

About 4 years ago we hired Joan. Joan and I went to the same school, and took the exact same program with the same teachers. 

At first, she was a bit forgetful or asked basic questions, but there's always a learning curve starting a new job. After a year she continued to mess up. Customers would get angry or flat out say they were not coming back because of things she did.  

Now, I give her advice or instructions and she will give me 101 reasons why she wants to do it her way. I try to help her with problems she's having, using advice that she normally would have done herself, but she will reject my idea, seemingly because I was the one who said it. 

Recently, she's had tantrums, screaming matches with the boss and myself, and will cry and storm off over really small disagreements. She NEVER apologises for her behaviour. The one time I pushed for an apology she literally got on her knees and mocked me (""PLEeEeASE forgive me, deadleaf28!"") 

Last week, we made a plan that I would continue hole punching some books while she printed her business cards, and when there was a decent amount to coil, she would start coiling. I guess she forgot? Because when I reminded her about it, she blew a gasket. Convo below: 

Me: Hey, I'll take over the punching now, you can go do your cards.

J: No I'm fine.

Me: But.. I thought I was going to punch and you do your cards? 

J: FINE! I'LL DO THE DAMN CARDS! I WILL DO THEM! I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP YOU!! \*runs away\*

Me: What? 

I met her at her desk and she was really angry and crying. (No actual tears...)

Me: What's wrong, why are you crying? I thought that was the plan, for me to punch and you do cards, then coil?? 

J: IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THE STUPID CARDS I'LL DO THEM!

Boss shows up to see what all the fuss is about. Joan IMMEDIATELY calms down, stops 'crying' and says, ""oh, I misunderstood."" 

I feel like Joan is trying to manipulate me into either quitting or losing my cool. The only time I've raised my voice at her was when she was already yelling at me so I could make my point before she ran away. I've told my boss about my concerns and how I really can't work like this anymore. She says she'll hire somebody new but it's been over a year and she's done a few interviews and hasn't hired anybody, and hasn't told Joan that it's not acceptable behaviour. Recently I got a job offer in the same field, with better pay and a better organization.

1,"AITA for letting my kids sing the song from the show ""The Witcher"" even though my husband hates it? | Ok so I know this seems really dumb, but hear me out:

My husband (44M) and I (42F) have two children (13M and 15F). We recently watched the Netflix show ""The Witcher"" as a family, and enjoyed it a lot. Our kids especially loved it, and actually rewatched the show together immediately after we finished it. 

Since watching the show, the kids have been singing this song that the bard character sings on the show (""toss a coin to your Witcher"") over and over and over. It's kind of a meme in our house now, I guess. I personally thought it was funny, but my husband quickly got irritated by it. He asked them over and over to sing something else, because he was tired of hearing the same single line of a song a million times (they don't sing the whole song, they just sing ""toss a coin to your Witcher, oh valley of plenty, oh valley of plenty""). Finally, he told them that every time he heard them sing that song, he'd take a dollar out of their weekly allowance. 

I told him that I thought that was ridiculous, but he said that he thought our kids needed to learn to respect other people and not purposely do things when they knew other people found it frustrating. I don't think the kids were actually that upset about the allowance thing – they just thought their dad was a bit of a buzzkill. But I don't think our kids need to be taught that having fun and enjoying things are causes for punishment, just because their father is apparently easily annoyed. Also, I don't think he was genuine about wanting to teach them any sort of ""lesson"" – I think he just wanted them to shut up and thought lording their money over them was a good way to achieve that.  

So, I told him and the kids that I'd replace any allowance their father tries to take away from them. They've quickly resumed singing the song – with perhaps even more fervor than before. But my husband is very irritated with me for undermining him. I don't think that's fair of him though, since we always make decisions about punishments/allowance as a couple, and he made the original threat without consulting me.

I know this seems pretty low-stakes and silly, but I am genuinely questioning my stance on this, since my husband does have a point that we should teach the kids not to knowingly annoy people.

1,"AITA for cutting off my daughter's tuition because she took extra years for her degree? | My wife and I have always stressed the importance of school, and we were lucky enough to be able to put away a considerable amount of money towards out kids' education. The deal with our kids was that we would pay for four years of undergrad, and as much post-grad school that their tuition fund could cover, which is most of it. 

Our two oldest took advantage of this fully. My oldest (29M) had his undergrad paid for, and most of his medical school. Our middle (25M) is currently working on his PhD, also paid for. 

Our youngest (23F) has been more difficult. In her third year of undergrad she nearly flunked out due to mental health issues, and has since been at school part-time, and as a result she will be finishing her degree in 6.5 years instead of 4.  She is currently in the middle of her fifth year. 

Because of this extra time, her need to repeat courses, and the extensive amount of therapy she has needed, her undergraduate degree is costing us almost $25,000 more than her brothers. We have told her that because of this, we will be cutting her tuition off after this semester, and the rest of her funds will be available if she chooses to get her Masters degree or her PhD, just like her brothers. 

She says this is completely unfair, and that she will have to take loans out, but since she has a full-time job I don't think her loans will be extensive. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask a 23 year old to pay for her own school. I think this is fair, since we are honouring the agreement that has always stood, and the rest of the money will be available for her if she needs it. 

She hasn't spoken to us since, and texted us that she will be working over the holidays and therefore will not be able to come home for Christmas, which is breaking my wife's heart.

However, whenever she does come home for someone's birthday or Christmas, she always drops off a couple of lottery tickets as presents before she heads off on her way.

My brother scratched off one of his tickets, and got a match. He wasn't too excited because we have won a few times over the years, but only actually got $5 max. He asked me to go out and redeem it because he wasn't 18 yet, and I was initially reluctant because we live out of town and the closest lotto is 30 minutes away. I told him I would go if he gave me half of what he won, and he agreed.

I left to redeem the ticket, and I ended up winning $500, cash in hand. I was fucking stoked and rushed back home. When I told him and showed him the money, he was ecstatic. I handed $250, then he looked at me and said ""What the fuck."" I asked him what was wrong and he told me to hand over the rest. After I tried to explained to him that we made a deal, he started getting mad and throwing a little tantrum. I tried reminding him that I spent almost $200 getting him one of those authentic football jersey of his favourite player, Neymar, but he was having none of it.

I dodged her attempt and told her again that we made a deal, before she told me to give it. I yelled ""fuck this"" as I left and drove back to my college dorm a couple hours from home.

After I got to my dorm was getting texts from my mom, brother, and a couple cousins telling me to come back home, or just saying that I was acting like a dick. I ignored everyone, but when I got a text from my sister (who I haven't really talked to for almost a year) which said ""I heard you won some money from my ticket"", I just replied with ""lmao, fuck off"".

Now this toaster was an absolute disaster, it was filthy like it had not ever been cleaned, burnt bread crumbs were falling out everywhere and it looked like it had been used as a football in the backyard.

It was clearly user damage and therefore not covered under warranty for a refund or exchange.

I had enough and handed her the toaster and said I wouldn't be serving her with that attitude. She flipped it again, said a few choice words about me and then stormed to another area looking for a manager presumably. The next customer apologized for her which was really nice. 

I didn't think much more of it until I was called into the Store Manager's office and formally given a warning for poor customer service and treating customers not in the way the business expects.

The Store Manager obviously was contacted by the lady and made out as if she was the victim however my side of the story didn't seem to matter.

Now I have to attend a follow up meeting with the Store Manager to discuss what will happen to me. I could potentially be fired.

1,"AITA for refusing to pretend to buy my girlfriend drinks? | This is going to be ridiculous. Forgive me.

A few weeks ago my(31m) girlfriend(22f) of 8 months invited me to go bar hopping with two of her friends. They are also a couple so this was a double date. I don’t like her friends but I agreed to go to make her happy.

As she was putting on her makeup, she told me she had to ask a favor. She asked me to pretend to pay for her drinks in front of her friends. She said she would give me cash before we left to make it look like I am paying when she is actually paying for herself. 

From the beginning of our relationship we’ve agreed to keep our finances separate. We buy gifts for holidays and birthdays, but do not pay for each other for anything else. We pay separately when we go out to eat. If she asks me to pick up something just for her when I’m at the store, she gives me the exact change back. I like this arrangement as it proves to me she is not with me for my money. Obviously I would not be with her for her money as she is a poor college student. 

It’s come to my attention that her friends are much more shallow than she is. I was shocked by her asking me to pretend to pay for her. I asked her why. She said her friends tease her because I never pay for her. I said I’d think about it. I felt inadequate as a boyfriend when she said that to me. I started wondering if I should just pay for her. Then I realized that this is manipulative on her part even if unintentionally. I was not going to be guilted into paying for her, or be humiliated for not paying for her.

I told her no which ended up snowballing into a bad fight. She started to cry and said that her friend’s boyfriend (the one we were going drinking with) always spoils his girlfriend and it makes her feel bad I never do that for her. It made me feel like shit to hear that. We agreed that it was for the best to keep our money separate and now she wants to flip the script. I spoil her in other ways. I allow her to live with me rent free because I love her. I told her that I don’t care what her friends do in their relationships because the only thing that should matter is what works in OUR relationship. 

We went out for the night and I refused to play along. She ended up paying for both of our drinks for the night. When I’d go to ask for 2 checks she’d passive aggressively say it was “fine”. 

Things were a bit tense after that night, but a few days later things were back to normal. Or so I thought. We got into a small fight last night again about something unrelated. She brought up that situation again, saying I acted like a complete asshole that night. Now she is giving me the cold shoulder.

I did not think I was an asshole. I thought she is immature to want to make her friends think I’m her ATM. However I’m starting to wonder if I should’ve handled it differently because she is very upset.

She said that if the cheese was on the chips it would be included, but not on the side. I offered to pay for the plastic container (they charge like .15 for an empty container), and she wouldn’t take it.

I initially said I thought that was pretty ridiculous and didn’t want to purchase them, but she informed me that the food would be trashed and I felt bad. So I ended up paying $7.00 for some shitty nachos and spite eating them.

0,"AITA for not tipping and complaining about delivery drivers who refuse to come to my door? | I feel like an asshole already, but I thought I'd ask some other people just to be sure.

So, I recently got a promotion at work that has me working crazy hours from home after I get home from the office. It pays well and I'm single, so I'm digging it. I haven't had much time to cook though, so I've been ordering delivery a lot. This is our busy season, so I'm only going to be working 80-90hr weeks for the next 2 months or so, then I plan to get back to living like a normal person.

I live in a very small apartment complex with about 12 buildings and 4 apartments per building. The buildings are arranged in a circle, so if you drive around, you'll eventually find the building you're looking for. Here's where my dilemma comes into play. I use a few different delivery apps, and I have written very clear instructions in both my address settings and the extra delivery notes on how to find me. I'm in building 7, apartment 2. It's an incredibly easy building to find, again - my apartment complex is literally just a circle. There are no offshoot streets or alleys or anything. However, 9 times out of 10, the delivery driver goes to the wrong apartment and pounds on the door, then calls me to tell me they're at my door. I get that directions can be tricky, but this is where I start to get frustrated. Every single time this happens they don't believe me and I have to convince them to go outside to check the building number. When they see it's wrong, they tell me to come to them. I always say no, because I'm paying for the food to be delivered to my door, and I'm usually in my jammies. At this point they get irritated with me and sigh before asking directions to my building. I tell them it's just a big circle, and again, they don't believe me. One guy made me stay on the phone with him until he could find his car, drive to my building, and drop off my food.

I used to tip well for delivery on apps, but I'm honestly sick of this. I'm terrible with directions and I found my way here when I first moved in with no problem.

Okay, here goes. This pissed me off to no end but I think mostly because it was unexpected. I think if they'd just been honest there wouldn't have been a problem.

So I was planning on going home to see my family for a bit. My parents moved recently into a smaller place so no longer live in the family home, and there's nowhere for me to stay. My brother also recently moved and I had yet to see his new place, which he said was massive. He's got two kids so I assumed as much.

He offers to let me stay with him rather than getting a hotel. Obviously, money is money so I eagerly accepted his offer. He specifically said he had a spare bed. You can probably see where this is going bearing in mind the title of this post.

I get to his house, ask where I should dump my bag, and he shows me to the bed. The bed is actually an airbed, which is outside, in the back garden, inside a flimsy fucking tent. There is a single pillow and a sleeping bag.

I mean jesus. So I laughed, I thought it was a prank and felt completely played. Fair enough, I thought. Just another in a long and storied tale of brothers getting one over on each other. Not something we have done much in our family, but to be fair after the initial surprise I ended up thinking it was quite funny. I did try and sleep outside but found it kinda rough, so I ended up coming back inside in the middle of the night and sleeping on the sofa.

I should say that he left the backdoor unlocked for me so I could use the kitchen, the bathroom, etc.

Anyway. Next morning I wake up and he tells me I've got to go. As in, leave the house altogether. It's like 7am. Turns out his wife has completely freaked out because I'm sleeping on the sofa. It's a brand new sofa and people can't sleep on it?? As if that's a thing. I tell him to fuck off because I'm sleeping. He is not joking though and I realise this finally. And yes, I literally get my things together and go.

The next day my mother tells me my brother was seriously offended that I didn't sleep in the tent, talked about all the effort he'd put into it and how he'd been planning it for ages. Like, he wasn't joking before. He really seriously thought it was cool to offer a spare bed and show me to a tent.

I'm not the asshole for sleeping on the sofa, right? Do I owe my brother an apology?

So I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?

His logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. 

My logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions.

She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as I followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling me to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to me saying “BABE” implying she wanted me to follow her and get in the car but I just said “No, I’m not going with you” so she gave me the middle finger and took off. That last bit made me upset and I texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn’t some game where she runs away and I immediately go chasing after her. She said I looked miserable when I was on my phone and humiliated her because I couldn’t even hold a conversation. Today we talked about it more and she says that she’s incredibly hurt because it’s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around me. She says my excitement for her isn’t genuine and that I say all the right things but don’t mean them. She says she understands that I’m sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure I felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration we would start having those conversations about how she’s feeling. In response I said, “If it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we’ve really talked about it. I’d know that something this big is obviously a good thing but it affects you too as my girlfriend so I’d try to be aware of your feelings.”

1,"AITA for wanting to spend money against my wife's wishes, after she seized my cards? | My wife and I have been together for 10 years and married for two. We have a great relationship but recently we have been arguing about money a lot.

I'll keep the details vague, but I collect action figures and other gadgets as a hobby. They are expensive, but it is my only hobby. I don't spend a lot of money for anything else, i.e. I don't buy expensive clothes, rarely go out with friends etc. Occasional exceptions are games on Steam and books/comic books. 

Over the years I have spent a significant amount of money on my hobby. We are both employed, and I earn approximately £2800/month, while my wife earns around £1300/month. At no point my hobby has caused us any financial issue. We have no debts, we have >£10,000 in savings on our joint bank account, and we have been able to save money pretty consistently (most months).

My wife thinks that I've spent way too much over the years (I agree that in the past at times I have overdone it), and over the past few months she has tried to get me to limit the money I spend on my hobby.  We are in the process of buying new furniture for our house and she thinks we should save as much as possible.  This escalated in her being very controlling (in my opinion) about my expenses, and recently she has been checking regularly our bank statement and questioning me about every expense. I made a mistake, and over the past few months I spent money without telling her (e.g. approximately £200-400/month). My wife discovered this, and was not pleased, so last week she effectively seized my cards.

Her side is that she has a right to seize my card because clearly I cannot control my expenses and I'm not mature enough to have one. She wants to keep it until I demonstrate more maturity. She thinks that since the money we earn go into our joint account, it belongs to both of us, and she can effectively veto how I spend my money. To be fair on her, she does discuss her expenses with me (but I never say no to what she wants to buy).

My side is that I admit I made a mistake in hiding my expenses to her, but I should have a right to spend some of the money \*I\* earn on my hobby, as long as it doesn't affect our financial situation (i.e. if we are in no debt, and we're saving money, I think I should be allowed to spend, say, up to £200/month). I work hard to earn those money and I have no other hobbies. I don't think she has a right to seize my card since the money I spend has no major impact on her. Also, the money I spend on my hobby is not wasted, since my collection has a value.

I told her that I didn't mean it, which I didn't. 

I also told her that I dont know why she decided to tell me that all of a sudden after we've been together for a little over a year now.

1,"AITA for telling my sister that she shouldn’t pursue her “dream,” even though it’s unrealistic, when she did the same to me? | For context, I’m 30, and my sister is 26.

Back a while ago, when I was around 23/24, I really was not enjoying my chosen career. I felt like I was a terrible fit for the position and I was severely depressed. On the other hand, I’ve always enjoyed art, especially digital art, and I was tossing around the idea of going to art school. My parents were extremely non-supportive, telling me that I should stick to my chosen career path and that art school would be a poor choice. I talked to my sister about it, as well. She said that it was unrealistic, like my parents did. (Though, admittedly, she did tell me that I should do it if I really wanted to.) She suggested that I give my chosen career a choice for a little while longer, see how it felt, and then maybe try art school. I kept on trucking with my career and now I can say I’m very, very happy with my decision.

Fast forward to now. My sister has been doing her chosen career path, non-health field-related, for a few years. Recently, she came up to me and told me that she’s been feeling dissatisfied with her current position and wants to pursue her “dream” of going to medical school. She was talking about all her plans for getting ready for medical school, etc etc. I told her, just like the advice she gave me, that she should stick out her current position and that going to medical school was unrealistic with her age and her chosen field. I mean, after all, if I could stick out my current career, so can she. She got MAD, saying that she’s always been supportive of what I wanted and dreamed of. Clearly not the case, even if the advice she gave was a good!

Our parents are supportive of her plan, obviously because they think that medicine is more “prestigious” and “worthwhile” than art. My mother chastises me, saying that I should be more supportive of her, and I told her that I was being supportive, just as my sister has been supportive of me.

Background first. My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years. We have a 3&5 year old. We live an hour apart. I take care of the kids solo basically. He works 2 days a week stocking and generally brings me $30-$50 on a good week...but for many weeks now he hasn't given me anything. He recently quit cigarettes for vaping and it appears that vaping(and getting nug fronts) and the expensive gaming rig he built and has to pay off is draining the funds before he even gets his paycheck.

Now for the question. Yesterday he sent me a text  with a picture saying he brought me a PS4 for $120 and happy birthday. My birthday was in May and I never said anything about wanting a console (I had actually just spent several months saving up  for a gaming PC so in my very tiny amount of off time I could do something i enjoy, but I also homeschool so I rely heavily on the PC for schooling needs as well so that was worth it) and my response was ""I will never touch it.""
He got really upset and said that I'm always going on about wanting a PS4 (I've actually said I will never play a console again because pc is all I need) and that I switched up on him and he can never get it right.

At first the kids were just swimming in the shallow water but they slowly started drifting further and further which is usually fine except that they were not paying attention to how far they were drifting toward us(very annoying)

After about 30 minutes the mother came up to me and the other guy and asked if we could stop fishing since our casting area was now near her drifting kids.

I said no. I (as politely as I could stand) told her that we were here first and had been for a very long time and up until her family showed up we were staying in our own lane and others around us were as well.

These are very embarrassing and personally I want to be the only person seeing them. To clarify, there are dozens of these pictures and they are all very unflattering and embarrassing. 

Fast forward to now. Girlfriend does this thing where she loves to basically comb through my entire phone. I fucking hate when she does this but it's a lose-lose situation for me. If I resist then she has reason to believe I'm hiding something, and if I let her go through it I feel violated of my privacy and she could possibly find something she doesn't like (like another girl texting me). 

So here I am, sitting with her while she looks through my phone. She goes to my internet history, photo album, even checks some text messages sometimes.

I never go through her phone because I believe everyone should have some degree of privacy and I would argue that a person's phone these days contains the most private things.

We divorced, and I let my ex-wife take full custody and move into the neighboring state (I regret this now but lacked resources to fight). I visited when I could and when Jessica was old enough she would come to visit for her summer breaks.

Eventually I met my current wife, a wonderful woman who had no problems at all with Jessica visiting. We fell in love and we even had Jessica fly in to be the flower girl at our wedding. She was very happy for us and all was well.

My wife fell pregnant soon after and we realized that her due date would fall in July, right in the middle of Jessica’s usual visitation. We contacted my ex wife and explained that my wife would be due during the visit and we would not be able to care for Jessica, but she would be welcome to visit for Spring Break.

My ex exploded (we were fairly civil before this) and demanded that we make accommodations, like having my brother and his wife take in Jessica while my wife labored. I explained that labor wasn’t the only concern, because my wife would be dealing with hormones and learning to be a mom, and I would have to return to work quickly so it would be all on my wife.

When Jessica visited next, she asked me why she couldn’t visit before, and if I would send away her baby sister when I eventually have a second. I told her that we did the best we could.

The next year my ex wife told me that Jessica wanted to stay home to focus on her studies. She never came back for another summer, instead visiting briefly around the holidays, and not even every year. She has been much colder, and I think my ex has had a large role in that.

In my mind we were simply being realistic.

0,"AITA for asking a teacher to make changes to his recommendation letter? | TL;DRs after every block.

Hi, 17F, applying for college/scholarships specifically in computer science. There is one computer science teacher (40s-50sM) at my high school, and I've taken three of his classes across two years -- all As, the only 5 on the AP comp sci test from our school last year. I've also participated in/later held leadership positions in the coding and robotics teams he runs after school. Both of these teams have placed in competitions each year I've participated, after consistently taking last place in previous years. I also won two of the coding competitions individually and was the sole coder for robotics when we took first my junior year (last year).

TL;DR All of that to say, I think I'm competent in comp sci, and this teacher is in a unique position to vouch for that.

I asked him to please write me a letter of recommendation, and he said he was happy to. He did that for many members of our teams who were planning to go into computer science. I didn't opt out of being allowed to read recommendation letters before I attach them, and his is not really what I was looking for. In two pages, he references my ""beautiful smile"", boys in the class being ""no-doubt distracted by her beauty"" (??), me being an animal lover and me having a nice singing voice. He barely brushes on anything related to computer science or even my competence in general (I had the highest PSAT/SAT scores in our year too, which he knows), and includes a lot of irrelevant information. He references my appearance four separate times, and he only mentions the coding team as part of a story about me being happy to pet a dog that they brought after the competition -- making no mention of me winning the individual portion of the competition itself. It's not a mean letter at all, but I still think it hurts my chances if anything because it makes it seem like someone who's known me in a comp sci setting for years can't really speak to any abilities -- or even like I didn't earn my grades in his classes, which I know I did. In my mom's words, it makes me ""look like a bimbo"".

TL;DR: Letter did not reference any computer science competency. Includes a lot of frivolous information, unintentionally makes me look ditzy.

Anyway, he asked if the letter had made it to the system so I told him yes, and thank you, but that there were a few changes I'd like if that was alright. I explained what they were, and he got pretty offended and said he was doing me a favor, etc. I understand he didn't have to write me a letter at all, and I still appreciate the effort. I offered to rewrite it myself for him to submit so he doesn't have to put more time into it, but he declined. Am I the A for taking issue with a favor if the favor isn't actually helpful?

1,"AITA for not planning a bachelorette party as maid of honor? | Ughhhh.

I read this sub all the time but never thought I’d be posting here. I’m kind of worried I messed up but I want to make sure this isn’t just my anxiety talking. 

My childhood friend, let’s call her Becca, got engaged to her fiancé last summer and asked me to be her maid of honor. I was pretty surprised, since we’ve drifted apart quite a bit since we were kids, but I was happy for her and I accepted. I wouldn’t consider us best friends or anything, but we talk pretty frequently and see each other at least once or twice a month.

Becca’s wedding is this Saturday, and she texted me last week and asked what my plans were for the weekend before the wedding. I thought maybe she needed help with some last-minute wedding stuff, so I said I could stop by her apartment and help her.  

I could tell something was bothering her and she eventually started tearing up and said she was really disappointed that nobody had planned a bachelorette party for her. She said she thought we were really close and didn’t understand why it hadn’t occurred to me to ask if she wanted one.  

Maybe I’m just dumb but this is my first time being part of a wedding party and I honestly didn’t know I was supposed to plan a bachelorette, I thought the bride normally did it. I’ve only been to one bachelorette before, for my cousin, and she planned the whole thing herself. Also, none of the girls in the wedding party really know each other that well (the bridesmaids are her college bestie, her fiancé’s sister and a friend she met through work), so I’m not sure how it would even have happened tbh. 

At this point, it’s way too late to plan anything before the wedding. This is a really busy week at work, and I can’t ask for time off with this little notice. Friday night is the rehearsal dinner and obviously Saturday is the wedding day. I told Becca maybe we could go get drinks after she got back from her honeymoon to celebrate instead and she was like “I guess” and said it wouldn’t be the same. 

I do feel bad, but I also think she should have communicated her expectations to me. So give it to me straight, AITA?",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness
0,"AITA for vacuuming the entire house except my brothers room? | I live with my parents and older brother. My parents don’t really ask us to do chores because I just take it upon myself to do certain things around the house because that’s what an adult does imo. I vacuum,help keep common spaces clean, take out the trash and recycling, cook and clean the dishes etc. My brother pretty never does any chores. My parents don’t ask him because he gets mad about having to take time away from other things he wants to do. 

Anyways this morning I spilled some stuff in my room so I had to vacuum. I figured while I had it out I would just vacuum the rest of the house too. I skipped my brothers room. He was in there anyways playing video games I believe. 

He came out as I was putting the vacuum away and asked why I didn’t do his room as it needed to be vacuumed. I said I didn’t want to bother him but if he needed to vacuum I’d just leave it out and put it away after he was done. He was quiet for a few moments before he said he was hoping I could vacuum for him since I vacuumed Mom and dad’s room and everything. 

I asked if he was feeling okay, because if he was legitimately sick I would do his room. But he said he was feeling fine he just didn’t really like vacuuming. I said well too bad - keeping your room clean isn’t my problem. 

He ended up NOT vacuuming and asked my mom to do it. I was like really mom??? When I found out. She said it was just easier than getting him to do it himself. 

The only reason I feel bad is because my mom had to do it. I’m annoyed for her. But I guess if I had just done it, she wouldn’t have had to.... AITA?

0,"AITA for refusing to split the cost of a housekeeper with my boyfriend? | My (27F) partner (35M) and I both have pretty different standards of living. We have lived together for several years so this is nothing new to us. 

To put it plainly, he would probably sit on camp furniture, eat off of paper plates, and sleep on an air mattress if it weren’t for my presence. This doesn’t bother me. It’s the guy he is and I love him for it. 

I on the other hand like home making and making things “nice”. I have purchased all of our furniture and creature comforts. 

His tolerance threshold for mess is way, way higher than mine. I wouldn’t say he’s a slob but he doesn’t think to do some of the regular chores that need to get done: like vacuuming the baseboards, scrubbing the toilet and cleaning the base, washing the floor, and washing the sheets, cleaning the crumbs off the kitchen counter after you make a sandwich. I think these are pretty typical chores. On a more seasonal rotation I do deeper cleaning, like purging the pantry and deep cleaning the fridge, washing the windows and other textiles around the house, etc. 

Both of us have full time jobs, but he makes 4x what I make. He happens to have a lot of hobbies and spends 100% of the weekend doing just that. He doesn’t make time, or find time, to do household chores so they end up in my hands.

I have asked him several times to share responsibilities with me, but I usually get accused of nagging or he holds it over my head as a giant effort. I should also admit here that his efforts to clean don’t feel very sincere to me (ie: he will swipe the brush around the toilet bowl, but never lift the seat to wipe up the calcified urine build up, a critical task in cleaning the toilet IMO). 

If he doesn’t accuse me of nagging, it’s that “I don’t think my shit stinks”. Or, if I in any way point out the inequities in the time we spend looking after the house, I’m accused of keeping score. 

Today I finally brought up asking him to pay for a housekeeper to come once a month. He insisted it was only fair if we split it. I totally disagree. He makes 4x my salary, and I clean every week. The cost of a cleaner coming once a month would be $100 tops.

He totally thinks I’m TA  for asking for this. 

The alternative to him paying in order to share the responsibility I guess would be me asking him to do chores. Which would lead to a tally and ultimately more resentment, so I don’t see that as a viable option. 

I think he’s being immature and that I’m not asking for a lot. Part of living together is about respecting one another’s needs for living.  feel like I make a lot of accommodations for his needs of living: our entire second bedroom is occupied by his hobbies. We have a whole garage with no cars in it that he uses as a workshop for more hobbies.

1,"AITA for telling a girl that unfortunate incidents in her life were ""karma""? | So yesterday, I get a random message from a number saying ""Hey, how's life? :) if you even remember me haha"".

I don't recognize the number right away, but on my end there is a conversation to scroll up to from two years ago. Turns out she was someone I matched with on tinder, and chatted and exchanged numbers and made plans with - and she was in contact right up to literally the last minute of the day we had plans, she ghosted me literally as I was getting ready and showering after having come home from work. Not kidding, just a couple hours earlier she was responding and discussing plans.

So not only was I shocked she remembered me, but thought it was bold and ballsy that she messaged me after what she'd done. So I told her that, asked what happened to her. She claimed she didn't remember doing that and apologized at first, then said she ""made some bad choices and ended up in a bad relationship and finally realized her worth and got out"" and also mentioned that it was ""probably when her life was blowing up and her son's dad went to prison and a bunch of stuff"".

So I accepted it and forgave her at first, chatted a bit more - but then we realize that apparently when she contacted me, although she somehow still had me in her phone, she mistook and thought I was someone else she knew with the same name - which explained a lot.

So following that I jog her memory a bit as to who I actually am (I didn't mention tinder before) and bring up highlights of our conversation, once again reiterating what she did. This time she sounded a little less remorseful and apologetic though - ""yeah, sounds about right, I probably did the same thing to other people, life got crazy"".

Eventually I gave a little more detail to help pinpoint who I was until she finally remembered. To which she said ""yeah, so I might have come home then and not bothered cause I was gonna be moving soon"". That's it, no apology, just shamelessly using that as an excuse as if that's normal.

Sure, she doesn't know me and she's just one person and this incident wasn't something that affected me greatly in any way, but I was shocked with her complete sociopathic lack of compassion in her words, how she sees basically anyone she doesn't know as disposable and therefore okay to do that to kind of like the ""#wastehistime201x"" meme a while back. She didn't seem to even understand that what she did was shitty, just kept deflecting it with ""there are bigger things in life"" and ""it's weird to be upset about something so insignificant"". But no, it's not about not being over it, it's the apathetic attitude she has about it.

So, I told her that I guess if she does stuff like that on a regular basis, the stuff that happened to her that she mentioned is probably karma.

My partner, isn’t like this. She leaves dishes in the sink to soak and deal with them hours or a day later. She’ll put a used mug or plate in the sink to soak and take out a fresh one for a new coffee or snack. This leads to the sink filling up and stuff getting caked on cookware.

My wife and I moved into a new apartment about a year ago, and let a mutual friend move in with us (Well call him Kevin, since he's basically the Kevin from *that* Reddit thread).

 We were iffy about it at first, but felt bad for him. Kevin had a rough life at home, being used financially by his older sisters, and since he had nowhere else to go we let him move in with us. He had a decent job and he promised to be clean and respectful and pay his portion of the bills on time. 

Ill admit he always pays his dues on time. But since the day he moved in hes been nothing but an inconvenience. He's lazy, and a total slob. His bedroom and bathroom are a disaster, and he's always making messes in the living room and kitchen and leaving them for my wife and I to clean up. I'm gone up to 16 hours a day and my wife also works full time. We don't have time to clean up after him, and do our best to respectfuly remind him to clean up after himself. He typically responds by getting indignant and shitty, and will avoid talking to us for about a week or so. 

We recently found out my wife is pregnant. This means that either we need to find a bigger house, or Kevin needs to find a new place to live so we can eventually have the second bedroom for our kid.

I told my wife I plan to confront him tomorrow and tell him that he's struck out, that he's exhausted us both and he gets to be gone before our baby comes towards the end of the year.

I had to waste half a month's subscription, and then decided to no longer share with Ann. I got a new account and am sharing with only one other person now. Ann feels that she's entitled to share the account with me, because she is now paying a lot more for her own individual account than she was when it was the three of us sharing. She has my number blocked and refuses to speak to me, unless I let her share the account again, which of course I have an issue with considering her past behavior.

1,"AITA for getting upset over a false paternity test | My wife and I have been married for 10 years. We met in college, and she has been my best friend for almost 14 years now. She is beautiful, supportive, kind, classy, and all around amazing as a wife. 

We went through a really rough patch about a year ago, mostly due to issues on my end. However, she told me she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. She told me she would only keep it if I was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, I said I was fully committed, and we kept the baby.

As time went on, I became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was mine. I did the math and thought it was unlikely it was mine, on top of having a gut feeling. I was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, I could barely even hold him because I was so convinced he wasn't mine.

I told my wife I wanted a paternity test. She was upset but told me to get one if it would ease my mind. The test comes back two weeks later and it says I am not the father.

I'm absolutely livid. I had an out of body experience. I stormed into our house and just let loose. I felt like I couldn't stop myself, I was completely broken in that moment. I cried and screamed and asked her what I did to deserve this. I absolutely never laid a hand on her.

The whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. This made me even angrier for some reason, so I kicked her out right then and there. Told her to pack her bags and just get out.

She calls me the next day and tells me that I deserve to know that the baby is mine, and asks me to get a paternity test from another company. I figure I have nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help me in a divorce, so we get one at the company she suggested, and I sent a third to another company, just to be sure.

I get the results from one and they say I am the baby's father. I wait a few days and don't say anything, then get the second set of results, also confirming I'm the father. I feel like the weight of the world has just been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally be the dad I want to be.

I call my wife to give her the good news and she tells me she's not moving back in. She says she's disgusted with how I acted by asking for a paternity test and my reaction to the false one. She tells me I can come see my son, but she will be filing for divorce.

I don't think my reaction was over the top for a man who thought he was being lied to about one of the most important things. I never showed any sort of violence and I was so emotionally broken at that point. I know how it must have looked to her, knowing that I was the father, but I don't think she's seeing it from my perspective. I'm planning on discussing it with her later and trying to convince her to work on it with me when I go see my son.

0,"AITA for parking super close to my neighbor? | My apartment has covered parking for tenants so there's two spots separated by a line, then a couple metal poles then two more spots. Me and her have two of the spots right next to each other so there's just a line between us and we each have metal poles on the other side. She normally just pulls in and I normally back in so our driver doors wind up next to each other.

&#x200B;

When I first moved in she would knock on my door daily to say that I'd parked too close to the line and needed to move my van over. The first couple times this happened I tried to be a good neighbor and moved my van a few inches. Since it kept happening I started parking farther over until one night when I had parked with my mirror touching the metal pole on the outside of my spot and she still showed up to ask me to move over.

&#x200B;

I told her no.

&#x200B;

She threw a fit. She eventually explained that she was afraid of me banging up her car with my door when I was getting out and since I had already explained that my van couldn't move over any further she suggested that I just start parking down the street. I let her know that I have a right to my spot and that there is no way that I'm walking my two kids under three years old down the street just to make parking more convenient for her. She really didn't like that, but she stopped knocking on my door.

&#x200B;

She did stomp around extra loud for a couple weeks after that (she's my upstairs neighbor) and started parking just a couple inches from the line between us. These are not cramped spaces, parking that far over leaves her over two feet on the other side. And I know she's doing it on purpose because I've come home while she was parking and seen her backing out to get just a little bit closer to the line.

&#x200B;

This has been going on for a couple years now and I keep trying to be the bigger person. I still park as far over as I can; since both of our driver doors wind up in the middle me doing this is the only way either of us can get into our car. When I pass her on the stairs I smile and say hello, she usually just glares at me and doesn't say anything.

&#x200B;

Then today she actually went and parked up on the line so that I couldn't quite open my driver door and had to climb in from the passenger side. So, when I got home from picking up my kids after work and she was still up on the line I decided to pull straight in and put my door on the outside, next to the poles, and to leave myself a couple feet of extra room for once. I only left 4-6 inches of space between us so it's not even possible to reach her driver door, much less open it.

&#x200B;

Now the AITA part. I'm not big and my minivan is big so sliding over from the passenger seat is more annoying than difficult. But the neighbor is a bigger lady with a small car, I don't think she can physically move from the passenger side over. She's made things inconvenient for me for years but I made it so that she literally cannot use her car until I move mine.

He has no bills to speak of other than his car insurance and he doesn't pay rent anywhere, he just goes from place to place. He also gambles excessively. This is relevant IMO because I want it to be clear that I didn't screw over some broke old guy that needed help. 

He found out that all of his friends get SNAP / food stamps /whatever and he felt that he needed to also because he was ""entitled to it."" - He didn't have any living expenses so this halted his application process. He informed me that he would be saying that he pays me rent and lives in my house which he does not. I told him that I was not comfortable with this as it was fraud and also rent is taxable income so his scheme would be costing me money. He told me that if I didn't comply he would fill out and sign the forms for me.

Everyone at work messes with him but in a big brother way. Probably because they see him the same way as me but they still mess with him while I never do.

However, I think the way people interact with him has caused him to feel like he can treat me with disdain and indifference. I assumed it was just that the fact I was new and young. The thing is though all the other workers help each other out and at the end of the day I usually sweep up the pile that everyone sweeps from their areas. Some guys will help out and do it if I’m busy. Basically it’s not beneath them.

When Rachel fell pregnant she told everyone that they would be waiting until the baby was born to find out the gender, wich really didn't suit any of my family and especially not me as I would like to buy little bits and pieces for baby as the months go not suddenly find out and have to buy everything at once.


Knowing my sister who is extremely impatient in all matters , I knew she would end up getting a gender scan even if she didn't tell her husband Nick. 

So every day i would sent her a message asking if she knew yet and would drop the question in to conversation. 


She told our mom I was driving her insane with the constant asking but I think it's 1000% normal to be excited to know if you'll have a niece or nephew and to begin baby clothed shopping.

Anyway fast forward to Rachel being 17 weeks pregnant,  I sent her a text asking if she knew yet and lo and behold she text back saying yes she had a scan and it was a girl.

I was through the roof with excitement but then Rachel text me again to say that she wanted gender neutral gifts only.

She was extremely adamant about the gender neutral gifts so i did 80% neutral and jut got a few pink dresses and frilly pink sleep suits as they were gorgeous.

She tried to talk me round via text saying she was terrified and that she wanted peace and quiet for her c section and said although I don't mean to i talk alot in exiting situations. 

I found that incredibly insulting but dropped the issue as she wouldn't budge. 

And then comes the ultimate bombshell, 2 days later Nick calls to announce the arrival of my nephew,  not neice,  nephew. 

Rachel never got a gender scan, instead she told me it was a girl to stop me asking her every day.
And she lied about her due date so I wouldn't be on labour watch and turn up at the hospital. 

I've refused to see the baby because I am distraught my neice never existed, I demanded that she give the gifts back as they are for a baby girl but she said no and sent me a pic of the baby in a pink frilly sleep suit!

In the UK, we refer to High School as Secondary School. Same thing basically. I stayed at the same school for my Sixth Form (age 16-18).

I was bullied at this school. I was an anxious kid and unfortunately people were cruel. Teachers were apathetic. It was not a good time. I only began standing up for myself towards the end.

I now run a successful business and it's made more than two million this past year. It's definitely known in the regional papers near that school. Well the school asked me to come back and give a talk + Q&A and I agreed.

School just started back up last week so I came on the Friday. I was mainly speaking to the Year 11 (age 15 to 16) assembly. Had around 150 kids.

So I give my presentation on how I made my money and got my business running, and afterwards do a Q&A. I get some questions, but one question is what role I think school played in my success, I told them:

""Well, not much....I guess it motivated me to get out of this place. The kids were cruel and the teachers here, and I realize this will sound bad, but they're useless. I'm sure those of you getting bullied here will realize that...these teachers are useless, and I don't give a single one of them credit....only I am responsible for my success. My own sheer force of will resulted in my success""

There were only two teachers overseeing this assembly, but they looked embarrassed and awkward...another kid asked me about bullying, so I answered with my own experience and the mindset I believe he needs to cultivate:

""I was bullied by this one kid...noone did anything even after I asked for help. In the end....I had to play fire with fire. I came up with a nasty rumour about the kid...which worked. His mental health tanked and he had to move school...you have to see your enemies as enemies. They're not your friends and people like that don't truly mature. You have to destroy those who seek to destroy you. That's the mindset I took in the business world and look what it's done for me.""

I had some of the quieter and shy kids come to talk to me after my talk, and I saw my younger self in them. I offered them work placements at my business (which would do wonders for their CV/resume) but I also instilled my mentality in them.

Now obviously the headmaster confronted me after this, and he was the same one who was there when I was there, but I told him bluntly ""Your school is shit...you're always at the bottom of the rankings and in 14 years you haven't changed shit"". He flipped me off and told me to get out.

For some reason, I was considered the ""artist"" of the group because of the drawings in the back of my notebook. E also wanted to be an artist, but L and R said her drawings weren't as good as mine,  
I didn't think anything of it until my notebook, the one with all my drawings in it, went missing. I asked all my teachers if they had seen it, but they were all clueless. I was going to give up on searching for it until L told me I left in my desk in math class. A wave of relief splashed down on me. I knew that the drawings weren't good. But I still valued them as if they were priceless.

The next time I had math class, I searched my desk for my notebook, but I found nothing. It kind of broke my heart that my drawings were gone but I eventually accepted the fact that it was most likely gone forever. If only that was what actually happened. The next day, when I walked into school, E was showing off some drawings to R and L. I was happy for her until I realized that the drawings that she was showing off were mine!

I was so angry at all of them, but I was also hungry. So I grabbed a milk carton and tiny container of cereal, whilst still yelling at E. I was going to sit down and eat, but R walk right up to me and blacked my way. She began to yell at me. And I don't know why, but that was the last straw. I was done with this bullshit. I squeezed my milk and cereal with quite a lot of force. And surprisingly, the milk busted, and it got all over R's shoes. She got furious with me, I don't know why they were cheap shoes.

About a year ago, my husband's old college buddy (Chris) moved into two rooms in our house while I worked out of state (where we plan to permanently move) and my husband (Steve) continued working in PA. This seemed to work for us and Chris whose credit is quite poor.
From the start, Chris asked if he could split his rent into two payments a month. Naively, we thought we were helping him fix his financial situation and get back on track, however it became clear he was spending the remainder of his paycheck every two weeks on pretty frivolous items and it quickly felt to me like he saw us as his last priority in his budget. He also was ""mistakenly"" short a few months and hasn't paid us back yet.
In December after a lot of thought, Steve and I agree we should lease the house in PA out entirely to cover the mortgage once he finished his job and moved back permanently to the new city in March. Basically, Chris said he wanted to continue living in the house paying less than the mortgage (he refused to get a roommate either) and after a lot of back and forth we finally just said we couldn't do it and he has to leave in March when Steve does. Chris treated the whole thing as if we were being unfair to him and he has an entitled streak when it comes to people that make more money than him, as if we owe him because we have and he doesn't.
Now its January and Chris has been acting very standoffish and he's made big shows of slamming things around while packing and dragging furniture across the floor (guarantee the hardwood is damaged). He barely speaks to us and its really awkward (he also pulled some shit the day I had to show the house to potential renters). So far he's only paid half Jan rent and told my husband on Saturday that he's going to live with another friend this week rather than wait until March to move. He hasn't left yet but its obvious he plans to skip out before paying the second half of the rent.
If he isn't gone by today I plan to issue a fifteen day eviction notice and then get court help if he doesn't pay the remainder of what's owed. I'm angry he took advantage of my husband's kindness letting him split the rent and is being miserable because he didn't get his way.

We've been together for a decade and married for about four years. He knew that there was a strong likelihood that we would have to move after my degree program. Now that we're approaching that point, apparently I'm now restricted from going certain places because we have to be in a state that isn't too restrictive on guns, because that would be taking away his freedom. That leaves me with pretty much the deep South, the rustbelt, and a scattered array of other states where I'm probably not gonna be able to make a living. Most of the jobs that pay a living wage in my field are in big metro areas, VA, DC, and so on. Again, this was discussed. I also brought up the possibility of moving abroad, but apparently that made him super angry because he stormed off and accused me of being inconsiderate.

I love my guns too. Don't get me wrong. I don't particularly want to go where I can't have them, or am restricted from having certain things that I can have right now. It's not like I'm trying to move somewhere where we can't have them. The bottom line is, I have student loans to pay... and honestly, most of that went to keeping us afloat while he was in between jobs for a year (I found him the job he has now... I was going broke paying his half of the bills while going to school, and I couldn't take any more hours at work without failing because of my schedule), and that was on top of him need health insurance (I have the VA... I didn't need it. I'm basically having to pay for both of us to have insurance so he can even qualify for it). I would like to 
at least pay off those student loans so we don't have to spend our lives in poverty. I'm not asking him to do it. I'm not even asking for help. I'm asking to be able to get a job that allows me to do so. It would be one thing if he had a degree, or knew a trade, or something... Anything, really... But he doesn't. He hates his job, doesn't want to go to school. He has no aspirations to do anything at all that actually involves any more planning than what he's doing now. Am I the asshole for wanting a better life for both of us? And feeling like I should be able to go for that, since I'm pretty much the breadwinner here? 

I just feel like I've been extremely forgiving and honestly very flexible about this. I've asked him to find somewhere he would like to go. I've asked him for suggestions. I can only do so much. We can't live on 30k a year because guns. And that says a hell of a lot considering most of our collection belongs to me.",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness
0,"WIBTA if I wore an above knee length dress to thanksgiving with religious family | This year I am hosting thanksgiving because I just bought a house so it’ll be a housewarming party as well. Also it’ll be a chance for some of my extended family to meet my husband for the first time. The thing about my family is about half of my extended family are Muslim. And pretty devout. However I am atheist and so is my husband. After I stoped being Muslim when I was a teenager my family would always continue to push their beliefs on to me and force me to pretend I was still Muslim when we were around other Muslim friends and family to keep them comfortable and not offend them. I would usually go along with some of it and dress modestly and go to them to the mosque or non denominational churches and just keep my lack of belief quiet. Mostly because I was a kid and lived with my parents or when I was in college, still depended on their financial help. 

Now I’m 24 year old married woman. I have a career, my own home, everything is on my own now so I don’t want to keep pretending with them and making myself uncomfortable for the sake of their beliefs. Why is ok for them to be comfortable but not me? Why is ok for them to push their religion on me but I have to be quiet about not believing in anything? 

I feel like I should be able to wear whatever I want in my own home regardless of who is coming. I am still on loving and good terms with my family but they will get upset if I wear a dress that isn’t to my ankles. (We live in hot muggy Florida). If I wear it they’ll try and defer to my husband and tell him to control me and make me dress modestly and that would force him to back me up and might put him in a bad spot with my family. 

Anyways my husband said just to give in for the sake of respecting them and it’s only one day but I’m tired of it. It’s more personal for me to stand up to them and dress how I want. Plus it’s not like I’m going to be naked or wear booty shorts and a low cut shirt or see through clothes. It’s a normal above the knee length dress for fall time.

0,"AITA for setting boundaries with my boyfriend’s family? | I (27F) have been with my boyfriend Josh (29M) for 2.5 years. I spend ~3 nights/week at his place, and we’re planning for me to officially move in in the next 6 months. The crux of the problem is, he lives in an apartment that his parents bought for him and his younger brother. His brother, Sam, doesn’t live in the same city anymore, so Josh pays his parents slightly below-market rent for the entire place. Since deciding that I should move in, we’ve been trying to get Sam to pick up his stuff from back when they lived together.

The thing is, even though Josh pays rent for the apartment, his parents still see it as “their place,” and his mom in particular will come unannounced and stay for long periods. Most recently, she came to the US for 7 months, alternating between staying with Josh or Sam. There was no end date set when she arrived, and she only left because of immigration requirements. She doesn’t approve of me living with Josh, is cold and snarky to me, and is also quite picky about her living environment, so I stay over less when she visits. She also expects Josh to spend every free moment with her, so we rarely get alone time when she’s here.

As she was leaving at the end of the 7 months, she mentioned she was planning on being back right after New Years! I don’t think I did a great job of containing my shock, and honestly the knowledge that she’d be back so soon was my breaking point. That night, Josh and I had a long discussion about setting boundaries with his mother. I told Josh that her behavior is making me reconsider our relationship, especially as our relationship gets more serious (I shudder to imagine what she’d be like with future kids).

So Josh talked to his mom, and the phone call was apparently a shit show. The highlights are:
- Josh told his mom that, for future visits, she needs to give us set dates in advance. No more unannounced, indefinite stays. His mom responded that it’s her place and she can stay there when she likes. Josh then said that, if that’s the case, we’ll find a new place to move into together. His mom was also offended by this suggestion.
- His mom was angry that we asked Sam to pick up his stuff. In her opinion, they bought the apartment for Josh and Sam, so Sam has a rightful claim over part of it, and we can’t ask him to move his stuff or get rid of it if he refuses.
- She also expressed concern that, if Josh and I eventually marry, I’ll treat her poorly. She was offended at my reaction when she told us when she’d be back, and called me manipulative for saying I was reconsidering our relationship because of her.

I was having dinner with my college roommate and her family, who are from the same country as my boyfriend, and they think my boyfriend’s mom is not the asshole. Some even think I’m being an asshole and should be more receptive to her visits and make more of an effort to endear myself to her.

Context:  I'm in a friend group with a couple of people and one of them (I'll  call Cal) sometimes will stay up really late texting in the chat. I  don't do this because I like having a good sleep schedule.

So  I'm sitting at my computer watching youtube videos when I get a call  from Cal. I pick up the phone and I get an answer from somebody who  obviously isn't Cal because his voice is much deeper and threatening. He asks if I live with my grandma and I replied I don't and that I was  just staying with her at the time. He also said that I shouldn't text Cal at 3 in the morning and how would I like it if he texted my grandma that late. I realized that I probably shouldn't be giving out that kind  of information to a strange person who I've never met so I hung up on  them.

I got a text from Cal a little while later, he told me to take him off the group chat which was fine with me but also that it was disrespectful to hang up on him mid-conversation. I replied that I didn't have to talk with him and I don't want him calling me or my grandma. I also told him that it's not my fault he texts in the group chat that late and I've never texted in the chat that late, just him and my other friends.

My BF of five years (both roomies know him well) will spend the night once a week or once every other week– we spend the vast majority of our time together at his place because he lives alone. He accidentally left his toothbrush at my apartment last weekend, so I stuck it with my toothbrush in my side of the double-sided toothbrush holder that I share with the other girl. A few days went by before my roommate came knocking on my door to tell me that the fact that my BF's toothbrush was in our holder had been making her super uncomfortable for days and she needs me to move it. Her approach was super serious and tense and a bit awkward, but I could see where she was coming from and that I was inconsiderate for putting his toothbrush so close to hers. I jumped up, grabbed a spare holder from under the sink, stuck his toothbrush in there, and set it down right next to our holder. She was quiet for maybe 30 seconds before she came back to my room and said ""I'd just feel a lot more comfortable if you put his toothbrush away somewhere or if he just made sure to bring his own every time... it's not his bathroom and it's not his apartment."" She's 100% right– it's not his bathroom and it's not his apartment– but I don't think the presence of a stick of plastic that belongs to him asserts the truth of either of those things.

So, I work in a restaurant. I would like to think I’m a pretty hard worker who helps out everyone no matter the circumstances. I’ve been in management as well, so I understand how to deal with customers and coworkers alike.

Yesterday, I had a table of 5. The ladies were extremely nice, but they required a bit more attention than a typical table. I wasn’t worried about accommodating them since they were very pleasant despite their constant requests. Two of the ladies sent their food back because it wasn’t what they were expecting. When their new orders came out, a different server ran the food. Up until this point, I was the only server to touch the table. 

When I returned to check on them, they were pissed. They said the other server had an attitude and threw their food at them. I didn’t see anything, but I got the manager who then spoke to them. After speaking with her about it in the back, she came out laughing which angered my table even more. They were so pissed that they didn’t want to finish their food and that prompted them to demand to speak to the GM. She continued to laugh while all of this was happening. He comped all of their food and as a result, they didn’t leave me a tip. 

Obviously, that pissed me off because I wasn’t the one who antagonized them and I worked extremely hard to make sure they were taken care of. They told my GM that I did a great job and them still not tipping is a different issue. However, I’d like to think that they would have if things did not go awry. After they left, another server asked why was she laughing. Her words were, “I thought it was a funny situation.” She kept saying she didn’t care and didn’t say anything to me until she left. I spent the rest of the day silently seething. Now, I’m not really the type to hold grudges. After I told my manager why it pissed me off, I went home and let it go. However, the fact that I lost money because of it makes me not want to talk to her.

Today, I‘m doing my usual thing. I ran some of her food, bussed down a couple of her tables when I had time. I’m just not interested in talking to her until she apologizes to me. One of my coworkers asked why I haven’t said anything to her, and I remained silent about it. I don’t want to add more fuel by talking shit behind her back.

1,"AITA for throwing out my gf's jars | Throwaway because I know she likes to read relationship boards sometimes.

I(42m) moved in with my lovely gf(28f) a few months ago, before this craziness started, and we'd been dating for a year before that . She's an excellent cook and really funny, so life with her has been great but since this incident she's been snappy at me and lost some of her perkiness and good humor.

She always liked to mix ""fancy drinks"" in big Mason jars to drink around the house. Now mind you, I've actually been a bartender before, her drinks are not fancy. They're not even drinks. She usually just squeezes a lemon and puts some ice on her water, or she makes green tea and cools it in the fridge with mint or wtv. And the jars usually come from some grocery or the other, she saves jars from bulk peanut butter, bean jars, whatever has a big glass jar she's going to end up saving it to drink from it.

Before moving in I'd asked about the jars cuz I thought it really strange. I mean, she owns normal glasses. Her justification was that the jars are bigger and therefore she doesn't forget to drink water throughout the day. At the time, I kind of assumed this was some weight loss thing she didn't want to actually tell me because she was embarrassed, as she's a little bit chubby, so I let it go.

But now I've moved in, the jars were annoying me more and more. She doesn't keep every one of them, but she has like ten in their own shelf, and it seems like such a stupid waste of space in our small kitchen. Besides, we have glasses. She doesn't have to drink from a jar. So this earlier this week I was tidying up the kitchen while she slept in and I just... Threw them out.

I think the kitchen looks much better, we have more storage for pots and she can still prepare her ""fancy drinks"" in normal glasses. She was pissed. I never seen her so mad. Her main point were that the jars never bothered anyone and it's none of my business, but now I live here too so I think it is. During the fight, and this is where I may be the AH, I mentioned that it's stupid to want special recipients to just drink flavored water, it's not like it's a cocktail and she's only doing it to lose weight anyway. 

She went really quiet at that and walked away from me. I gave her time to get over it but it's been a few days and she's still moping around, and I noticed she doesn't seem excited about her ""fancy"" drinks... That's making me feel kind of bad, but I still think I was in the right to throw out her jars, as they were just garbage.

I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.

The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.

Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

She has a daughter who I love a lot. And I basically helped raise her since I was 11. But I can’t be a “mom” anymore. My older sister just expects me to take care of her daughter and do every little thing for her. She’s taken advantage of me for so long. And I let her. She’s put me down a lot. For not wearing makeup. For being ten pounds heavier than she is. For not doing enough for her. For not making her food when she wants. For never being enough. For having feelings.

She was not calm and yelled at me at one point and didn’t let me finish what I was saying. That was the point when I got up and went to my room. 

I did stop talking to her at one point in my life to an extent, but decided to give her another chance to see if she would maybe listen to what I have to say or if she could try and understand that it’s never been easy being her sister.

I'm fully aware of what I need in order to get employed but theres only so much I can get without her being involved. But every time I mention needing to get/prioritize these things, she gets angry and tells me to stop trying to ""start a fight"" and blames me for getting upset about that. And if that doesn't work she comes up with another excuse as to why me getting the paperwork I need and a job isn't a ""priority"". She uses excuses like we need to use the little money we have in order to buy new clothes instead of using it on transportation or ordering my stuff.

0,"AITA For refusing to let my Uncle and Aunt borrow my car during their visit? | My Uncle and Aunt visited me in the US last week, and now I'm being branded by them as a selfish asshole. I (25 Male) am a big car guy and as a result, both the vehicles I own are expensive performance cars ( '17 C63 AMG S and '18 Ghibli SQ4 for you car junkies out there) . As a result, I never let anyone who isn't directly under my insurance drive them ( Only my parents and GF ever drive them). In addition, I have around a total of 25k in modifications done to the cars, so I stand to lose that money in the unfortunate event that either car were to be damaged or totaled. Basically, they ended up coming for a short 2 week trip. They decided to use my house as a hub and travel around, which I didn't mind at all. When we discussed their plans for the 2 weeks, it became apparent that they would do a lot of long distance driving ( \~2000 miles total) . I made sure they were aware that I would not be willing to let them use either car for their trip as they have had a history of not respecting other people's cars ( They filled regular gas in my dad's car before when it requires premium and brushed it off like it was no big deal). Things seemed fine and they booked a rental car, which I got them a huge discount on ( Worked out to an average of 32 bucks a day for a Small SUV) . They are not poor by any means btw, together making around 200k. The trip seemed fine, until after they returned home. My parents told me that apparently they were upset and have been bitching about me being a selfish asshole for forcing them to rent a car despite having two cars. I have an extended family of about 45 people and apparently a good chunk of them have had an earful about this 'act of selfishness' on my part. My aunt and uncle even went as far as to say that I should have considered family members needing to borrow my car before buying such an expensive car. Unfortunately, while my Mom isn't siding with them, she is upset at me for not letting them borrow one of my cars. She says its not a big deal and that nothing would have happened, and even if something would have happened, I could just ' claim insurance'. My dad, however, understands my point of view and says theres nothing selfish about what I have done. I'm so conflicted. Have any of you been in a similar situation?

Today during my work (I work alone in the Café) a family of 15 people came inside the cafe (4 adults and 11 children) and only ordered 1 coffee that's it. The kids were playing around, crying, making noises and leave garbages everywhere. They were all eating stuff from the outside, and drinking some stuff they bought at the grocery store. They all went to the washroom, everyone no exception. I had to put 2 new paper roll in the bathroom be wise they were taking so much of it. I had to replenish the big water contenant 2 Times because they were taking so much from it. After 20 minutes I was a little on nerve and one of the kid was touching the water contenant and dropped it on the floor. After that, the mom just went to me and ask for more water in their bottles (bought outside of our coffee shop) without apologies for the water on the floor. 

At this point I was angry and told her that I was not going to give her free water anymore. She started to say that we have really bad customer services and that she was always well served in other restaurants. I told her that we are not a restaurant but a self service coffee shop and that the way the whole family was acting since their arrival was really unrespectful. After that she claimed that she had the right to have free water and I told her no. She quit the coffee with all her family saying that they will all tell this to my superior.

I originally agreed but soon discovered it would just be too much for me and tried to help him find other options, he would not take no for an answer and was constantly begged.

I talk about cooking a lot with one coworker and almost everytime I do one guy, John butts in that I should get an instant pot. And everytime I tell him I can't afford one right now and I like the stuff I have (crockpot, nice pots and pans set, grill) this has been going on since around Easter. 

So yesterday I'm talking to the other coworker trying to figure out how to do a pressure cooker recipe in a slow cooker and John says I wouldn't have this problem if I had an instantpot. I get fed up and turn around and say:

""Oh thank you so much for offering to buy me one! Especially since I've mentioned several time times that I CANT AFFORD IT. That's so sweet of you! Now don't get me anything too fancy.""

He looked at me like I poisoned his coffee and then looked at my boss that was in earshot who just asked him what he expected. 

John then said I didn't have to be a bitch about it and our boss said he could either shut up or go home unpaid.

0,"AITA for not wanting to let my roommate's friends (who are poor and are visiting here at great expense from the other side of the country to visit my roommate) live at our place for free for 2 weeks? | Short version/question: If you live in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate, and one roommate has a friend visiting from out of town/a different state, how many days is it socially acceptable for said visitor to crash there before they have to leave? 

Long version/Context:

My roommate and I are friends and we get along great on almost everything else, but we vehemently disagree over this one issue. We're both in our early 30's and live in a small-ish but expensive 2 bedroom apartment in San Diego with a small common area. My roommate is originally from the East Coast and last December she told me she was having a friend from back home flying over here that would be staying over ""for Christmas.""

I didn't initially see a problem with this because I figured that if you say someone is coming over ""for Christmas"" meant that they would be here maybe 4 or 5 days. 

Well, as it turns out, my roommate's friend ended up staying and crashing at our place for 14 days, from December 15th until the 28th. This pissed me off, especially considering that I did not care for this friend at all and was mad about having a third person (whom I found annoying) staying at our home for free taking up our relatively small space for half a month.

After the friend finally left my roommate and I ended up arguing a bit and having a discussion about it, with me telling her that I thought it was absolutely egregious to have a guest over for that many days. In return she told me that in her experience if a guest was travelling across the country, it was totally normal to have said guest stay at your place for 12+ days, it happened all the time within her friend group, and she thought I was being an asshole for objecting to it. 

We've mostly worked past it and talked it through, but now ten months later she wants to have another friend from the east coast over and have her stay here and crash at our place for 12 days. She says she has earned it and compromised with me by not having anyone stay over here for that long over the last 10 months, but I still think its an egregious amount of time and you can't have a guest over for that long when you live with someone who is not friends with said guest. 

We've talked about it and realized that in large part it may be a class issue: me and my friends are from southern California and mostly grew up wealthy for the most part, which explains why we were not comfortable staying with people for very long and could make shorter across-the-country trips, while her and her friends grew up with almost no money at all and for them trips to San Diego were once in a lifetime experiences and its normal and polite to host them for two weeks or more.

0,"AITA: For not spending time with/getting to know my(16F) soon-to-be stepfather(50Ish?) who just moved in that I met 2 months ago | So, my parents got divorced when I was 13, they split up without any issue and I am close to both my mother and my father and they live about 20 minutes from each other and I can go to either one as I please pretty much.

Now in comes John, the guy my mom is dating. She met John about 1 year and 5 months ago and they have been dating ever since, I knew about this but I had never met John as I think my mom did not want me to meet him until she was certain there was a future and all of that.

Now this finally changed about 2 months ago, she brought John home and had him meet me. Now John seems like a friendly guy, I have no issue with him and I figured I'd have to be nice and accepting and all of that not to make my mom look bad so well that is what I did, I spend some time with him, asked him about his life and all of that so the first meeting went just fine.

After this I met John a few more times, he invited my mom to have lunch with him and asked if I wanted to come along that sort of stuff and I did not want to be rude so accepted. Now things like this kept happening over a 1 month period where John would invite me along, I would try to be nice and all of that.

Then about a month ago my mom came to my room to talk to me and asked me if I liked John, I said he seems nice. She said she is very happy we are getting along so well because John asked her to marry him and will be moving in with us. Now I sort of shut down at this point, like having a guy I barely know move in? I know this would have happened eventually but it seems like it makes sense to first you know, create a relationship before forcing me to live with this guy? But regardless I figured him moving in would be after the marriage and there would be a lot of time to get to know the guy, nope, he moved in the next day.

Ever since he moved in I have been avoiding him, I am not rude or anything like that but to me he is a stranger living in my home and it makes me feel really on edge. My mom keeps trying to get me to spend time with John asking me to watch a movie with her and then inviting John as well and my mom leaving the room because she ""Had to get some more groceries"" that sort of stuff. Also John started to try and ""Parent"" me telling me to tidy up my room and shit like that, now my room is tidy, I am not 10 and he is not my parent so I told him to sod off in a nice way

After a month of this I told my mom I am going to be moving in with my dad and well she started crying and asked me why and I figured it was best to just be honest and told her because a stranger was living in the house. She got mad at me and said she thought I like John to which I replied by saying I hardly know John and she said that is because I make no effort to get to know him.

0,"AITA for telling my roommate’s little sister to not squeeze my biceps? | I (18M) live in a dorm room with my roommate (18M). His mom and sister (14F) come to visit nearly every other weekend. His mom treats me out almost every time too. They’re great people. The thing is, I think his sister has a little crush on me. She’s very interested in my life and always tells me every little detail about her life. She laughs even when I don’t say anything particularly funny. My roommate says she doesn’t usually act this way around other people. I’m not leading her on or anything. I’m not a touchy-feely person to minors, though she kind of is one to me. She sometimes gets close to me and I use non-verbal maneuvers to keep an appropriate boundary. 


Yesterday, his mom and his sister came over again. I have been working out pretty hard lately and his sister must have noticed. I’m probably quite jacked to high school girls only. After we sat down at the restaurant and his mom went to the bathroom, his sister extended her arm across the table and squeezed my left bicep, saying “what’s up Mr. Hard Muscles?” in a flirtatious tone. That freaked me out a little and I told her quite loudly to not do that again. She apologized. My roommate asked me what the big deal was. I said that I didn’t like other people touching my body that way without my consent. My roommate asked me if I was a girl because I was acting like one. I said that some guys don’t like that, especially coming from a little girl. We noticed his mother walking back so we dropped the conversation. His sister didn’t talk to me much. 


Later last night, my roommate said that I was a dick to his sister and I shouldn’t have told her off and hurt her feelings. He said that she asked about me all the time during winter break and really looked up to me. I told him that was great, but she really needs to learn to not squeeze any body part of anyone else without the other party’s consent. He told me to stop being such a wuss. I told him to be careful and don’t go around squeezing women’s boobs. He said that was such a dumb statement because playfully squeezing someone’s biceps and squeezing someone’s boobs are on totally different levels. I told him to not playfully squeeze women’s biceps either without their consent because that might not end well. He told me that most women are not even as protective over their bodies as I am over mine. I told him I’m stopping this stupid conversation and walked out. I went out to the dorm lounge and ragged about my roommate’s dumb views. The two guys there said I was the douche for telling a little girl off for playfully squeezing my biceps.

""Peanut butter.""

And here's where I come in. I laughed a little and said ""You were afraid of eating peanut butter? Like what, it would get stuck in your mouth and you wouldn't be able to talk?"" I laughed a little more. A few other people chuckled lightly. 

The first admin looked shocked and embarrassed, and said ""No, that's not what fear food means. Um. Nevermind."" She got up and left from the group, and for the rest of the day she worked alone in the other side of the office.

The second admin was glaring daggers at me and told me I was an asshole and should have kept my mouth shut. I countered it with saying I've never heard of people being \*afraid\* of eating peanut butter. She said that it was part of the admin's eating disorder, and that I should pick up a book, or just stick to not talking in group settings like usual.

1,"AITA for giving my twin sons different allowances? | I (43M) have four kids. The two oldest are twin boys (both 14M) and then we have two girls (10F and 7F). All of them are pretty responsible kids, and consistently do their chores as they're meant to. We have a little chart that says what all their jobs are, with each of their roles being proportional to their ages. The boys take on the largest number of responsibilities, which each of them alternating jobs every week. 

Officially, their allowances have been as follows for a while:

Boys: both $15 a week

10-year-old: $10

7-year-old: $2, mostly for symbolic purposes lol

Obviously, as the girls age, they'll start making more money, just as they'll start doing more work around the house.

But here's the thing. One of my boys (call him A to differentiate) is a real leader in the home. He's just naturally brilliant with people, is constantly dealing with conflicts between his sisters and his brother, takes charge in rough situations, and is really considerate of others. He's always been the ""frontman"" between his brother and him, with him speaking for both of them while his brother hangs back. Though we've never told him to, and though it's not his responsibility, he's always been a real help to his mother and me in keeping the house running smoothly. His brother (call him B), on the other hand, is much more reserved. He keeps to himself. That's not a problem, but we do recognize that A takes on more ""emotional labor"" in the household than B. 

So, my wife and I have been giving A an extra $5 a week for the past year, so he's been making $20 while B's been making $15. We think that's fair, since A's taken on more responsibilities in the house, even if they weren't responsibilities we told him to take on. The boys both have debit cards (got them when they were 13), so we put the money directly into their accounts and neither of them see money getting exchanged. A does know he makes more money, though.

Last week, however, B found out his brother was making more money than him. They were online shopping for video games, and B questioned why A was able to afford stuff he couldn't (A hasn't really spent his extra money, so it's accumulated a fair bit). A admitted to him that he's been making more.

B is absolutely furious with us. He says that it's totally unfair that they've been doing the same amount of chores, but A's been making more money. But we don't really know how to explain to him that A deserves recognition for the less easily quantifiable work he does in our family.

The drive thru has two separate lanes to order from. Usually there are two separate lines of cars feeding into the two ordering stations. Today there was a ~5 car line feeding into the left lane and only one car waiting in the right lane behind the person ordering. I thought it was odd that the lanes were so uneven, but noticed most of the cars were big pickup trucks and thought maybe they couldn’t fit in the right lane of the drive thru (I realize that sounds stupid now but it literally made no sense to me why everyone was waiting in one long line for no reason when they could get in a shorter one). Anyways, I got into the right lane as it was clearly shorter. I’m waiting in the lane and as I roll down my window to place my order, a man gets out of his truck, walks right up to my window, and starts yelling at me. I was honestly shocked as I didn’t see him approach and was confused at first. He said “I knew what I was doing”, “that I was cutting people” then he called me a “fucking bitch”. I am a skinny girl and this was a big guy in a big pickup truck.

Anyways I was flustered and looked back at the cars and saw that they were all lining up in the left lane and then moving into the right lane as the ordering station cleared.

0,"AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for waking me up? | So my boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years and living with each other for about 1.5 years. We both work full time and do a bunch of extra curricular activities together. I love him to pieces and we have gotten along pretty well.

So to start off, I have always been a night owl. I just don't function well in the morning and prefer to stay up late. Before I used to have to take sleeping aids or smoke some weed to help me sleep early if I needed to work or go to school early the next day. Recently I got a promotion at my work that gives me a flexible schedule where I can work mostly at home. So I usually work later in the day since that's when I am most active. So now my sleep schedule is 4am-12pm. I've been much happier with this schedule and have been avoiding sleeping aids because of it.  

Now that info is out of the way, my boyfriend is has been doing these annoying things to get me to wake up earlier (like 9-10am when I went to bed at 4am). He'll tickle me, put his cold hands on my body, throw the dogs on my bed, whatever little annoyances he can do to wake me up.  I've been kind of brushing it under the rug until today. I told him if I did the same to him he wouldn't appreciate it, so I don't know why he things it's okay to do it to me. His reasoning is that I don't have a healthy sleep schedule and it's out of concern for my well being. I asked his what a healthy sleep schedule is, and he responded ""sleeping when the sun goes down and waking up when the sun comes up"". I then told him that I would have to see some research on that, because different people can have different sleep schedules and can still be healthy as long as they are sleeping the right amount of hours. Then he got kind of offended and said that he won't offer any critique of me anymore. Now he's not talking to me. Idk if I am being an asshole here, but I feel like I am justified in confronting him about it. 

Side note: I still get up early (7am) to let out our dogs and feed them so he can sleep. I didn't bring that up to him.",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness

We’re not homophobic but my mom felt even more betrayed and like he had been lying to us about who he was all this time. My dad tried to play the victim card claiming how hard it was to keep it a secret that he was gay and that he didn’t want to destroy our family which is why he did it behind our backs. I think everything he is saying is bullshit tbh. Yes coming out is hard but we deserved to know and my mom shouldn’t have been betrayed like this. I also find the age gap really repulsive.

0,"AITA for backing out of getting an apartment with roomate and then renting it alone | This has been gnawing at me for a while. Last semester I (20F) was looking for an off-campus apartment with my friend (20F). I am a relatively low-maintenance person and she is a bit more Type-A, so she took the reins in apartment hunting. We looked for places for the two of us; albeit it was mostly her calling landlords and making appointments to check out the listings.

So, she finds a place, sets up a time, and I meet her and the landlord there. The place is walking distance to campus, has two beds and baths, is a good price (with utilities included) and the landlord is lovely. The immediate issue is that one of the bedrooms and bathrooms are SIGNIFICANTLY bigger than the other. The larger has a queen bed, an attached office, and a bath with a tub. It also had more privacy as it was in the back section of the house. The other was right off the living room and had a double bed and a shower. Within our friendship, she was the dominant personality and her immediate assertion is that she would get the bigger room. Initially, I was alright with this, but I told her that we would have to renegotiate the way we split the rent. She said that she couldn’t pay anymore, so I offered to pay more to have the larger room. However, this didn’t work for her either.

We discuss the situation for a while and don't come to a resolution. I remember that the landlady said she had a studio apartment in the same house. Because of the issues we were having and a whole bunch of other problems, I text her and tell her that I don’t think that living together is going to work out. I say it has nothing to do with our friendship, I just don’t think the environment would work for both of us. I finish the message by saying that I am going to message the landlady about renting the studio.

She calls me about five minutes later, says she was the one who searched for apartments and put in the work, she said no to living with other people, and she sacrificed a lot for me. I said I was sorry, I had no idea she gave up other opportunities for living situations, but I wanted to get out of the situation before we were miserable and living together. She said that she would also message the landlady to get the studio, so it was up to whoever could sign the lease faster. The conversation only escalated from there. At that point, I texted her and said that she could sign the lease and that our friendship was over.

Three weeks later, I finalize my internship in the town I attend college in. I have to find somewhere to live for the summer so, I text the landlady to see if she has any apartments available on any of her properties. Sure enough, my friend had not signed the lease and the studio was still up for grabs. So, I signed the lease as soon as possible.

0,"AITA for being angry about not going on holiday? | I feel deceived and sad.

I've(27F) been with my fiance(31M) for 5 years. We didn't go on any sort of trip during all those years - mainly because I've been stuck at university the first few years we've been together and then when I started working I didn't get any holiday or vacation leave simply because I needed money, I've been saving money to buy a flat. Fast forward few years, I have a flat, I have a car and we're living very comfortably. It's also the first time I got my vacation leave at work so we planned on going somewhere abroad. 

And there's the problem - we're not going anywhere. 

He has a younger sister, she's 28 and totally incapable of taking care of herself. She didn't go to university, doesn't want to work, she's still supported by their mother. Mind you, she lives a very prestigious lifestyle so often it comes to a situation when she doesn't have money for essential things like rent or bills. When she doesn't have money and her mother can't give her more, she asks my fiance. We argued a lot about it, because often he'll give her money and then he can't buy something for himself. After our last argument he agreed to stop all financial support until she gives back the money she already owes. It is about 2000$ at this moment, it may be more maybe I wasn't informed. 

He lied. He gave her money again and only admitted it after I confronted him about her recent calls. I knew it would happen, we talked about it a lot before - she's going to Brazil and has a hard time financing it, her mother wouldn't give her the whole sum. And she asked him again, lying she needs money for rent. Long story short we argued a lot about it, I was really angry he lied to me. When I cooled down after a week or so, the topic of our trip came up... And well, then it hit him that he can't afford it anymore because of current expenses. Basically he gave her money that he saved for holiday.

Am I really in the wrong here though? I just wanted to have something nice after years of working my ass off. Is it really this much, going somewhere nice for once? I feel like it is, now he makes me feel bad and says I'm spoiled because I've been pampered my whole life.

1,"AITA for being angry at my boyfriend for claiming to be Italian? | My boyfriend claims he's Italian. He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.

His mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised ""the Italian way"", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. 

As things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.

But it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like ""I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian"". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.

Just because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?

We’ve only been living here for several months, but Mike brought over a serious roach infestation from his previous apartment. The infestation has gotten so bad that none of us really go to the kitchen anymore except to use the microwave. 

I recently got a part time job, and spent my first paycheck on a pretty nice double door mini fridge to put in my bedroom so that I didn’t have to go to the kitchen as often and so I could have my own private area for food items. (Mike is known to get into food and  destroy it somehow.) To be clear,  I paid for the mini fridge with my own money, and my dad doesn’t buy me food, so all of the food I have in my fridge is bought by me.

My dad asked me if he could put something in my fridge a few weeks ago. I think it was just some cheese for his dog, since the dog wouldn’t eat his medication without it being covered in cheese. At first, I thought it was just a one time thing that’s no big deal. But it is a mini fridge. Its not big enough to hold a lot of things. So now with his occasional leftovers, food, or drinks now that he puts in my fridge on his own I don’t have enough room for my own things. And now he’s starting to come into my room when I’m not home to put things in and take things out of my fridge without my permission.

Now I’m very uncomfortable with him coming in and out of my room without my permission and using my fridge. I’m a very private person, I always keep my bedroom door closed, and I usually don’t have people in my room unless my boyfriend is staying the night. 

I understand that he doesn’t want to use the fridge in the kitchen because of the roach infestation, but in my opinion, if he doesn’t like it that much, he should hire an exterminator, or buy his own personal refrigerator. I’ve asked him multiple times to get an exterminator so that I can actually use the kitchen downstairs to cook, or at least so I can be comfortable staying more than a few minutes in there. But he keeps giving excuses (Ex: “I’ll call tomorrow”, “I’m too tired to call”, “I don’t have enough money”, “Mike should be the one to call,” etc.) If the kitchen was clean and roach free, I wouldn’t even have a mini fridge right now.

I offered to make dinner for a few nights for my parents. They agreed. I didn’t make anything for my sister because she just likes to do her own cooking. 

Meat is one of the things hard to get at the grocery store right now. I had heard a tip about using half lentils and half beef in any recipe using ground beef for health purposes and I thought it would save some of the beef. Yesterday I made a bolognese with half a pack of ground beef and lentils. Today I made chilli with half beef and half lentils. 

My sister noticed me adding the lentils to our Chili tonight and got angry with me for using her lentils. I told her why I was using some lentils - to save beef. She told me I was selfish for taking her food away from her without asking. Okay - I probably should’ve asked, I admitted that, but she overreacted in my opinion. She still had plenty of lentils left in the package and I don’t think people are buying lentils as much as beef. 

She told me to go to the grocery store and see for myself how bare all the shelves were. She said dry lentils were gone? She said from now on she was labeling and hiding all her food so I couldn’t take it.

So my partner and I have majority custody of my step daughter. Her father sees her a few nights a week and usually has her over night. Cool, she loves him and we want to support her having a good connection with her dad.

A while ago he began a second job at night. He gets paid cash and doesnt declare it. Because of this new job he now has less time to spend with his daughter. A few months ago he majorly cut back on his declared day job and upped the cash in hand stuff.  He sees his daughter even less, his declared income dropped a tonne. This drop has lowered his child support substantially. We are a single income family of 5 (3 kiddos). He now has a new house, new car. He claims he is doing this for his daughters benefit. (She will get the house etc) however he just got back from a 5 week vacation without her. We had her the whole time.

My hub has one of those habits where he puts his lips together really tight but instead of whistling he squeaks, like a mouse or a door that is in serious need of oiling.  He goes through phases where he does it a lot....like several times an hour.  Sometimes he'll squeak at me to get my attention.  Sometimes he'll squeak at me to wake me up.  Sometimes he'll squeak for no apparent reason, what-so-ever.  

Many years ago I asked him to stop squeaking to awake me.  He still does this about once a month to wake me.  I get mad at him.  He laughs.

A few weeks ago I let him know that after 25 years of being squeaked at, I can't take it anymore and can he please stop.  He hasn't stopped.

Note on hub: he is the biggest contrarian I have ever met (and I'm full-on Irish) and it's his history to NOT stop when someone asks him to do so.  He thinks he's funny and cute if he continues.  He's like this with friends and family.

I am actually very patient but I really can't take anymore.  (Remember the movie Chicago?)  And I'm becoming more adamant and aggressive about my requests and now I'm starting to feel like, well, an a-hole, but if he were to ask me to stop a habit for him, I would.

She met her husband (25M) in 11th grade, they watched some documentaries together and BAM - they've been annoying vegans ever since. They've calmed down a lot recently, though, which is nice, but man, those high school days were rough. Anyway, the three of us all live with my parents due to financial reasons and since my parents won't let any of us pay rent we do all the cooking/cleaning.

Now, as for me, I (23F) will NEVER be vegan because my favorite food is fried chicken. Ever since I was little, I would always ask my mom to make fried chicken. I know how to butcher and fry my own chicken from scratch, and it's a weekly ritual for me. On fried chicken nights, I'll usually have my sister make the sides so she can make them vegan and still eat with us. The problem is, she always moans about how watching me butcher and fry the chicken makes her sick and she's even tried getting me to do the butchering another room while she's in the kitchen, which is never gonna happen because that's both unreasonable and unsanitary.

Well, here's where the story turns - my sister is pregnant, and now she's been craving fried chicken. She literally eats KFC behind her husband's back. She even bought a mini-fridge to put in the garage behind the spare fridge where she hides entire buckets and eats out of them throughout the course of a few days while her husband is away at work (he's a trucker).

Needless to say, I find this hilarious. I keep telling her that she just needs to tell her husband and he'll understand (I know him really well, I don't think he'd freak out if she just explained it due to cravings) but she refuses because she's the one who made him go vegan in the first place and she doesn't want to be a ""hypocrite"".

Now here's the story - last week I'm frying up my chicken, and BIL is out on the road. My sister is behind me making the usual sides, and I notice she's staring at my chicken. As everything starts getting plated, she asked if she can just have a drumstick. Um, no. The drumsticks are MINE, everyone in the family knows this. She then asks if she can have a thigh. No, those are Dad's favorite pieces. She asks for a wing, and no again, those are Mom's favorite pieces.

Now we are 3 years in, planning a wedding & my MIL is overjoyed and even proposed to cover most of the wedding expenses.

Needless to say, I always felt I ""lucked out"" on a MIL.

Thing is, my bf is not the only son of my MIL. There is also a younger son who is already married (5 years) and I have to admit... The way MIL treats me and his wife, let's call her Kate, is like day and night.

With Kate she is cold, unwelcoming, sometimes even passive-agressive. At first I thought it is because Kate is just as cold and mean to MIL but I got a short version of the story from my bf after some coaxing. Apparently MIL simply disliked Kate from the very beginning and as the relationship got closer to marriage MIL got progressively colder until she outright encouraged the brother to break up with her because he can do better than Kate. That got shutdown real quick so MIL just settled on making it clear to Kate that she disapproves of her by simply ignoring her, excluding her or acting very coldly yet polite enough so bringing it up seems like an overreaction. 

I actually kept a friendly relationship with Kate from the get go and Kate sometimes ranted about the ""monster-in-law"" but otherwise seemed to be happy at least MIL isnt mean to me. But...recently during family dinner (FIL's birthday) when Kate was present, MIL said how happy she is that I will finally be an official part of the family and, since we seem to not be able to settle for an engagement ring (we got engaged without it), she would like to give me her grandmother's ring as she ""finally has a daughter to give it to"".

After hearing that Kate stormed out with her husband on her tail. Later I called Kate and when she finally picked up she said that she is done with me and MIL. She screamed a lot but a short version is that I am just as bad as MIL in treating her like shit because I keep taking whatever MIL gives me and never tell her off for being ""a cruel and petty woman"". I apologized but she said that if I want to apologise I need to do it with *the* ring. I said it's not mine to give. It ended at that.

My roommate will sometimes eat over half of what I buy.

I've since started to hide food in my room and bought a fridge/freezer with a lock on it.

0,"WIBTA if I stopped closing one section of my curtains at night? | Hello Reddit! This is my first text post I've ever posted on reddit, so I apologize for any formatting issues. So this is a petty thing, but I want to know if I am being a bad neighbor or not. Some background: my studio apartment is actually just the top level of a house, and it sits directly across from another home. There used to be trees separating our homes to give some privacy, but they were recently cut down to get a view of the mountain behind us, so that is why this is only now becoming an issue.

&#x200B;

Recently I got a text from my landlord saying that the neighbors across the way asked me to close my curtains when it gets dark because the light shines into their bedroom window, and they go to bed at 8PM while I tend to turn my light out at around midnight. At first I profusely apologized and closed the one side that I keep open at night. However as a few weeks went by I started to get annoyed at the situation. I started thinking about the fact that if my light bothers them, why don't they just get their own curtains? It doesn't look like they have any curtains or shades anywhere on their home. Why is it my responsibility? But at the same time I don't want to be rude and affect their sleep. I'm conflicted.

I've ordered from this company several times before, and in spite of the fact that the store is less than a mile away, it almost always takes at least an hour for the food to actually arrive.  I generally don't mind because it's still reasonably warm and is within the time frame for me to eat dinner, but the delay is definitely noticeable.

The deliver person (male, 20-24ish) arrived approximately an hour and twenty minutes after I received my order confirmation, and handed everything over.  However, after I said thanks and went to shut the door, he mumbled something, put my receipt on the pizza box, and then put three quarters on the box before turning and walking away.

My wife already had to stay behind last year on a trip to London under similar circumstances due to late term pregnancy. I took my mother with me last year, we had a great time but I know my wife was disappointed that she couldn’t come but she understood. 

Last year this time we discussed if it was possible that she might be able to travel with me this year, but we came to the conclusion that it might not be a great idea to take a seven month old on an 11 hour flight to Europe, and also leave behind our two other very young kids with a grand parent for a whole week. I felt so confident in our decision that since I had such a great time last time with my mom I’d invite her to come along again to Paris and she’s been super excited all year. I never would have taken that step unless I knew that we wouldn’t go back on that decision. Oh boy. 

Fast forward to today... I’m chatting with my wife about a conversation she had with a friend of hers and my business trip to Paris was brought up. She suddenly thought “why wasn’t she coming with me to Paris”, and now she wants to go. The event coordinator already has the travel dates in place, the tickets are almost ready to be purchased and I’m literally a day or two away from finalizing all of the travel details.

She said, “well it’s not too late”. ☠️

0,"AITA for not defending my cousin after he stole my baby name? | I’m currently 31 weeks pregnant with my first child- a little girl!  I’ve known for years what I want to name my child.  The first name has sentimental meaning for me, and my husband and I chose the second name together.  We’ve planned the name for years- when we were dating and talking about the future, one of the things we always said was that our firstborn would have this name.  It’s gender neutral, so it didn’t matter if it was a girl or a boy.  

As soon as we found out I was pregnant, we started referring to the baby by name.  Because we’ve had this name in mind for so many years, our whole family knows the name and the meaning behind it.  We’ve already started decorating the nursery with little items that have the name or initials on them. There’s basically been no question that this would be our child’s name.

My cousin’s wife gave birth two weeks ago.  They had refused to tell anyone what name(s) they were thinking about during the pregnancy, which is fine.  But the name that they ended up choosing is pretty much exactly the same as the name my husband and I chose for our baby.  It’s exactly the same first name and then an almost identical second name.  It would be like if our baby’s name was Mary Elizabeth, then the name they chose is Mary Eliza. The actual name isn’t as traditional/common as that, so it really does stand out as being the same name.

I was pretty upset when I found out, because they definitely knew the name we’d chosen and it feels weird and kind of spiteful to use it.  I know we don’t own the name or anything, so we can’t stop them from using it, but it still felt pretty icky.  My husband and I basically decided to just be sort of privately weirded out but to try our best to ignore it.  I sent my cousin a text to tell him and his wife congrats on the baby, and then didn’t reach out any further than that. I didn’t say anything to him about the name.

Well, it turns out that even though my husband and I are trying to take the high road here, the rest of the family is pretty mad.  Apparently, a bunch of them (including my cousin’s mom) have reached out and told my cousin and his wife that what they did is really shitty and that they need to think about changing their baby’s name. They’ve also reached out to me to say that they think it’s awful and that they know how much meaning the name has for me.  I absolutely didn’t ask them to do this, but I can’t pretend I’m not happy that people are “taking our side.”

My cousin called me yesterday and said that I need to call all of our family and tell them to stop pressuring him about the name and that I’m fine with it, because they’re ruining his and his wife’s time with their newborn.

I'm reorganising my bedroom. My room is fairly small and I don't have a lot of space, so I decided to take out my chest of drawers and put a hanging shoe rack and some over the door coat hangers in. One is over my actual bedroom door holding my coats/jackets, and I decided to put my collection of plaid shirts on the other. There are other plain shirts on this rack but they're all buttoned and dad hates all of them. I can't hang them inside my wardrobe because due to my reorganisation the space they used to occupy is now taken up with jeans/joggers, non buttoning shirts, and shoes.

I finished everything up yesterday and I really like it, but dad has come in, seen the shirt rack, and just rolled his eyes. Next time he came in he asked if I had to put those there and I told him the wardrobe wouldn't shut with it inside.

So you know how you should always keep in your mind that whatever you tell someone, they're probably going to tell their partner what you said. I kind of understand this, as the partner is someone you can share everything with. I just dont see it that way. If a friend tells me something, nobody gets to hear it unless he says otherwise, or i need advice (in which case i'm never specific about details and such).


Now my gf is the complete opposite, whenever i tell her something, even in private, or if you can reasonably think nobody else needs to know, she goes around and tells just about everyone she knows. Not just her best friend or mom or whatever, but co-workers as well. At first i didnt care, i made sure to not talk to her about stuff i didnt want shared. 

However, last summer i did drugs on a festival for the first time in my life (weed and xtc) and she got mad i didnt tell her immediately (i told her the day after, since i was still in the moment when i first saw her). A few months ago a couple of her co-workers stopped by to pick her up so they could go to a work thing together. As they left one of the co-workers said i shouldnt do any drugs while my gf was away. Which froze me and made it uncomfortable for me as i didnt know they know. 

If this was everything i could just get over it and deal with it. But every time i go out, hang with friends or go to a party/festival or whatever she makes sure to tell me i should tell her whatever i do when i do drugs and what i did. Ok, i get it, she might be worried i get addicted or whatever, but it was one time half a year ago. I just want to enjoy myself and not have her nagging in the back of my head.

A while ago she told me something private about one of her friends, something nobody should know. To which i said i didnt need to know that and i then explained that this is the reason why i dont feel comfortable telling her everything i go through. Every time i want to tell her something i think about who else gets to know it and need to decide whether or not i want them to know it as well.

0,"AITA for refusing to do Thanksgiving with my boyfriend’s family every other year, even though I previously agreed to? | I am generally all about sticking to your word, but this one has me in a corner. Early on in our relationship, my boyfriend and I agreed that since we wanted to spend holidays together, we’d alternate each year between his parents and my parents for Thanksgiving. Both of our sets of parents live within 30 min of us. The first couple years, it went well. Then, out of the blue, his parents told us one year that we would be going to have dinner with their extended family. Cool. Except his extended family lives a 5 hour drive away and they want us all to drive up there and back together. And we would be staying all weekend, Thurs-Sun.

It was a lot, but it was his year so I agreed. It was mostly great, but his extended family lives in the boonies with no internet access or cell reception. I got back Sunday night to a bunch of angry emails from my boss. I work in a demanding field where the expectation is you pretty much be available 24/7 unless you tell people (and even then it’s frowned upon). I explained that I hadn’t realized I wouldn’t have any access, accepted the reprimand, and moved on.

The problem is, for some reason, his parents now insist on doing this every year. According to my boyfriend they have always hosted thanksgiving at their house, but now they’ve decided his extended family will host every year.   So every other year, I am expected to take the car ride over with the family and spend the whole weekend there. I’ve done it twice and it’s always pretty inconvenient.

It’s his year again, but I’ve found out that I have been invited to go to a work conference shortly after thanksgiving this year. Because of prep, timing, and travel arrangements, I’ll need to fly out the night after thanksgiving. I told my boyfriend and offered to still come up there, but leave early by myself. He got upset. Apparently his family will find this incredibly rude.

This led to a fight where I finally said that I don’t want to go to his extended family every other year. He argued that I’d agreed to it and it was only fair, but I feel that this is way more than I agreed to and is unreasonable. We spend half a day with my family on my years and only have to travel an hour round trip. We spend 4 days with his family and travel 10 hours round trip to somewhere that’s so isolated, I can’t even respond to a work emergency, which makes me look bad.

I told him I wasn’t willing to do it anymore if his parents insist on going to extended family’s. At most, I’d be willing to do it every third year, and do the other two years with my family. He thinks this is incredibly unfair, since I previously agreed to split evenly and since it means his parents have to either choose to host every other year (and not go see extended family) or only see him on Thanksgiving every third year.

I'm pretty sure I'm TA, but some outside perspective will help. Basically I (30f) was raised by a single mom, and my biological father wanted nothing to do with me. 

My mom was unknowingly the secret girlfriend, and when she got pregnant he threatened her repeatedly, then left with a third (entirely different woman). Shortly after I was born we moved far away and didn't really look back.

I started asking questions about him when I was six, and by chance she happened to get his work number. He agreed to meet in a pizza shop back in our home state, I got one awkward photo, and then a week later he basically moved his entire company into hiding (changed the name, moved addresses, changed numbers). My mom was in tears - I think she felt like she let me down. While she's always been the Lorelei to my Rory and I didn't really need anyone else, it still messed with me hard.

So for a little more context, I have three older half sisters via bio dad. One is only three months older than me, and actually went to school with and was best friends with my cousin. I could have easily gotten their information and told them - even in the last ten years, I've stumbled upon their social media accounts, and still never reached out. 

The last few months I've been really considering getting one of those Ancestry kits. Part of it is curiosity for my family tree (big Irish family, our reunions are gigantic, would be cool to see who else is in it). But if I'm being totally honest, a bigger part is to just leave a potential land mine for my bio dad to find. 

I never asked for money, or a relationship, but he treated me like a disease to keep hidden, and I want him to feel some kind of consequence. A letter telling him how well I did without him wouldn't cut it, he doesn't feel remorse for his actions.

I feel that it was sort of inappropriate to ask me given that was sometime ago, and as an artist, my immediate response would of course say it was bad, as I would compare it to what my current skill/style is.

What I told her was that I think the edits I did were on par with the other work I did in that same year. But, Jane kept harping on this exact topic. So, I brought up the fact that I asked her at the minimum two times what she thought of the product, with no responses, other than it looks 'good'. Then I added, if you truly feel that I did not meet your expectations, I will refund you. She did not want that, stating 'I just want you to know how I feel about this matter.'.

1,"AITA for telling my sister to be more tidy when she comes to visit me? | My sister is almost 4 years younger than me...however sometimes it feels like the age difference is much more. Anyway since we have gotten older we have gotten closer but we still have points of large disagreement that make both of us question if we want to be friends lets alone sister. The most recent one is me asking her to be tidy in her next visit.  


Background is she is a huge help when she comes to visit me with my new baby ( her niece) but also it feels like I have to clean after her or my husband complains of some more courteous things she could do to accommodate every one while she is visiting like: not watching the tv in the living room on a show that only she wants to watch, having it too loud, or what he would considers cackling to loud but for me I am used to it, folding up blankets at the completion of use, washing out dishes and putting them away, and cleaning the guest bathroom once she departs if excess dirt is left (i.e. toilet stains or make up on counters). These things feel like common guest stay things to me but then when I asked her to do them. Her response made me felt like I was being an a-hole. 

&#x200B;

She mentioned how she cleaned our entire kitchen once and cooked thanksgiving dinner another time (it was on actual thanksgiving), says she has to walk on eggshells around me and it doesn't feel comfy at my home. Also, she thinks I don't give these types of rules to other people when they stay with me. I tried to recall all of our past occupants and I can't say that I've had to give as much instructions partly because they were imo ""good"" guest. However, she had me questioning did I give them passes for things I would have harped on her about. I liked the things she has helped with but do those things override the perceived messiness?

&#x200B;

Its like I want her to feel comfy and relaxed but I also don't want to clean after somebody within reason when they come visit, sister or not.... Or do close family members get a pass when they visit and don't need to be as tidy as lets say a non close family member or friend.

On the 13th of the month, I contracted the mover and  specifically asked to confirm for the 27th. He said “Yes!” over text and I felt it was done. The Friday before ( 27 th was a Monday) I reached out and asked when to expect him. He said he did not have me down but could get me in the first Monday of the next month. I was really agitated and we went back and forth for a bit.

After that I was very upset and posted a review on google and yelp along with screenshots of our conversation. He texted me again the next day basically saying he would pursue legal action if I didn’t take this down. He also responded to the reviews with his point of view, which I think is fair for other users to see. 

At that point I considered it done, I’d put my perspective out there and he had as well. However a month later, he has texted me again requesting I take it down as it is hurting his business. I do not want to as 1) I feel I was fair about my experience working with him and included screenshots so others could decide themselves and 2) almost all of his other reviews for years back are 5 stars, so people can see plenty of other peoples experience as well, 3) I feel as though he is apologizing now that threatening me did not work.

I don't remember my father, everything I know is from eavesdropping on my older brother and sister. He refused to marry my mother because of tax reasons or so he claimed but one day just left her to raise four kids (technically he only knew about three because my mom didn't know about my little brother until afterwards).

Fast forward Christmas/New Years of 2019 I get a Facebook message from someone claiming to be my half brother, he admits he didn't even know we existed until he went through his father's things (he had recently died) and found some old pictures of us as kids and a half full journal.

He had been cheating on my mother since sometime after my older sister was born, and even had a child with the woman around the same time I was born (I'm older by a month), his mistress finally wised up and gave him an ultimatum, her or us... he chose to leave behind three (soon to be four) kids and a woman who despite being abused her whole childhood to the point she looks like a druggie (little to no teeth, terrible skin, etc.) Was the most caring and hardworking person you could meet, for someone prettier and younger with only one mouth to feed. And the killer thing was? They got married within the year.

Karma is of course a bitch and they got divorced within a few years and she left him with their son as she presided to jump off the face of the earth.

Now I don't hate my half brother, it's not his fault our father made like Zeus and thought with his dick instead of his brain, but I did tell him that while I didn't mind being Facebook friends it wouldn't be a good idea reaching out to everyone else especially my mom. She hates everything about my father; his name, the kind of car he owned (Chevrolet Camino, if anyone owns that car especially an older model in orange, just know there's a fifty year old woman who wants to destroy it), the only exception are her kids because in her mind we're her babies not his.

My older brother and sister wouldn't be any better because unlike me who was too young to remember, they do, and they still hope that he burns in hell, because when he left we all had to move in with our emotionally abusive grandmother.

Well during one of those days she happened to come upon my pregnancy tests which I had hidden deep into my personal drawer. At the time I had no idea of this but when I became aware of it a lot of things started to make sense.

She always used to tease me about being pregnant every single chance she got. I would laugh it off because I was nowhere near ready to tell anyone much less her. She continued this for about a month straight and it became so persistent to the point that I confronted my husband thinking he had somehow let it slip. 

When I was around three months pregnant we decided to finally let his family know. We were so excited to tell them and even planned everything out. They seemed so unsurprised by the news and just smiled and nodded their head. Well as it turned out my husbands cousin had took it upon herself to tell them I was pregnant as soon as she had found the pregnancy test knowing very well that we had told no one.

0,"AITA for not giving dad 3 grand? |  I've never been close to my parents - as a child I spent 80% of my time with my g-parents and the remaining 10% with my M&D. They weren't young parents, they had no addictions, health issues, or money issues that would make them unable to look after me, they just often didn't know what to do with a child. To this day it affects our relationship as I am much closer to my grandparents than them.

I graduated school with good grades and I got a place at my local university which was within reasonable travel distance of my town. My parents were proud and bragged about this to their friends, and it was nice to have some support for once. However, when it came to the question of paying fees they passed the buck to my grandparents, who have supported my parents on and off throughout their marriage. 3 years of college was 3 grand each year. I didn't qualify for a grant because my parents yearly income comes over the cut-off mark, but as I was to find out my parents had poor spending habits and this yearly income didn't come close to entering our house.

I couldn't get a loan at the time because I was underage. I was doing bit-work like dog walking, baby-sitting, etc. My mother had planned on getting a loan, but was already paying off one for her new car and wasn't too keen on having another one open -same with my dad. They began discussing me not going to college - which my g-parents objected to, saying that they should have had some savings or some plan for me. So my g-parents paid for one year of my college, and I had a promise from M&D they would pay for next year and that they would help me with travel expenses in the meantime, which they ultimately did not. I was a little miffed that they took the credit of my g-parent's efforts to have me study and get good grades but didn't plan on helping me get to college when I couldn't do it myself.

Then, nearly 2 years ago, I was in a car accident with my father and sister and I have just recently received my compensation. My dad and sister got theirs a year ago, but mine took longer (legal reasons or something). When my father had money he gave me three grand to pay for my second year and I was told I was to give that money back. He spent his compensation within the year - buying himself a computer system worth €1000. Now that I have my money, he keeps demanding it because he needs to buy a new suit and he doesn't have the money to get a patio done outside. My gran is furious and has forbidden me to give him any money. The money has to go into the rest of my education, then what's left maybe to a masters or a car. I think it's important to save what I have in case I need it for a down payment for an apartment or anything that might come up in the next few years of my life. He claims that they will help me out if/when that happens and even will pay for my masters, but given their rep of promising help and then changing their minds, I don't trust them.

One year in college, Easter and spring break didn't line up and I was on campus for the holiday. On Easter Saturday (the day before Easter), my friend and I realized that it was almost Easter and neither of us had eaten a Cadbury creme egg yet. This was in the US, so we didn't have the creme bars to eat the rest of the year.

We went to about five places in our small college town - no creme eggs. So we took the bus to the nearest city and looked all over there. Wal-mart was maybe the eighth or ninth place we tried. They didn't have any single eggs to buy, but they had a spot on the shelves for the boxes of four eggs.

The space on the shelf was empty, except for one box where someone had already opened it and taken some of the eggs. There were two eggs left in the box, one of which had a dent on top. Because we knew the store wasn't selling single eggs - there was no spot for them on any shelves - we figured that the eggs would get thrown out in case there was something wrong with them. We decided the odds of the eggs having something wrong with them were low, so we ate the eggs and went home.

They went out with two other friends in the evening. They called me and told me that they were stuck in traffic on the other side of the city. They wanted to order a pizza ( which can take two hours on Friday nights ) and they wanted me to answer the door. They said I could have some because it was an extra large pizza.

The pizza got there pretty quickly (45 minutes). I had a few pieces. Then a few more. Before I knew it I had just mindlessly eaten a good portion of the pizza. I felt really bad. And left cash on the bar to pay for what I had done. 

When my roommate walked in with other roommate and her fiends she started yelling and throwing a fit asking what happened to the pizza. I told her I was sorry, and that I left money on the bar.

When I planning to get a new tat done I was talking to my family and my cousin popped up that his wife was an tattoo artist and she was setting up a new studio.  After talking to her, she seemed to know what she was doing. The only thing that bothered me was her rate was quite a bit lower than other studios (tats are something you don’t want to be cheap on) .

Anyway tattoo was done and I liked the it. So a few months later I got the itch for another one. I contacted her , sent the design (she normally only does things she has pre designed or things clients find and send her). When I got the quote it was 3 times what I expected. 

I sort of made an awkward joke question as to why so much and she sent me her new rates and an explanation that since she had established herself she felt it was time to raise her prices. While I understood this her new rates were higher than some of the more established studios and were matching the higher end studios (you know artists with 20 years experience and a 1 year  waiting list to see them).

I didn’t want to pay that much but I felt awkward saying no since she was family. I got it done and it is good though I felt as it was not worth what she charged but I kept my mouth shut because I’m not an expert in this. 

Recently the itch hit me again and I was discussing it with a woman at work and she told me her husband is an artist at one of those high end studios I mentioned.  She texted her Husband and she got me an appointment within a weekend for a design consultation and a week after that a date to have to done.  The rate was the same as what my cousin’s wife charged. 

I got the tat done and I love it. Unfortunately  since they are side by side I can see the higher quality in it  (plus it being wholly original) than the ones done by my cousins wife. The next week I was at a family gathering and my cousins wife saw it  (they are all on my arms so obvious), asked where I got it done and what it cost me. We left it at that. 

Later that evening I got a text from cousin asking why I didn’t get his wife to do my tat as she would have charged the same amount. I tried to explain about the artist and how I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to have him do it.

My cousin went off , saying they are insulted that I didn’t think her work was as good as this artist. He said if his wife had kept her rates lower he bets I would have had her do it. The thing is this partly is  true. I would have still gotten my last tattoo done by the high end artist but now I see the difference in quality I won’t  go back to my cousins wife’s while she charges that rate.

0,"AITA for moving out of my apartment since my lease is being canceled. | So about 4 months ago my GF and I started to notice a pretty severe black mold problem in our apartment. I live with my girlfriend and 3 other roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. The problem continued to worsen. The landlord consistently failed to remedy the situation. Finally, we decided enough was enough. I got with all my roommates and we discussed our options. We all came to agreement that everyone wanted out of the lease “at all costs”. 

Luckily, I have a family member that is a lawyer and specializes in property and tenant disputes law. I told my roommates I could contact him and he would help us free of cost. They all agreed this was a great option. 

After contacting my family member, he sent a letter to our landlord. Basically it gave them the legally required time to fix the problem or else our lease would be cancelled after a month from when they received the letter. It also said that it would be best for both parties if they just flat out let us out of the lease. 

After this was explained to me, I went straight to my roommates. My GF and I showed them the letter and asked for their approval. Which they quickly gave us. I told them explicitly there is a chance the lease could end sooner, so look for a place no later than the end of the month. After that my family member sent off the letter. 

A few weeks after this we receive notice the landlord is letting us out of the lease. We need to provide them with the date we will all vacate the apartment. As soon as we heard this we texted our roommates informing them of the situation. My GF and I had found an apartment for the end of the month, as I had informed the others to do as well. We told them we would be moving out at the end of the month and we asked them when  they would like to vacate and end the lease. One roommate then told us it sounded like we had already made a plan and were leaving them “high and dry no matter what”. We then informed her the lease would not end when we left, but instead when they found a new place. In the past we have even offered for them to stay with us at our new place until they can relocate. 
We also told her we would still help clean our part and assist them in moving as much as possible even if we leave first. 

She is currently being distant and somewhat cold to us. We do not want to leave her high and dry in the slightest, but she believes we are. AITA?

Quick backstory on the clickbaity title: I (f/31) have a brother (30) and, surprise, two parents. My family has never been close, even as a kid. While we never lacked anything (food, clothing, schooling), my parents were a bit abusive growing up, so establishing a positive emotional connection was difficult. I moved out when I was 18, never visited much. We keep in touch as in talk on the phone every few weeks and see each other about once a year. I call on their birthdays, they call on mine. I don't keep in touch with my brother at all as we have zero stuff in common. I text on his birthday, he usually forgets mine. That's our relationship. That all worked fine up until about four months ago.

&#x200B;

In December, I got engaged to my gf of five years. My parents know and like this girl. I texted them a picture of the ring, they said congrats, all good. In March, we sent out the save the dates, including one to my parents. In our next phone call after receiving it, they asked whether my brother was also invited. I said no, as we are keeping it to a minimum (30 people including us) and since my brother and I don't talk at all, he doesn't fall in that category. They said hm, ok and that was it. Or so I thought.

&#x200B;

Four days later, my mother calls me. She basically yelled and cursed at me for 15 minutes, telling me how much I suck for not inviting my brother, that I'm ruining the family, bla bla and that she won't be attending. I didn't really get to say anything and when she was done, I just sarcastically said ""well, if you're not coming that saves us some money"". This is pretty much me to the core, so a sarcastic snark from my side shouldn't have surprised her. Well apparently it did and she just hung up. This was my last conversation with her.

Now to the WIBTA part. All of my family's birthdays are in June. I texted my father on his (we briefly spoke on the phone afterwards, nothing relevant), texted my brother on his (a two line conversation as usual) and now my mother's is coming up and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I do feel it's a bit petty to just ignore her birthday, on the other hand, she said some awful things to me, apparently expects ME to apologize (according to my father) and I really don't want to be the person to break the silence even though she fucked up. My gf agrees with me, however I've seen some pretty insightful responses on this sub so I thought I'd also give it a shot.

I also received stocks which grew enough to the point that I was able to purchase my first home a year ago, and moved in last week. Prices for homes are inflated where I live and I was able to purchase a townhouse for a little over 600,000. A  3-4 bedroom detached home is in the range of a million dollars.

I threw a housewarming party and invited my family, including my sister (32) and her husband (35). My sister’s husband did not have a job until he was 30 (when he got married to my sister) and as a wedding gift, his father gave him the downpayment for his first home which was around the same price as mine (although much bigger).  He flipped the home after a few years of its value exploding, returned his father’s downpayment and purchased a beautiful home. My BiL also receives cheques from his parents each month on top of his salary (\~35-40k a year) to help accommodate for their somewhat lavish lifestyle. I don’t see anything wrong with that, his parents want to help him, I'm just providing context onto how he might perceive wealth.

I told him that his first home cost the same amount as this one, and that the housing market is just more expensive now. He shrugged it off and stopped for a while.

After, as I was serving dinner, he commented to my sister (that I overheard) that everyone was packed in so tightly together in the dining room that I didn’t need heating. It was the final straw and I called him out and lost my voice at him. I told him to get out, and asked if he needed help getting the silver spoon pulled out of his ass.

0,"AITA for lying about why I don't drink? | I don't think I am, but people have gotten upset with me in the past about it, several times, so now I'm asking. 

I (19f) enjoy going to bars with friends, I love the dancing and playing pool. But I don't drink alcohol. Some of my friends have pushed me a bit to try it in the past, saying that I would be 'more fun' (I took some offence to that) if I had a few drinks. Most of them are okay with it now though. 

But a few times people who I've chatted with in the bar have gotten me drinks, and have taken super offence to me not accepting them. I've been told that I should just drink it to be polite, or that I shouldn't be in a bar if I don't drink. Bugging me about 'just giving me one good reason why I don't drink.' 

Plus just in general conversation (usually in bars, not always) people can get exceedingly pushy about wanting to know why, as if it's some strange thing. No one bugs me about not smoking cigarettes, but alcohol seems to be some weird thing when you say no. 

So if they keep pushing for an answer I give them one, usually in a sad backstory form. Because I don't want to share the real reason, and some people just won't take no for an answer. 

Some of my friends called me an asshole for this, because it bums everyone out and lying is always wrong. I don't disagree, I just think it's justified.

I don't care if we have a boy or a girl. Doesn't matter either way to me. We could do it naturally, but there would be a great risk to not only the unborn baby, but Mom as well.  Because of the testing that needs to be done on the embryos for the genetic markers (dunno if that the right term) we will not only know if the embryos have the protein that caused the condition in our first child, but also we would know the genders. At least thats what we were told from the Docs. There will be multiple embryos that they have to test, so feasibly it could be all girls, or all boys, or a combo of the two. My concern was that because we will be working with the IVF clinic so much, they might get familiar enough with us where they subconsciously, use an embryo for a gender based on their prior knowledge of us as a couple. To prevent this I suggested flipping a coin to decide the gender if it comes to that. I was told by a few different people that I am being callous and not taking the process seriously enough.

So I'll try to keep it reasonably short.

I'm (M20) currently a 3rd-year University student in a small off-campus apartment with 2 other roommates who we'll call Dave (M20) and Steve (M24). We each have our own room and a small common area/kitchen. We're all on separate lease agreements, paying $680/month all utilities, parking included. 

One of my roommates, Dave, has been dating a girl since September of this school year (Sarah F18), whom Steve and I really do not enjoy, though we respect her and coexist. ***Last semester after only a week of dating, she would stay at our apartment 6-7 days of the week, for 3 weeks in a row with absolutely zero consent from Steve and I - nor does she make any form of contribution in cleaning, cooking, or rent.***

So back in October we sat down Dave and said okay, you're not respecting our boundaries here, and while we don't want to restrict you seeing her, we would prefer she stay no more than 3 nights a week. Dave seemed very receptive in conversation...but his behavior does not change all the way through December (I was too busy with school to make this a worry). Also just note our lease doesn't allow SO to move in without being on a separate lease.

***He completely ignored any compromise we set, and I now fear I must put my foot down.*** So here we are in February, and Dave decides to (or failed out, we don't know) take a semester off of school. Two weeks into the semester, Dave doesn't have a job and his girlfriend stays here all day and all night; they smoke weed in the apartment without even opening a window and playing video games through all hours of the night (just to set the tone of the attitude we're dealing with).

Listen, I'm aware I'm not Dave's father here, but Steve and I are both STEM majors and have quite a bit of homework to do, and seeing Sarah on my couch every single day starts to wear at me. My home is truly one of the only places I can unwind, and she's taking that away from me.

My current proposal draft: She stays no more than 3 nights a week, every week. If more, she can pay $340 to Steve and I (split) in addition to Dave's rent. WIBTA?

0,"AITA for not lending my sister and her boyfriend money | I’m (19F) a full-time student and work part-time and receive welfare from my community at home. I make around $800/month, but am very good when it comes to saving money and spending my money wisely. This has led to me lending money to family members (parents/siblings) when they’re really struggling, but for my parents and younger sister, they rarely ask (maybe once every couple of months) and always pay me back on the day we agreed on. On the other hand, my older sister (22) and her boyfriend (\~30) ask me for money multiple times a month, and when I do lend them money they never pay me back on time and then ask for more money just a few days later.

Recently, my older sister and her boyfriend have been struggling a lot financially. Her boyfriend got into a car accident and was deemed at fault, so his insurance only covered a small amount of the damages. Due to this, he lost his only means of transportation and was no longer able to work. He applied for EI but hasn’t heard back yet. My sister is on disability and receives enough to cover her rent, bills and food, with around $150 left for other expenses each month. They both smoke cigarettes and weed, and get take out for most meals, so they blow any extra money they have just a couple days after she gets her cheque.

Since her boyfriend lost his job, he has been messaging me nonstop asking to lend him money. I explained to him that I only have enough in my checking account to cover my expenses until my next payday, and if I touch my savings I will get charged a fee for it, so I can lend him money when I get paid next if he still needs it. He messaged me daily for the 5 next days asking over and over again for me to lend him anywhere from $50-200 and I told him the same thing each time.

I spoke to my mom about it and she told me that they have been doing the same to her and my dad and they have been saying no each time. My mom has been helping them financially since they got together a few years ago and even let them live at my parents house until they could afford an apartment. Both my mom and I helped them with stuff for their apartment and I even took a day off to help them move. My mom told me not to lend them money anymore, so they will learn to manage their money and save, rather than relying on my family to help them whenever they are broke.

I got paid yesterday and woke up to a message from both of them asking me to lend them $200. I told them no, and that I wasn’t gonna lend them money anymore unless it was an emergency. This led to my sister calling me and screaming at me over the phone saying I promised them I would help and all this stuff. I told her that they need to go and get jobs and stop wasting all their money on junk they don’t need.

We all agreed that I would take on the main dish, the beef wellington, since I have made it successfully before and everyone's been wanting to try it. I had absolutely no issues at all at this point in time since everyone else's dishes sounded great as well.

Eventually, as we drew nearer to the date, everyone had changed from their original dishes to something else. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but their changes have all been to something of significantly reduced quality. This is what it came down to before I finally made my change:

* Friend 1: Maple bacon cornbread => Nothing, will pitch in $ to whoever makes it for him (no one offered so I took the offer) + will bring beers. Reason: Has to take his nieces out before the dinner and has no time to make it
* Friend 2: Chicken tikka masala mashed potatoes => regular mashed potatoes. Reason: Didn't have the tikka masala ingredients and didn't want to go buy it.
* Friend 3: Homemade pumpkin pie => Grocery store pie. Reason: Her oven doesn't work
* Friend 4: Pesto Pasta Salad => Regular salad, asked if I had ranch in my fridge. Reason: She messed up the pesto
* Friend 5: Home cured duck prosciutto with some other charcuterie meats and cheeses  => Just the store bought meats and cheeses. Reason: He accidentally ate too much of the duck prosciutto and is saving what's left for his family's Thanksgiving dinner
* Friend 6: Lobster mac and cheese => Nothing. Couldn't make it anymore

After all this, I was less compelled to make my beef wellington since it's a lot of time/work/money to make it in comparison to everything else, plus I now had to make the cornbread. I told the group that I was no longer making the wellington and that I would just make a roasted duck instead and no one was happy. Some discussed just cancelling the dinner since it's a shell of our original plan, some suggested we just go out to a restaurant, others called me out for being spiteful.

0,"WIBTA if I don't invite my sister to my wedding | Long story short, my sister got married a few years ago and I did not get a plus one to her wedding, despite being in the wedding party and everyone else getting a plus one.  

I specifically did not get a plus one because she thought my date would cause me to be the center of attention and not her. Why? I'm a lesbian and had only come out recently (a few months after she got engaged). If I brought a date, it would have been a woman. 

Specifically...the woman I am going to marry now. 

On top of not getting a plus on to her wedding, my sister also insisted I must wear a dress/makeup/shave my legs at her wedding (I don't exactly own or look good in dresses - short hair, hairy legs, etc). Despite my misgivings, I compiled and felt embarrassed and shoved into the closet all day at her wedding. 

It was awful, but I was prepared to forgive her until my relationship with my SO started getting extra serious and she blurted out from nowhere one day ""Don't make me wear a suit in your wedding"". 

I was absolutely floored. She totally understood how badly she made me feel and it feels like she does not respect my relationship.

I arrived at the crowded airport and went to the terminal. A couple minutes after they said they’d be there. They weren’t there. I waited a few minutes and then called my brother, who didn’t pick up. I called again just as a guy working for the airport waved at me to move on since I wasn’t allowed to park there. I warned my brother I’d have to leave, do a circle, and come back. He said “okay, do a few circles, we’ll be a minute.”

I circled several times, which sucked, until they got there and all piled in the car. I saw they had a big bag full of fresh bagels, so the time they were in the airport was them stopping for food. I was excited because I was hungry. They passed them all out and I didn’t get one. I said in sort of a joking way, “you didn’t get me one? Awww” and a girl laughed like that was ridiculous and said “no.”

I drove them back and mentioned the whole thing to my parents. My dad was mad at me for even mentioning it and being upset, saying that I didn’t have to get up at 3 am like they did and maybe they were stressed out and had more important things on their mind than getting “spoiled” me a bagel.

Me = 19 M
Nephew = 4 M
Sister (nephews mom) = 26 F

So it was Christmas Day and my family likes to play games after dinner. My nephew got some kind of new game that was like superhero bingo; basically you have a small board with your superhero on it and you have to turn over random cards to find the ones that match the pictures on your board. If the card you choose doesn’t match your board, you put it back.

My nephew was winning because he had 5/6 cards matched on his board. I caught up to him. On my next turn I turned over a card with a rocket ship on it, which didn’t match my board but did match his.

It was my sisters turn after mine but my nephew grabbed the matching card and put it on his board. I took the card back, put it in the group of cards upside down, and messed them around so he couldn’t find it. 

He had a freaking MELTDOWN; crying about how mean I was and how he almost won. I told him it wasn’t his turn and it’s not fair that he memorized where the card was. 

Well now my sister and everyone are acting like I’m some big jerk. My defense is, he has to learn sometime that he can’t win every game.

I'd like to start out that I feel super selfish and I just seriously cannot tell if I would be the asshole.


My boyfriend is a super charitable. His parents raised him that way. Because of this, in his family, they often make donations to various charities as Christmas gifts instead of physical gifts. They literally cry when they receive these types of gifts because of how much it means to them.


My boyfriend and I are moving in together. We aren't exactly well off. We don't have couches or a bed or a table. Literally we have a beanbag chair and a yoga mat. For Christmas I asked for something for the apartment. I gave a list. If not that, I would have loved some kind of diffuser or candles or makeup.


His gift to me was a $100 donation in my name to provide cows in a foreign country. This is where I get conflicted. Obviously this gift is with the best intentions and it helps someone less fortunate than me. However I really wish it was more personalized... I've given a list he could pick from and he decided to not pick from the list and make this donation to a charity I don't even care about... It's one he likes. And this was the only gift I got. 


I feel entirely selfish for not liking the gift because it is super charitable. But its just not what we needed. Im getting him a 7 course dinner at a fancy restaurant in Chicago (his favorite thing is food). I just don't know.

My sister is a different story. She came out to our dad when she was 17. I wouldn't say he's a bigot, but he wasn't overly supportive. He just said ""Okay, I respect you"". I guess, that's not what my sister was expecting.
 
So we just recently had his funeral. He had his will done old fashioned in an envelope. I was really shocked. I got his farmstead and the house. My sister got $100,000. Which is still a huge amount. I got about 90% of his assets, and my sister got about 10%. 
 
I know stereotypically this kind of money breaks siblings apart, but I never actually felt that our bonds could be broken, till now. My sister and brother are demanding that I sell the farmstead and to give them a third of the profits. They even threatened legal action, which my lawyer says is BS.

They never let us know they're going to buy her an item until afterward which means we get hit with a surprise request for reimbursement.

After a few miles of this, I pulled over so I could drive behind him. While driving behind him, I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and drove behind him with my highbeams on for about a mile.

0,"AITA for keeping a blanket my brother threw out (because of me)? | A few years ago I was living with my mom and brother at a place with a decent sized building attached, which we used for storage. It was mostly unorganized at the time, but my brother and I each kept most of our things in separate corners to better keep track of it. One day I was getting ready for a camping trip and gathering supplies from the building when I came across a box with a nice fur blanket in it. Since it wasn't in my brother's corner and looked like something my mom would have bought, I assumed it was hers- especially because it seemed to be worth 100-200$. She had told me before that I could use any of her things from the building on the trip, so I took it with me and used it over the weekend. I was probably an asshole for not making sure it was hers before I left, and when I returned it she said it was my brother's. I let him know right away and apologized.

At this point it might be relevant to mention that we don't have the best relationship; lots of drama from the past, though we've always been on speaking terms. In any case, he got very angry and started yelling at me. I don't remember the details but he was basically saying that I ruined it, should have checked before I borrowed it, stuff like that. It's important to mention the blanket wasn't dirty or damaged, but I offered to have it dry-cleaned since he thought it was. That only made him seem more angry, and he immediately took it to a trash bin outside and threw it in. I didn't want it to go to waste so as diplomatically as I could, I asked if I could keep it if he was just going to throw it away. That made him explode, and he yelled versions of ""no"" before leaving. In hindsight, I can kind of see why. Either way, later on I snuck it out of the trash and hid it in my room. 

I've only used it once since then, it didn't quite feel right so it's been in storage at my own place ever since. I don't really know what to do with it. I'd like to keep and use it, but I'd only be able to with a clean conscience. 

AITA for keeping the blanket? Should I tell my brother what I did and offer to give it back?

Last night my BF (24M) and I (21F) went to the movies with some of his friends. There were 5 guys in total including my BF, then me and one other girl. We went to an early evening show (6 ish) and went to those theatres where you can order food in the theatre and the ushers bring it to you. Once we all got settled it we ordered some food and drink.

Now I eat a vegan diet so my options when we all go out as a group is often limited, but this theatre actually had some vegan options.... better than most... but they were all super healthy, salads and bean grain bowls and I just... didn't want that. I kind of wanted some goddamn deep fried (period struggles) so I ordered wine and a fries for myself. Everyone else got something a little more substantial, like chicken tenders, a grain bowl, nachos, etc.

Here may be my mistake? When the food came, I gave my BF like 2 of my fries then happily took the rest for myself. All of his friends then started clamoring for fries since I don't think any of them had any with their meals. I said 'sorry this is essential my dinner and probably the only thing I'm gonna eat, just order some more for yourselves.' They started calling me greedy and stingy for refusing to share but there was like 4 of them besides my BF. If I gave them all fries, I wouldn't have enough for me. To me it made way more sense for them to just order more to share among themselves as a side, and they could wait since they already had their meals with them and the fries were my only meal.

He co-owns a house with a grandparent and I moved in almost three months ago when my lease ended. I initially planned on buying my own house but got laid off. I now have a new well paying job. 

My boyfriend basically lived with me from the beginning and I didn’t mind. I was invited to his house but rarely accepted because I feel most comfortable in my own place and like privacy. 

As mentioned before this house is co-owned with his grandmother. That is fine with me. My sticking point is getting annoyed with freeloading family members. He has two adult relatives who work (one works 60 hours a week) who won’t even pay the minimal amount he asked for (1/4 of what renting an apartment would cost). 

It irks me beyond belief to be paying rent for a house I don’t own while other adults live there for free. I don’t want to not pay but I feel like I’m subsidizing their housing. And it’s not my house. To be honest I don’t like sharing a house with other people and the rent issue magnifies that for me.

0,"AITA for backing out of an engagement because she quit and won't work once we are married? | A bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.

Now to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)

Her family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.

So now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.

I'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a ""real school"". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.

Now I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.

However I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.

Now apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.

So, our professor in college has a team-presentation; which counts towards the final grades. It’s marked as followed;
1. Class grade (where all students mark out of /5) 
2. Teammate grade (where your two other teammates mark out of /5)
3. Professor mark (where the professor marks out of /10)
to accumulate into a possible 20 marks. You, in addition, receive a breakdown, so you can see where you dropped (professor, teammates, or students.)

Alright, so in the class message group, the students all decided to mark each other 5’s and 10’s for their teammates, so everyone could get a grade boost. I disagreed, but said nothing.

On the day of the presentations, I marked fairly. Due to the low quality of the presentations, most got a 1 or a 2. In addition, I felt like my teammates slacked, so they both got a 3.

I have a friend, lets call her Helena, who is always skint. She has no money to do anything. We go out to eat and she makes us go to the cheapest place and then spends ages complaining about how expensive stuff is. She has two jobs but spends all of her money on absolute rubbish, like so many new clothes and haircuts and just stuff that she never uses. 

I was meant to go on holiday with Helena and three other friends next month. We booked a big house and we all paid except her, and she then pulled out, leaving us to cover the cost of the 5 bed house we rented between the 4 of us. In hindsight I wish we'd made her pay anyway but it's too late now. She pulled out because 'money is too tight, I'm down to just eating cereal'... and then she bought a goat. 

She's been thinking about it for ages (I actually made this throwaway a while ago to ask if I was ta for telling her not to get one, but then decided to tell her anyway and didn't post) and she finally got one last week. I just don't get it. She's going to keep it in the garden (she lives in a houseshare with a huge garden luckily) but it's expensive to keep an animal. I literally don't get why she's done it. 

I told her yesterday in a bit of a rage that I didn't appreciate her leaving us in the lurch so she could buy a damn goat, and that she had to learn to budget if she wanted us to keep inviting her out. I phrased it more rudely than that which probably does make me ta but I'm so sick of the nonsense at this point. Some of my friends are on my side and others say it's her life, her decision.

They made it clear during that visit that they would like to come back with me in the future because they had such a great time and I agreed and told them they are always welcome to join me.

Fast forward to now, my friend and her husband had their first child about 6 months ago.  He's a precious baby and I really do adore him.  My friends live about 6 hours away and I have visited them regularly because I love them like family and I want to be part of their child's life.

About 5 months ago I met a really amazing man.  I think he is the person who I will spend the rest of my life with and I love him dearly.

Since that time, a neighbourhood couple has been allowing their dog to poop in our garden nearly every day.  The poop is always in the same spot and it is very close to our front door. Since the garden is covered with weed cloth, it’s not like the poop can degrade into the soil and fertilize it; it just sits there on top of the cloth, smelling and attracting flies.  Since this began, we’ve also noticed a lot more flies in our house. I suspect that the increase in flies is related to the hoards of flies congregating on the poop near our front door. It’s gross and unhygienic and we have a new baby in the house who we’d like to keep away from dog feces to the extent possible.

He had really big issues with diamonds and I really wanted a diamond ring since young. I researched rings, and diamonds, and gold quality etc and because he couldn't put his views aside, he gave me the money and I got to buy whatever ring I wanted. I chose a simple solitaire ring and I remember it well. I put in lots of effort to find me a ring I really liked. Once he called off the engagement, I gave him the ring back. I know from speaking to him months after he had kept the ring and didn't know what to do with it. 

I have since moved on, gotten married and have a child with someone else. Recently, through mutual friends on social media, I saw he got married. After feeding my curiosity, I looked through his new wife's profile, and I saw my ring! My ex was cheap in our relationship so I know it's the same ring. I'm two minded about whether I should tell her or get someone else to tell her, or just leave it.

Yesterday I told a friend of mine that story and he told me I was a bit asshole, and I kinda see where he gets that.

So, I was 14 at that time, and I wanted to work. Instead of working a shit teen job, my mom offered me to ""volunteer"" in a school for disabled kids (7-10 yo) and she will pay me. So I did, and ""worked"" there for 2 months.

At the last day of the summer vacation the staff threw a surprise goodbye party for me with the kids, and all the staff told me that they were amazed by the fact I was volunteering there while all the other teenagers were busy drinking. (I was the only minor there).
At that moment I didn't had the guts to tell them my mom was paying me, and all I did was saying thanks over and over again.
They even bought me a small souvenir.
I would have told them if the subject of payment was brought up before.

0,"AITA for not wanting to subsidize my ex boyfriend's rent? | Hey folks, thanks in advance for your input. This situation is making me feel like I'm losing my mind.

After a 2 year relationship with many ups and downs, my ex boyfriend John broke up with me on the day we were supposed to move into a shared 1 bedroom apartment. The rent would have been extremely cheap split between the two of us, but shouldering the total alone would be kind of expensive. Not completely unmanageable, but definitely not ideal for either of our incomes. 

I have nothing against John and truly wish him the best, but living with a recent ex in a one bedroom, even in the most amicable of circumstances, is extremely awkward. I would like to live separately as soon as possible so I can begin to heal and move on. Both of our names are on the new lease, but I offered to move out and find temporary housing as I will be able to move in with two of my friends in January. John agreed to this and I began looking for housing. I have a lead on two reasonably priced rooms in shared houses that would allow me to move in before the end of the month. Both rooms cost about 100 to 150 dollars per month less than total cost of the new apartment. 

I let John know that I had found a few places and would probably be out within the next week or two. Later that night, he texted me that after talking about it with some of his coworkers, he has decided that it is unfair for him to shoulder the full cost of the rent once I move out. He thinks that I should have to offset the cost of his rent by around 200 dollars per month once I am no longer in the apartment, a little over a quarter of the full amount. 

I think that this is ridiculous. I let him know that I would be happy to pay the rent in full if I was the one who would be staying there, but I would not be financially contributing in any other circumstance. Also, before we broke up, I signed a parking lease at the new building that John will not be taking over because he doesnt have a car. 

So on top of the ordeal of moving again, finding a place to store my furniture, and paying for a parking spot I will not be using, he also expects me to help pay for him live alone in a nice apartment while I have to move in with strangers for for 6 months.

It's perfect because it gives them about half an inch of recline and then stops, so generally they just assume that's all the chair does and stop trying after a few pushes.

We book these trips at least six months out and because of schedules it’s really hard and basically impossible to change the dates after it’s booked or people won’t be able to go. 

My brother in law got engaged last year and when they picked a wedding date it was the same weekend as my trip with my friends.

1,"AITA for wanting my husband to pay for my daughter's college tuition? | I married my current husband seven years ago. He has three children from a previous marriage and I have my daughter from a previous one as well. Two of his children are in college right now and one graduated in May, and my daughter is starting high school in August.

I really want my daughter to go to a top tier school as my daughter has stated many times she wants to either go to John Hopkins, Stanford, NYU or Columbia. My stepchildren go to state colleges.

Yesterday, all of us were together for a birthday when I mentioned my daughter, M would start SAT classes. My eldest step son J remarked that he and his sisters B and R never took SAT prep and did just fine. This led me to discuss how M wants to go to a prestigious school that would demand a higher testing scores.

This led B, who for context purposes is always trying to start a fight even on a family occasion, to ask how M would get scholarships to go live somewhere and go to school at private colleges. Their father/my husband refused to allow his children (with agreement with their mother) to send off to private or out of state schools due to the high tuition.

So, it would not be that far fetched that now, with his children locked in their current schools that both of their parents wanted, that my husband and I would send my daughter to a nicer college. My ex-husband have not discussed yet what we would like for M, but my ex husband does have two kids with his new wife. I think my ex-husband would be fine if my husband and I paid for M's college tuition and expenses.

B hitched a fit that it wouldn't be fair for her siblings and herself if M got to go out of state. I told her that paying for three children to go out of state would be a lot of money, but that just paying for one is not as expensive. Also, I reminded them that their own mother agreed that they should stay in state for the lower tuition. B argued that her mother is still unmarried and could not afford the costs, so I had to repeat AGAIN that three children out of state is a heavy burden compared to one.  I also said that her father and I share finances so sending M to SAT prep and other things is my right to do. If my husband had wanted his children to go out of state with our money, I would not have been mad, which I told my stepchildren. It's really a matter to discuss with their own parents; not me. B then called me an ass, to which I told her to not use language like that. 

B told me I was being inconsiderate, so I had my husband ask her to back off and calm down to which she refused. 

B, even though she's an adult, acts very immaturely with her stepsister and always has, ever since we got married. B is eight years older than M but acts younger. I am taking her comments with a grain of salt, but I would like to gain outside opinions on this.

B and her siblings were quiet the rest of the evening, and B was probably trying to stir up more drama as it is. I'm getting tired, frankly, of how she is constantly undermining me in front of everyone when I'm really just trying to better my daughter's life. It's not my fault my husband and his ex-wife would not send their children out of state. His children act very entitled to our money but the way they conduct themselves causes me to doubt they really want a relationship with their father and instead just want our money. It's all about money to them. I know they are happy with their current education, but the second M gets something remotely nice they all freak out on me. 

So, do I really deserve to be called an ass when it's not my fault they're jealous and acting entitled?

And said garage was already a 1 car garage, so the drive way was built the same, to accommodate one car. Their is a little more space for another vehicle just to the right of the drive way, however... you need to jump the curb if their is a vehicle already in the driveway because its a smaller house. Jumping the curb is no issue with my vehicle if my roommate got the parking first. However backing out, because of the angle, will cause me to catch the bumper on the curb. Same for my roommate. So we either need to meticulously maneuver in reverse, every day we leave, managing not to hit the fence, each others vehicle and not jump said curb. Or park on street in front of the house. And here is where the problems start.

  Now that I've painted that picture, imagine the entire neighborhood built this way. Compact, small drive ways. Fortunately for us, it's just 2 people in the house. For everyone else who have multiple cars...well they need to park in the street in front of their house.... or in front of my house. Now I'm fully aware that people need to park and it's a public road so it's not illegal. But on several occasions they have parked so damn close to my driveway it makes it almost impossible to angle my way out in the morning. Come trash day it gets worse, they leave me no room to place my bins, so I simply place it in front of their vehicles. I have received at least 2 letters left at my door step telling me to stop and if the vehicles are damage their will be repercussions if there is damage. And well of course theres even more issues when they have company over. The shit thing here is... they have much bigger drive ways than me.. at least the the neighbors in front of me. They simply don't pack their cars in there. I drew the line when I came home one day and couldn't get in my drive way because one of their vehicles from a friend or family was blocking half the entrance. So I had it towed.

Then, the older cousin and his wife have their kid, and name their kid Evelynn. To our knowledge (and coming from aunt, as well) they didn’t really have a name picked out ever, and went with what they thought would be best the day their daughter was born. 

I don’t have a problem at all that they named their daughter Evelynn, after all, Grammy Eve was their grandmother too. My question is this, would we be the buttholes if we went ahead and named our daughter Evelynn too? 

Other than some family events being a little confusing, I can’t really see any issue with it, especially since we’re not super close, but I would hate to break some huge unknown social faux-pas. And we did have the name picked out first, even if their kiddo was born before ours.

Me and a close friend/coworker have made jokes in the past Toby and Karen are hooking up. we have seen signs of it but haven't caught them in the act. We've sort of except this is why Toby won't fire her. Lately, with so many issues on her part the joke has been something we're inviting more and more workers into. It's gotten to the point we've all agree it's probably going on. Now 2 people have quit right away when they heard this because they think that means Karen won't ever be fired and it's overall shady and unprofessional. Recently, one of our younger workers recently quit and expressed to me she liked Toby but knew it wouldn't go anywhere. However, working with him and Karen and the rumor has made her so uncomfortable she's decided to leave (she does have savings).

0,"AITA if I refuse to chip in gas money for a road trip? | A few weeks ago my roommate and I drove to Chicago for St. Patrick's Day. Usually for these trips, I would split the cost of gas with him, because he uses his car and it wouldn't be fair to ask him to front the cost of gas. We try to split everything and be as fair as possible. During the day, he told me that a friend of his was flying in from O'Hare Airport and wanted a ride from there back to our school, and if he gave her a ride then she would pay for gas.

So, his friend paid for the gas and tolls and we all drove back together. I thought that that meant the expense was taken care of, but he told me that I still need to pay for half the gas, even though his friend covered the entire thing herself. I told him that that didn't make sense cause neither of us put any money in so there was no cost to split, her friend covered the whole thing. He told me if it weren't for her then I would have had to pay so it's only fair if I still give my half. We changed the subject and I thought he forgot about the whole thing until today when in the middle of the day I saw he put in the cost of gas and tolls into the splitter app that we had.

I suspect that this is happening because he just ran out of all his spending money from his summer job, and he also currently owes me $40 total so he can't really pay me back. I've also been able to get gift cards from my parents that we used to buy things for our room, and I never tried to still charge him half the cost of these items, since I thought if we managed to get a deal on something then we both share the benefit of saved money. I have a job I work on campus for spending money so I also could really easily eat the cost of this, it's just the principle of it that bothers me. If he told me at the end of the school year that he couldn't afford to pay me back, I would happily forget about whatever he owes me, but this just feels like he's trying to rip me off.

He's always been a really honest and straightforward guy, so I'm just trying to see if I'm missing something or wrong about this. Am I the asshole if I explain again why I think this is unfair and refuse to pay half the cost of gas, or should I just drop it?

1,"AITA for expecting the girl I'm dating to offer help cleaning after I cook dinner. | We're both mid 30s, less than 6 months post divorce, and have been dating for 6 weeks. We see each other 2-3x per week and usually alternate whose house we go to. When we go to her house, we typically go out for food since she's in the process of moving so she's never cooked for me before. I've made dinner for her 4x at my place, not huge productions but I am a damn good cook so I don't mind cooking for other people.

The issue came about after dinner, she had not offered to help me clean up after we finish eating. I didn't say anything the first 3x, just chalked it up to her having a good time or wanting to play with my border collie. The 4x after I was done cleaning, I was severely annoyed that she had yet offered to help clean up after I had cooked really delicious meals for her four times. She's a really kind person, and I would never have thought she was doing this maliciously or to use me, but when I put myself in her shoes I was astonished how she thought watching me cook and then clean without offering help was ok.

A little background, I'm was raised in NC and she was raised in MN. So when I confronted her I asked if it's considered rude in MN to not offer help cleaning up after someone cooks for you. She said it's not, and that when she cooks for someone, she doesn't want anyone in the kitchen at all. Additionally, she said it shouldn't be an expectation for the guest to offer help, and if I wanted help I should have asked for it. I did view it as an expectation that the person offers to help. We discussed it for 5 minutes, chalked it up to cultural differences, and it's now water under the bridge.

1,"AITA for wanting someone to pay me after he lost a bet? | So I work at an office with around 300 others and even though there is some competition between certain people in general the work atmosphere is great. We joke around with eachother, we do group activities  and we take friendly bets.

These bets can be about anything. I bet you can't throw this piece of paper on X's desk from here for $20 or something equally benign. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. When I lose I always make it a point to instantly pay and not whine about it. Fair is fair.

3 weeks ago I made a bet with Jack. He is maybe 10 years younger than me even though he earns the same as me he is one of those guys who manages to spend his whole salary before the end of the month. No problem, we're all adults and can make our own choices. The bet we made was about blackjack. We were talking about casino games and I said did you know that the version of blackjack at a certain casino has a house edge of 0.74% to which he replied that it actually is a lot more. Time for a bet. The usual $20? Let's do it. Shake on it. Lets see who's right.

Boom, I am right. Jack asked me if he could pay later. Sure man, why not. It's only $20. All good.

A week passes by. ""Hey Jack, you still owe me that $20"". ""Yeah man, tomorrow ill get it for you, only have my cards on me now"". Queue a few weeks of excuses and 'Oh sorry I forgot's. Yesterday a group of about 9 colleagues including Jack are sitting in the bar below our our office after work and I see him pay for a $7 organic craft beer with a $20 note. ""Hey Jack, that's my $20!"" in a non confronting tone. He tells me that he doesn't owe me because the terms of the bet were not clear and that he therefor owes me nothing. I get angry and proceed telling him he is a cunt and that if he is a real man he should just bite the bullet and pay me reminding I would have paid him straight away if I would have been wrong.

At this point Becky another colleague, arguably the hottest and most popular of the group, intervenes. ""Let it go, its only $20"". ""No"", I reply. ""Jack is an asshole for not paying me"". A little back and forth ensues and the group turns against me. In the end I tell Jack that he can keep my $20, that he is a little bitch and that I hope he enjoys his beer.

0,"AITA for making a bet with my husband that caused him to give up naming rights to our child? | Bit of an odd story. I'm a Cowboys fan and my husband is an Eagles fan. We actually met tailgating at a Cowboys Eagles game back in 2010. 

Fast forward to 2018 and we found out we were pregnant. My husband and I have vastly different taste when it comes to boy names. I love classic and traditional names and he prefers names that are much more uncommon. We decided that to make a bet. If the Cowboys made it farther than the Eagles, I got naming rights. If the Eagles made it farther than the Cowboys, he got naming rights. We did something similar for our dog but that was with fantasy football. Now we have a doggo named Mcnabb. 

Both were eliminated in the divisional round. After some disagreement (the Eagles technically made it one more day but only because they played on Sunday) we decided the higher record would win. That meant I had primary naming rights. 

We had our baby about 2.5 weeks ago. I gave him a traditional name that is associated with a former Cowboys player. I posted his picture and name on Facebook for friends and family to see (I live in a different state than my family) and so many people asked how I convinced my die hard Eagles fan husband to give my son a name that was associated with a Cowboy. I told them our bet and all hell broke lose. People asked how I could make my husband give up his naming rights, his brother said I should be ashamed, and my own mom said she couldn't believe we let our son's name ride on a football season. 

My husband isn't mad about this in the slightest. In fact, he has said he wants to do it again and that he'll be naming the child Carson regardless of the gender if/when he wins.

0,"AITA for keeping the money? | So, I bought a game for my switch a while ago, and I bought it new ($60) and played it alittle, but kinda got tired of it after a while and stopped playing it. My buddy wanted to borrow it and I said sure and gave it to him.

After a couple of months I kinda got in the mood to play it again and asked him if I could get it back. He said he is sorry, but his dog chewed it up and it was destroyed. He then offered to pay me back. So no harm, no foul, he gives me sixty bucks right then and there and I stay to hang out with him for the rest of the day.

Fast forward about a week and me and him are hanging out again, going to a few stops we usually go to, to look at games or movies etc. Where I found a copy of the game for $20. So I buy it. In the car were talking and he asks me for the other $40 back. I asked him what he meant, and he told me that since the game was $20 here, that's all he should have to pay for. I tell him giving me the $60 was paying me back for the money I spent on the copy he had in the first place, and what i do with the money he gave me doesn't matter.

0,"AITA for deciding to not sell a car to a woman who didn't show up on time? | Not the most thrilling AITA story, but I am kind of feeling conflicted.

Late last year my Mother in law wanted to sell her car, so we posted it for sale on Facebook. We had a lot of people enquire, and wanting to look, but not until the next day.
Anyway, it was around 9pm and this woman asked if she paid in cash, would we sell to her for a grand less than asking price, putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that she had ""cash waiting"". I asked MiL and she said yes as the car had no battery (which was in the ad). The woman then said she could come that same night, around 10pm and pick it up, with cash. Again, MiL said yes, although not super impressed about her coming that late, but she wanted the car gone. So, we started to make sure everything was in order with the car, double checking there was nothing left inside, my husband even went to charge the battery to see if it still worked so she could test drive. Etc.

It was around 10pm by now, and this woman messages me saying that she can't come now. But that she will be there at 8am in the morning, that way she could bring a battery with her. I say, sure, but is she sure about 8am as others are interested (which is true). She says definitely 8am.

The next moring comes, and not too long before 8am, woman messages saying she will be a little late. I say okay, thinking like 10-15 minutes.

We ended up waiting an hour, and we decided after messing around the previous night, and with other potential buyers waiting, that we wouldn't be selling to her.
I messaged the woman and politely explained this, and that's where it went down hill.

Directly after this message the woman states that she is on her way, and that she just had to get the money out at the bank (although she apparently had cash waiting last night?).
I say again that we are going with another buyer, and she doesn't seem happy, saying she's just near our street, and she had to get money out, got stuck in traffic, that I'm rude, and accuses me of being offered more, and that's the only reason why I am no longer selling to her (genuinely not why, we just didn't want to wait any longer).
I calmly explain again why we went with another buyer, due to the wait, etc. and say goodluck in finding a vehicle.

Looking back, I do feel bad, as I am not usually the type to say no, or change my mind. I'm usually a complete push over, and I do what I can to be helpful. But, I was already running late for things I had planned that morning, time is valuable, and I was not in the mood for people and their shit. Others were genuinely interested like I said, too. 
I also had a gut feeling that she was going to try to get the price down even more, or that she was going to cancel again and wasn't even on her way. She just had that vibe.
I told her not to contact me anymore after she said what she needed to, and she thankfully didn't.

We ended up selling the car to a nice lady who paid only $500 less than asking price, and we bought a battery and installed it for her. So, it worked out in the end.

TL;DR:

Woman organized 2 different times to come and buy a car with cash, canceled the first time, then left us waiting an hour the second time. 
I explain we're no longer selling to her due to this, and she makes up excuses and calls me rude.

I’m not vegan, my son isn’t vegan, and nor is my grandma. However, my cousin who had dropped her kids off at my grandmas IS vegan, and so are her 3 kids, 13,12, and 5. 

My cousin usually drops her kids off at my Grams place so she can go to yoga, and normally (I think from what my grandma has mentioned) she’ll leave cash so my grandma can order them some vegan food. However today she didn’t leave any money because I’m assuming she saw me there and figured I’d take care of the bill. She’s always done stuff like that since we were young, because I have always been a saver and she’s never missed trying to take advantage of that. 

After maybe 2 hours, I decide it’s time for lunch and so ask my grams if she’s hungry cuz I’m happy to cook. She insisted I leave the cooking and order in but I’m not letting an old lady cook or waste money when there’s food in the house so I make some awesome vegan tacos (it was vegan ground beef on lettuce leaves with diced onion and sriracha mayo so really nothing fancy but pretty tasty). 

My kid ate it yelling ‘daddy this is AWESOME’, my grandma ate it and was pleasantly surprised that it was good, I ate it and even the dog was sniffing around at the ground meat. Two of her kids however sat there with their noses turned right the way up and kept saying ‘ew, I just want to order something in’ whilst the youngest chomped it down shaking his butt doing the little kid happy food dance. 

I just told the older two they could eat this or go get fruit from the kitchen. They sat there scowling until their mom came back. When she did they went running to her and told her how hungry they were, at which point she asked why I hadn’t ordered them food when ‘there’s just literally a vegan sushi bar a block away’  I told my cousin that I had cooked vegan food, and I didn’t feel the need to order in when there was already food available. 

She called me a complete asshole (in front of my son as he had wondered in by this point) and told me that if I was such a tightwad she would have squared the cash with me right from the start so her kids didn’t need to go hungry.

I’ve been staying with my grandma so I can make it to work on time and go to school too. Before I got the job I would stay home and only go down to the city when I needed to go to college, so on my free days I would stay and clean. 

Me and my stepbrother (he’s 16)  share a bathroom together and a hallway, I usually clean our area because I hate having a mess. Problem is, the 2 weeks that I wasn’t home, I arrived last night to an awful mess. There was blood in the shower (my stepbrother gets nose bleeds a lot ) stains on the toilet, a toilet that hasn’t been flushed, hair on the walls and in the tub, gum on the sink edge, hair products out of their cabinets and soap box carton next to the trash bin instead of inside of it. Hallway has candy wrappers on the floor and it’s dusty enough to cause me to sneeze. 

Angered, I called my stepmom upstairs to see the state that her son has left the bathroom. I told her since I won’t be here as much anymore that her son is going to have to pick up part of his slack (the only chores that he does is clean his room and take the garbage out)  and that he needs to clean the bathroom because I am not picking up after him. The mess wasn’t mine after all so she was understanding last night about it and told me she was going to have a talk with him. So I let it go, didn’t use the bathroom because it was nasty and went straight to sleep.

It was until this morning, that I received a message from her, in a group chat with me her and her son, to “address the situation” by leaving a long text of how we are both responsible for cleaning the bathroom and that I as the adult, he must follow along my steps blah blah blah. Point was, she was shifting the blame of how disgusting the bathroom was, on both of us. 

I didn’t leave the bathroom in that state when I left home 2 weeks ago so I feel like I shouldn’t be responsible for cleaning it. He doesn’t do much of the house chores, and barely cleans himself. He does the bare minimum in school too since he’s always skipping classes. He doesn’t have much responsibility and there for I feel like he should be the one cleaning his mess.

It upsets me that she wants to blame me as well, acting like I make as much as a mess like him, which I don’t because I never raised that way. 

My stepbrother doesn’t respect his mom and makes her do most of his chores (even after witnessing that mess, instead of making him clean it, she’s decided to do it herself). He will never take her seriously because she doesn’t punish him by grounding him and taking away privileges, he doesn’t know the consequences of his actions. 

I’m considering telling her off, because she always complains to me how she’s worried for his future and how much of a slob he is. But I feel like she’s hugely to blame because he wouldn’t be like this if it weren’t for her irresponsibility.

1,"AITA for rescinding a giveaway win because she wanted to profit off of it? | I'm the owner of a sporting/hunting goods store and for the autumn season we had a giveaway of a 5 minute shopping spree. It may not sound like much but it's a small store and you could easily rack up $5,000-10,000 in goods in that time. The winner was chosen by purchasers of the month of October: you got a number on your receipt and we drew the winning number two nights ago with the spree happening today.

The winner was announced on our Facebook page and a woman was the winner. Maybe mid-30s, I don't know if that's important. She doesn't seem like the kind of person to go hunting or whatever but looks can be deceiving, we don't judge. She posted on Facebook and it started a long comment chain between her and others, in public view of everyone else including myself and my employees, and the gist of the conversation was asking people what she should pick out to *maximize her profit selling the items on the secondary market*.

Our rules are pretty lax, so much so we didn't consider someone just picking up the most expensive things just to resell. I figured it'd give one lucky person a new kayak and some hunting gear, not someone picking up 50+ Yeti mugs. The resale market for most hunting stuff is pretty low but there's some treasures in here that could easily be flipped for easy cash. One of our rules did apply: we reserved the right to rescind the giveaway offer at any time for any reason and without compensation.

But that's all beside the point (so far), just idle conversation doesn't imply intent, but when she came in today to redeem her win, that's exactly what she did. Straight to the Yeti cups. She even asked one of my employees ""what do you think in here I could sell for the most money"".

When she got to the register, I was the one who handled her cart. And I decided to take away her win and instead hold a redraw next week for a new winner. She didn't break any rules, but I was exercising my one rule to preserve the spirit of the competition. This woman doesn't need this stuff, she wants cold hard cash. Why give her this reward when someone more deserving could get it? Someone who actually uses this stuff?

I’d like to use my college fund for this purpose or for higher education later on. Specifically, I told my brother I wanted to use the extra money to save for a car. 

My brother wants me to use my fund to pay off the rest of his college loans. He went further than that though and said it was selfish for me not to and kind of guilted me into it by saying I was just going to college for free. He further argued that wanting a car wasn’t as serious as him graduating with debt. I don’t see it this way because I sacrificed a lot to attend a military academy, if he really wanted he could have done the same if he wanted a free education and I’ll still be paying in a sense by serving five years after.

0,"AITA: Husband told me to give all earnings to him to take care of household and so I made more money | So long story short, we both came into the relationship with our own set of kids, and I came in with some debt and a business. For 12 years, I had been doing my part continuing my business (that I'd had a decade before I met him) and completed a degree ""to get a proper job"" as I was instructed. He would then quit his long life hated job to go back to school himself. Since then we've also had two babies. Note I've always made more than he did, but he also did more work around the house to keep us going (fixing car, fixing house, etc). I get what he is contributing on his part. 

5 years later, I've acquired a degree, a full time career in something else and have begun to relaunch my former business to make money to pay on the debt I wanted to cover. Currently, I'm the breadwinner and also receive passive income checks from my former business. All of this money goes to husband because he says its for my protection as I've now had debt bills threatening to garnish.

I thought we were good with the money I have been funneling to him from everything I make, but I had a chance to make a few hundred dollars for a small project. So yes - I thought I'd go pay off some of my debts. We had a car break down and have been completely replaced, so I had assumed from what I was told by husband that we had it covered, though we'd be short until my paycheck and passive income checks came in the next few days. 

He sees I have the $200 (from the side project) in my bank account and that it goes off to be paid on a debt. He's livid, telling me that I can't be doing stupid crap like this and that I'm an idiot with my money, selfish, all the fun words. This has happened before, despite that I had been in communication on what was needed, bills to be paid, etc. He told me that any side cash I make will automatically go to the family, no questions, no buts, nothing. I can't even get a second job (which I have been told I don't need anyway) without him taking all that cash. Yet, time and again for years, I'm being reminded that my debt is ruining his life and dreams, that its because I'm so irresponsible. This happens when we have arguments. Goes back to the debt and how its ruining his life. Yet he's never been able to save a dime in his life, is reckless when we have extra money, etc. It's just my fault.

0,"AITA for banning girlfriend's daughter from my house? | I'm 28, girlfriend is 27. She has a 2 year old with her ex, 28, who is in the picture. They have joint custody. I own my own house, she has an apartment, he has an apartment. We've been dating seven months.

My house is closer to the daughter's daycare than my girlfriend's apartment. So I offered to her to hang out at my place and then we'd all have dinner together a couple nights a week. Whenever the girlfriend doesn't have her daughter with her, nightly dinners are usually a thing anyways, so instead of 4 times a week, it happens every day a week. And I don't mind!

The problem is I get home from work about two hours after daycare is over. So she spends those two hours playing with her daughter in my living room, giving her a snack, etc. I'm getting tired of the snacking, because her idea of snacking is giving her a bowl of cheerios or crackers or whatever, the bowl inevitably gets toppled or spilled onto the floor within 10 seconds, and the daughter smooshes them up leaving crumbs everywhere. 

The girlfriend doesn't clean it, and I have to clean it when I get home. But sometimes I don't catch it all, especially when she decides to smoosh cookies into my couch cushions. I've started to get ants, localized in my living room. I've never had ants before, and I worry about what's next. Cockroaches? Mice?

I warned her to be more attentive of her daughter and if she makes a mess to clean it up. I even bought her some bowls that suction cup to my coffee table so it at least prevents some mess, but she doesn't use them and doesn't clean up. I told her the nuclear option is coming: no more daughter at my house until she's capable of being cleaner, and the girlfriend says I'm punishing the child for something she can't control.

I'm not punishing the daughter, I'm punishing my girlfriend. If she won't clean up the mess her daughter makes, then I don't want an opportunity for the mess to occur. The daughter isn't the issue, the girlfriend is the issue, by not cleaning up or being attentive enough.

Well, it happened. I banned the daughter from coming here after daycare. This puts pressure on my girlfriend because if she wants to have a dinner with the three of us here, she needs to travel 40min home, wait until I get home, and then another 40min here. This isn't only time, but money. She called me an asshole for ""making the life of a single mom harder"" but she dug her own grave.

0,"AITA for not being around to meet my neighbors, after moving into a new house? | 
I just bought my first house, in a neighborhood near my work. I'm also not really the type to be much of a homebody; I have a busy job and a busy social life.

2 weeks ago, Monday, was move-in day; I started after work and finished by midnight that same day, with some help from my boyfriend and friends. I didn't have a whole lot to move and I was done quick. 

Tuesday and Wednesday, I stayed at my boyfriend's apartment because the internet wasn't set up at my place. Thursday, I worked a long day then went out for drinks with my coworkers, and came home around midnight. Friday, I worked, then went straight out of town for the weekend to visit friends. I was back in town Monday for work, but each night that week I had stuff going on; a concert, time with friends, sports, date night with my boyfriend.

Over this time, I had a couple contractors come by to do work outside. One group to haul junk away because the old owners had left a rickety playset and torn trampoline. And one group to tear down the old shed that was rotting away in the yard; and replace it with a sand base for a fire pit. And one guy to patch up the cracked driveway. I wasn't home then; they usually came during 9-5 work hours. 

This weekend, I finally had time to start unpacking properly. That Sunday; I was out doing general yard stuff; setting up the fire pit, and some of my neighbors came by. They seemed kind of prickly from the start; making little snips about how ""there isn't a ghost in the house, after all"" and I tried to joke around by saying that the only wailing they'd hear was me trying to sing in the shower. That joke fell flat. They told me after that, that it was awfully rude of myself to not introduce myself for weeks, not tell them or any of the neighbors that I was having contractors over, not being available to supervise the people I'd hired.

I asked if there were any problems; had the workers done something? And they complained about them parking in the street, smoking while they worked, and just having strange men coming and going through the backyard next to where their children play.

I felt like they were overreacting, but I said sorry it had been a bother.

But then later that day, another neighbor, a mom from nearby, came over and asked where the play set had gone. Apparently the kids used to play there, and she would have wanted to buy it, if I'd been around. I said i hasn't known, and id had it taken away. She seemed annoyed and asked where I'd been. I said work, and with my friends and boyfriend, and out of town for a bit too. And she made a comment about how I must have a very busy schedule, if I can't even find time to introduce myself around town.

This is so different than everywhere I've lived before, where people kept to them themselves.

I said if he choose a less expensive laptop I would pay for it. He kept saying that he needed that specific MacBook Pro. I disagreed and returned the laptop.

When I moved in, I parked in the driveway. Then my neighbor got a car and we had to share the driveway. 

The problem is since the driveways are one car width, someone gets blocked in. I leave for work or to drop my girlfriend off at work every single day at 2:00-2:30 am. Because of that, we go to bed around 5-6 pm the night before. If I park in the driveway, I get blocked in by my neighbor who comes home around 10pm.

0,"AITA if I call the police on my older brother to get possession of my car back? | I financed a car back in 2014 when I had a steady income. Absolute beauty of a car, 2014 Chevrolet Impala, silver, looks brand new. However, I had to drop out of college for severe mental issues. In turn I lost the $1800 stipend I used to get from my scholarship. As a result, I could no longer afford to pay the monthly car payment.

About 4 months ago my brother got a job. He doesn't have a car so I let him use mine in the meanwhile. He's been using it for a while but when I ask him for it on the days I have appointments, he makes up excuses as to why he needs it more than I do, like for example how my grandma's van wastes more gas (which it doesn't, I've checked). We got into multiple fights and during one of those fights he claimed that since my ""bum ass"" can't pay for the car anymore, it's no longer my car but the ""family car"" instead. I thought that was complete and utter bullshit because at first he said it was ""mom's car"" because she was paying for it. Then my mom took my side and he switched excuses. He refuses to give it back to me and always fights with me and my mom over it. I've gotten advice from my therapist and cousins to just call the police since the car is my name and they'll return the keys to me.

0,"AITA for using reward/loyalty points to pay for my portion of delivery pizza at a casual gathering with friends? | I (a 35 year old male) was hanging out with a couple buddies of similar demographic (important later). Just a completely casual Saturday afternoon with the wives away shopping and us just chilling on the patio sipping on the beers from my fridge. At one point a friend suggests we all go in on some pizza, and we all enthusiastically agree. We order 3 pies from a local chain, approximately ~$10 per pie (including delivery fees) for about $30 total.

As it's my home, I pull out my phone and place the order using the restaurant's mobile app, and I realize at this time that I have enough reward points in my account to cover the cost of one of the pizzas, bringing our new total to around $20. So of course I apply the reward points (which to be fair, I didn't mention to my friends as it didn't seem important), and when the pizza arrives I tip the driver $6 (I've delivered food before, I always tip around 20% of the total cost regardless of coupons and discounts, so I tipped 20% of the original $30 cost).

I tell my two friends ""$10 each, $12 if you want to cover part of the tip."" They both happily agree to $12 and we enjoy our pizza and beers in peace.

The trouble begins at the end of the night when the wives come home and give us a knowing grin and eye-roll about how ""Of course you boys just drank beers and had a pizza party wink wink you're so predictable."" One of my buddies tells his wife (jokingly) it's cheaper than their shopping outings, and she runs to the kitchen to grab the receipt. They notice the total was only $20 and start giving me grief about essentially ""fleecing"" them on the cost. I explained that I had reward points built up with that particular chain and that it was either pay $10 cash or use $10 worth of my reward points, so what's the difference?

They got upset claiming I should have passed the savings along to the group where we all ended up paying for the $20 total and tip split three ways instead of the $30 plus tip. As I mentioned earlier, we're all approximately 35 year old men who have all had salaried careers for close to a decade, and we're fortunate that a $10 expense is not really something to worry about. So I was a little surprised to receive so much flak, and even went as far as to say ""If you really feel I was trying to trick you so I didn't have to pay, I'll happily pick up the whole tab."" They seemed to take that as an admission of guilt. Oops.

I also deal with numbers daily at my job so in my head I'm thinking ""Ok... $36 split 3 ways is $12 a head, $26 split 3 ways is about $9 a head... do they really think I'm trying to cheat them out of a difference of $3 per person? Especially after we just spent a great afternoon together and we drank around $40 of my beer with no worries?""

I work part time as a ride operator at a theme park centered around plastic brick toys (since I’m a full time student), and while I don’t make nearly enough to be able to move out on this salary, I’m putting nearly all of it away into savings so I can move out. My parents have always been very overbearing, going so far as to demand access to my bank account so they can “monitor my spending”. When I first opened my current account at 18, I asked the banker if they would be able to take money out of my account, and she assured me that they would only be able to put money in.

Fast forward to today. I was helping my mom with laundry, and my dad brought up the stimulus check that he just received, and how he’s using it to pay off bills due this month. I made a comment about how it’s good that we’re going to be able to pay this month, because of reduced income. Then he hits me with the bombshell.

Me: .......what?

Dad: I said you shouldn’t touch it. Not that I wouldn’t. Besides, if you want to keep driving that car, and using that phone, you’ll have to just let me take it.

I got upset by this and refused to continue the conversation. While it’s true that my parents bought me the car, my dad did tell me that I would only be allowed to keep it if I kept living with them, and went to college for what they wanted.

I've been friends with Tony for some years now. We're part of a larger friend group which has regular get-togethers, just to hang out and chat, sometimes at restaurants and pubs and sometimes at someone's home.

About half a year back, Tony went on a keto diet; that's a diet where one eats protein and fats, but zero (or close to zero) carbs. And it's been really good to him: he lost lots of weight, and he looks amazing now. But he's become absolutely insufferable. Whenever someone in the friend group complains about something health-related within earshot of Tony, he says ""Have you tried going on keto?"" and then launches into a half-hour (at minimum) spiel about it. He completely dominates the conversation, and it's impossible to stop him. We tried telling him he was getting annoying, but he keeps doing it anyway.

Whenever we have our get-togethers, he constantly complains about the food. No restaurant is good enough for him, they always get a tiny detail off from his order and he sends the food back, over and over (his record is five times). The only good place is Burger King. He orders two double cheeseburgers, hold the bun. But me and the rest of our friends (a dozen people total) don't want to always eat at Burger King.

And when we meet at someone's home and do a potluck-style dinner, he would always complain that nothing we make is good enough for him, despite us going out of our way to satisfy his requirements: there's always at least one carb-less dish available, usually two or three. (He doesn't cook, so he never brings anything to the potluck dinners.) Some of our group even stopped coming to our get-togethers because he would be there.

The straw that broke the camel's back came two weeks ago. We met at a friend's home; I'd made steak sandwiches to share. I put the food down on the kitchen table, then went milling around, chatting, and so on. Then I notice Tony has a plate full of what looks like meat, and I'm perplexed since I didn't remember there being a plate of meat on the table. So I ask him where he got the meat.

He got it from my sandwiches. He went through the whole plate did it to each sandwich, taking the meat and leaving just slightly soggy bread (from the sauce) for everyone else. When I asked if he didn't consider that someone else might want to try a sandwich he replied, ""Well yes but I don't eat carbs, while y'all do, so this seems like a fair division."" (There were other carb-less dishes on the table, but he apparently didn't like them.)

That was too much. I stormed out, and when I got home I started a new group chat with all the friend group except him, and the next two times we met without him. Much more enjoyable.

But now Tony is going around telling people that we're discriminating against him because of his diet.

0,"AITA for this boat sale? | So we recently sold our boat that we had been living on for two years, sold it for $16,500. The buyer (call him Dan) said he could come up with $15,000 and pay me the rest at the end of the month (Boat was sold Aug 15th). I said that would be fine, but asked if we could still stay until the end of the month, to which he agreed.

The boat is docked at a covered marina, with a monthly rent ($450). In order to transfer the slip into Dans name, he’s have to present registration and insurance. I told him this repeatedly, before and after he bought the boat. I did not want to pay for moorage on a boat I don’t own. He said it wouldn’t be a problem. He did ask how much registration and insurance would be. I told him what I paid, which was next to nothing, and who my insurer was. He said no problem and he’d get right on it.

One week after the sale, Dan called to inform me that the registration was going to be way higher ($1,500). I felt terrible and apologized profusely. I told him that since that was unexpected that we could deal with the $1500 he owed me whenever. He appreciated that and said it was really no problem, just surprising.

Fast forward until the final day of the month. Dan had still not registered nor insured the boat that is now legally released from my name (with docs to prove it). If he doesn’t get it done that day, I’m on the hook for his moorage. He calls me to tell me that I misled him. He couldn’t get insurance because the company I had used didn’t like his lack of boating experience. He said I knew about that requirement and should have warned him of it. He also was still angry from paying a high registration fee and felt he was misled and that I tricked him into buying something he couldn’t afford.

He had been in possession of the boat for 18 days at this point, and we even moved out early because he alluded to the fact he was homeless and needed it. 

The marina has said they can cut me from my lease, but that means he’ll be towed out from the slip. I’d feel terrible if that happened but I feel as if he simply didn’t do his due diligence.

1,"AITA being petty and taking back the jewelry I got my girlfriend | Been lead to believe what I have done is 100% assholeish by my friends. But I think the context makes it acceptable. So I'm asking here to decide whether I should be the bigger person.

My (now ex-) girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 years. Over this time I've gotten her jewelry for her birthday/christmas/basically any present. I actually dislike giving jewelry as a gift as it's kind of cliche, but it's what she always wanted, so whatever I did it to keep her happy.

Fast-forward to last month I catch my girlfriend having an emotional ""affair"". I put that in quotes as I have no evidence she physically cheated on me so I guess affair isn't the right word, but she's been talking to some guy for at least 3 months flirting and they even exchanged ""love yous"" and ""miss yous"" etc. She denies cheating on me, but idk what the fuck she's doing texting a guy like that behind my back if cheating isn't her intention.

Anyway, I'm not trying to make this into a relationship post, I just think the context is important. So I give her a month to move out of my house. Eventually all her stuff is packed up in boxes (she's now at her parents house) and I'm waiting for her dad/brother to come pick it all up. At this point I decide to take back all the jewelry I got her since:

1. Try to claw back some of my losses

2. I got her it in the context of a monogamous relationship. She violated that and hence I think it's fair game to take it backk

3. If I'm being honest I'm also doing it to be petty

So I go through the boxes until I find her jewelry boxes. **Important: I only take back jewelry I got her. I didn't take back anything I didn't buy her.** I then return the jewelry boxes like nothing happened.

Eventually she realises and starts asking questions. I  deny everything since there's no way she can prove I took anything. It's all currently sitting in a box in my attic.

So with the context AITA?

1,"AITA for asking my (unemployed) step-daughter to cook as part of her chores? | Disclaimer: my gf and I aren’t married, but the relationship is more step-daughterish because the daughter is being supported by us.

I moved into my girlfriend’s apartment last summer right before her daughter left for college. She’s recently moved back into our apartment since the dorms at her school closed and says she has to take her classes online. It’s a two bedroom apartment with me (35M) my gf (40F), her daughter (20F), and her son (17M). The son spends most of his time at his girlfriend’s house and is rarely here, so the daughter has been staying in his room.

My gf and I have opposite work schedules. She works 3pm-11pm and I work 4am-12pm. The daughter is currently not working, and whenever I’m up and around the house, it never seems like she’s ever busy. She’s always just on her laptop or phone. I’ve noticed that she usually cooks for her mom when she gets home from work because there are always pans on the drying rack and leftovers in the fridge when I get up in the morning.

My reasoning is that I live here too and I even pay one third of the rent to help her mom out even though there are four people living here. I work 40 hours a week and she just stays home all day. It couldn’t hurt her to throw something together or throw something in the oven, so I have something to eat when I get home and aren’t forced to just snack on their leftovers or just eat canned soup everyday for Christ’s sake.

She seemed surprised at first when I asked her and gave my reasons, then got moody about it. She kept giving excuses like she only cooks for her mom because she eats around the same time she gets home. I told her the easy solution to that would be to also eat around the time I get home. People eat more than one meal a day. When I was living at my sister’s (30F) house before moving here, she would work 40 hours a week AND cook for us, so I told her since she isn’t even making money and contributing to the household, the least she could do is cook as part of her chores.

A little more about the chore, I do my fair share. We had sat down when she moved back in and divided chores up in between the four of us, so it would be even. Since she willingly offered to take on most of the kitchen for her chores, I had figured that it would include cooking. Just to add, whenever her brother comes by the house, she always offers to cook with him, but she’s never shown the same courtesy to me. I’m the only one in the apartment that’s being excluded from this.

It makes me not even feel welcomed here even though even though it would be such a simple task for her. AITA for asking my gf’s daughter to help contribute more in the house?",False,False,2,4,3,3,1,4,Fairness|Proportionality

Recently I went back to the UK with my husband for a few weeks to visit family. While we were there we went out to a restaurant, not a super fancy one but it was nice enough. In the UK you never really leave a tip at a restaurant, it can be seen as rude and usually won't even go to the waiter/waitress, it will just be given to the restaurant. My husband only really knows the american way of tipping so left a £10 note as a tip. I told him not to and explained the reasons but he said it was only fair to. He left it on the table as we were leaving but I turned around to pick it up without telling him.

0,"AITA for lying about how I got a prominent scar? | Obligatory 'on mobile' warning. 

So some backstory- I (19F) have a very obvious clusters of scars on my throat from an incident when I was younger. I normally do whatever I can to hide it (ie. wearing turtlenecks or lots of necklaces and chokers) but sometimes it's not possible or I forget about it.

Normally, people stare a bit but don't ask questions but occasionally, someone will ask what happened/ if I'm okay. I normally just give a kinda vague 'Oh I had a surgery when I was younger'-type answer and change the conversation and people will generally leave it.

The incident- I was at my friend's(21F) house and her granddad asked me what the scars were from. I told him my usual surgery answer and he didn't ask anymore questions. My friend didn't say anything at the time either. She does know what the scar is actually from as we've been friends for about six years. I forgot about it until last night, when I got a text where she was basically berating me for lying about it and saying I was being disrespectful to throat cancer survivors and I shouldn't be ashamed of what happened and it was dishonest and by lying about what the scars are from, I'm adding to the stigma that people with mental health problems are liars/ attention seekers and so on. I have /never/ said my scars were in anyway related to throat cancer or cancer of ANY kind so I honestly have no clue where that comment came from. 

I think I was probably an AH in my reply but I basically just told her to fuck off and that it's my choice and that it's easy for her to say that I shouldn't be ashamed when she's not in my situation. She's read my message and not replied.

My friend and I were both overweight, me just a bit and him probably 50+ lbs. We both decided we wanted to look better so we joined a gym and had our mutual personal trainer friend make us a meal plan. 

We went to the gym together, but he never really put in a real effort. He'd lie about how many reps he did if he thought I wasn't paying attention or he'd make excuses about why he couldn't go today. It's his life and I didn't care because I was enjoying the gym anyways.

0,"AITA for asking a neighbour to stop her clients from parking in my space? | So there’s a woman who lives a few doors down from me that has been running a tutoring business from her house for years. Many of the parents of the kids she tutors will sit in their cars and wait while their kids are being taught, sometimes for up to an hour. As long as I can remember we and many of our neighbours have always had people parking in our private spaces right outside our back gates (so it’s fairly obvious it belongs to the resident) but they have always been happy to move when asked politely and generally apologetic. 

However for the past couple of weeks there had been one lady in particular who regularly parks in my space, unfortunately at the time I return home from work. My mother had previously explained to her that all of the parking spaces in that car park were privately owned and asked her to move which she eventually did after being quite rude to my mum. Tonight though when I came home from a long bank holiday spent at work I found that this woman was again parked in my space. I politely asked her to move and she began shouting and swearing at me from her car. She insisted she didn’t know they were private spaces and that there were no clear signs to say that car park is private (there are 3, one just a meter to the left of where she was parked). It got to the point where my neighbour came outside to check I was ok as the woman was shouting abuse THAT loud that he heard it from inside his house. She told me that she was there to pick up her 4 year old son and he would not be able to walk to extra 50m or so to the ‘non-residents’ parking bays. I knew this was a lie as I’ve seen her son twice before and he is at least 16. The situation ended with the woman throwing a bunch of rubbish out of her window at my feet and then leaving completely (without her son).

The tutor got quite defensive and said that she could not control what the parents did. I explained that I understood that and that I was not blaming her but she said it had nothing to do with her and that maybe I “shouldn’t be so sensitive” before shutting the door in my face.

1,"AITA for saying ""See you next year"" to a teacher who is getting let go? | So this teacher (I will call him R) was new at my school this year. 

Immediately he tried to impose his own way of teaching and grading on us (the students) which was very different that anything we had ever experienced. You were expected to do things his way, and even if his was was wrong, which people pointed out to him, you were still expected to use it. R also took points off for scratch work that he didn't like, and tried to take off as many points as possible on the tests, quizzes, and homeworks. Every student he had with no exception was subjuct to this.

R also took forever to grade our assignments. We took a test the week before spring break, and got it back ~6 weeks later. He also refused to go over it with anyone. R never offered help outside of the classroom and was hostile whenever asked for extra help.

The administration took notice and we were informed that R was not coming back next year. Needless to say, we were overjoyed about this. Since the announcement, R completely checked out, he just wrote notes on the board, barely talked during class,and went to Disneyland instead of going to one of the review days for exams.

Yesterday, as I was walking out Of R's classroom for the last time, I called ""See you next year!"" over my shoulder. My friends have told me that I'm the asshole for this, but I don't think so.

0,"AITA for not giving my college roommate free rides back home because of a lease ""benefit"" I received? | At the beginning of the year, we both signed a lease to get a nice apartment right off-campus.  When we went in to sign the lease, they had a deal going on in which we were able to choose between 50% off a parking spot or a free Nintendo Switch. Since my roommate and I do not have time for video games, he told me he was cool with me getting the 50% off parking since I am the only one that owns a car. I have a car on campus as it is helpful for getting groceries and I like to go back home at least once a month. 

I usually give him rides back home as our hometowns are very near each other and we typically split the gas. I usually charge him around $30 for a round trip back home that is three hours away. I never charge him for gas when we go grocery shopping or cruise around town.  Out of nowhere, he has been subtly bringing up the fact that he deserves at least 3-4 free rides back home because he received ""no benefit"" out of signing the lease. Right off the bat, I said no because I still had to pay for the parking spot and there are much more expenses that go into my car other than just the gas. I truly believe he is getting a benefit out of this as he is paying much less for a round trip to home compared to taking the bus or the train. He keeps bringing up the fact that he got ""no benefit"" out of the deal at least once a week since we started school this semester and he has been making me feel as if I am in the wrong for this. He has now even said that I owe *him* half of what I paid for the parking spot. My philosophy is that if he truly had an issue with this he should have brought it up at the time we signed the apartment lease.

Sarah and I treat each other like roommates and we get along, but we don't see each other as sisters. Maybe someday we will, but we don't now. We don't feel like doing family bonding activities, like we'll do the same thing if that's what we both feel like doing that, but we don't take any time specifically to spend together.

Another big issue is with each other's extended families. Sarah and I preferred to keep our extended families as our own. This used to be okay, but lately our parents have been saying things that we're all one family, and we should love both extended families, but Sarah and I disagree. We just don't see each other's extended families as part of our own family. I have more options than Sarah because I can sometimes go to my dad's house when everyone else is planning to see John and Sarah's family, but Sarah doesn't have anywhere else to go, so she's often forced to see my family. The last time this happened I felt bad for her because she wasn't allowed to go to her friend's party because we had to go to my grandma's birthday. I stood up for her and said that it wasn't fair for Sarah to miss things with her friends when it wasn't even a party for her grandma. John yelled at me that my grandma was Sarah's Grandma too, even though Sarah doesn't think of her that way, and my mom started crying.

My eldest Jack is the most ''successful'' of our three. I don't have a favorite child of course, but I am the most proud of him. He's going to make our family proud because of what he's done. Not only is he going to graduate from an Ivy League school but he's got an internship lined up with a prestigious firm. He's extremely confident, social and also good looking so it's not a surprise he's popular with ladies. 

He hasn't been the type for relationships but he got into one with a girl we can call Danielle about 6 months ago. He hasn't brought her to the house, they mostly stay at uni together and he doesn't want her to visit. It's clear he's not taking it seriously as she seems to be way more into him than he is her. Anyway, he came to visit recently and left his phone unlocked. 

My youngest saw that and instantly checked his phone and found lots of messages/nudes sent from other girls. He's clearly cheated which is confirmed by the multiple texts to other girls. He showed Anna and then me. I took a look, and didn't like what I saw. I decided to also tell my husband and he flat out said ''Don't bother me with this shit I have more important things to do'' (which to his credit, is true. He works close to 80 hours a week. Yes we are very well financially but it's largely due to him/his connections at a prestigious firm). 

Anna and Mike were disgusted and demanded that I punish Jack. They confronted Jack and he told them to ''Fuck off''. I had a word with Jack and told him this behavior isn't good, but that's about as far as I will involve myself. I'm incredibly proud of my son for doing what he's done and told him that although I don't condone his behavior, I still love him and if he needs anything that he can always ask me. So we hugged and then I dropped him off to see his friends.

Now my other two are angry at me and Anna said that I'm condoning misogyny. I said it's not like that. I took them aside and calmly explained to them that they need to focus on their lives, because quite frankly, I don't like their career choices. Anna wants to study some sort of Sociology degree and Mike wants to become a YouTuber. I told them that they I'll take them seriously once they start taking themselves seriously like Jack and now they called me every name under the sun. Well I told my husband and now he's super pissed at them and is going to have a stern word with them.

Background: I am engaged to be married in August. My fiancé's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. 

Apparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fiancé apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fiancé was like ""aren't you so happy?""

I told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams.

My roommate's boyfriend likes to come over while she's sleeping and cuddle with her while she's asleep. She knows it, she's fine with it, it's happened before. She thinks it's romantic.

0,"WIBTA if I attend full-time law school without my family's consent? | To preface, I have two siblings: ""A""(27) and ""M""(28). I turned 30 this year. Back in 2015 my mother passed from cancer, leaving her home and her assets to ""A"" and I. I had graduated from university but “A” had never attended post-secondary. With no real work experience and a Bachelors degree that was practically useless I dropped my dream of law school and went back to school briefly while working whenever possible to ensure that bills were paid. “A” obtained part-time work. I transferred the all the bills into my name. Eventually, I graduated and obtained a full-time position with benefits and enough income to survive but not much else. ""A"" has a healthy bank account because his inheritance has barely been touched and while he's offered to transfer some bills into his name, no effort has really been made on either of our parts. 

Around 2017 my father came back into my life. We have a good relationship. He wants to see me go to law school but he would like ""A"" and I to keep our current house because housing market. I get it but I’m not particularly attached to living in a house. The maintenance is another of my responsibilities. ""A"" does some household cleaning but nothing when it comes to repairing, doing extensive cleaning, or any other things that need to get done around the house. Further, ""A"" will never be able to afford to buy out my half and I’m uninterested in the house.

It has been several years now since our mother passed and I feel I've done my part in giving “A” opportunities. I've put aside much of my life/interests for years. But life is hitting me hard. I work, I struggle to pay the bills, I drive ""A"" to and from his retail job most days and work overtime as my job requires me to travel frequently all across southern Ontario.

In my spare time, I have been studying for the LSAT which I never wrote prior to 2019.

Our father wants me to attend part-time while continuing to work my full-time job. This would commit me to maintaining the house, the bills, working full-time, doing law school part-time and continuing to give ""A,"" who can't drive, rides to and from work as well as performing any chores requiring driving (groceries, etc.) and graduating later. I think it’s unrealistic. 

Another of my father's arguments is I’ll leave “A” high and dry if we sell the house and split the value 50/50 (roughly $350,000 each). I think it's perfectly fair as, (a) ""A"" is not my kid, (b) I've given ""A"" years to pursue something but he hasn't, and (c) I have to take my own interests into consideration. All of this has been discussed with “A” and my father.

In addition, my paternal grandmother is the Landlord of a small complex in the downtown core which my father runs and he and “M” live. “A” could also come with me.

I feel like the best choice for me is to commit and take law school full-time. I know my father (possibly “A”) will never approve but I think I have to do what is best for me in this case.

0,"AITA for not allowing my working cousin to use my expensive skin care items (I am unemployed) | AITA if I prevent my working cousin from using my expensive body care products (I am unemployed)

So I got into an altercation with my cousin that I live with recently.

I am a senior in university and am taking 6 courses this semester (this is considered an overfilled semester at this school), and as such I didn’t bother getting a job this semester because I thought the workload would be too much for me with a job. My parents supported this, as i work a summer job to pay off all of my tuition and they understand if I deem my workload too stressful to take on a job with it, and they don’t push me.
All of the money I have is currently reserves from the summer job and I need to be frugal with it in order to survive until I’m able to get a job again to support my lifestyle.
My cousin works 2 jobs but doesn’t get a lot of hours for each job. My parents have a strict rule that if you are living in this house rent free you should either be working or going to school or else there will be consequences because they don’t want to raise a mooch. Whenever she gets paid she wastes her money on things from amazon she doesn’t really need and orders in food a lot. She once told me she was envious of me for having skincare routines and wanted to know how she could take care of her skin better but she had “no money.” I went through the trouble of drawing her out an affordable skincare routine but she didn’t end up taking it.
When the items are bought by my parents, I share them her. When there are products that I buy for myself, I want them to last. As such, I keep these products in my room and only use them when I am showering and wish to use them. I’ll let her use things sometimes, but other times I’m firm in telling her these are my items I buy for myself, and that she has a job and can afford to buy herself things. If I had a job I would have less of an issue with her using my things but since I am unemployed I can’t let her deplete my resources. If I leave my stuff in the shower for me to use she will help herself to them so I have to keep my stuff in my room. She gets mad at me for not sharing MY items that I buy with my own money, and that she’d have no issues with sharing with me, but that is in part BS because though she shares sometimes, when it came to her expensive items she’d refuse me. My mom agrees with me, she said that my cousin should be affording her own necessities instead of relying on my mom and I to pay for things for her. 
I think I’d even have less of a problem with helping her if I didn’t know for a fact she spends the majority of her money on bullshit she doesn’t need, so she could damn well afford to buy necessities for herself. 
She always uses the excuse “but we’re family and family should share thingssss. Plus I won’t know if I like a product enough for myself if I don’t sample from someone else first.”

1,"AITA for requesting the opportunity for my child to redo a failed assignment? | 
My son attends a small rural school. They don’t have the technology other larger schools have, so the teachers are sending home packets of work that have to returned on a weekly basis. My son is in second grade. He failed three assignments in a row. In the past, students have been able to redo assignments if they failed them. 

I sent an email asking if students could redo failed assignments and the graded assignments be returned today.


The response from the teacher was:


*The math homework page 13-3 will be in his packet today. The other two math pages will go home next week. I go up to the school once a week to trade out the papers I have graded and pick up the new packets to grade. At this time, students will not be allowed to correct any papers for a change of grade. As for which assignments will be counted for a grade, I sent a note home last week, as well as posted a copy to my webpage, but I will attach it again to this email in case it was misplaced. I am only grading the reading test and the two math homework pages. All other assignments are optional (vocabulary and grammar/ phonics pages, math guided and independent practice, daily geography packet, and weekly reader pages).*

This is where I may have been the AH, my response to her email:


*I would like to know why previously students were allowed to correct failing grades but will not be allowed to now. Students are at a significant disadvantage, more so now than previously when they were allowed to correct failing grades.*

*Furthermore, a district alert was sent on March 20, 2020 that stated, “Assigned coursework will be graded as normal by the teachers each week with a ‘Help, Do Not Hurt Approach’.”*

*Given the issue we had with the chart assignment and your approach to failing assignments, it doesn’t appear you are approaching this difficult situation with a “help, do not hurt” approach. Also considering students are at the disadvantage of not having in class instruction, would it not be beneficial to encourage the students to revisit assignments where it is clear they did not understand the content?* 

*District alerts also state homework will be returned the next week, not two weeks later. As it pertains to math, it is imperative to have returned homework as soon as possible. Math builds on previous concepts. If there is a delay in receiving that feedback, it puts your students further behind because they don’t know which concepts they have mastered and which they haven’t. Therefore, it’s likely they will continue to make similar mistakes until they receive feedback, which you are delaying.*

*According to a district alert received on March 30, 2020 from (principal) “The teachers will be grading the work this week and posting the grades in the Gradebook, then returning the graded assignments with next week’s assignments.” *

*I don’t quite understand why the procedure laid out in the district alert isn’t being followed.*",False,False,3,4,1,3,1,3,Fairness
1,"AITA for asking my vegetarian sister if I could put chicken and real cheese in 1/2 the enchiladas she was making? | Maybe I shouldn't have asked? But I think her reaction was over the top.

My little sister is the only vegetarian in the family. She also uses vegan cheese and dairy products tho because she's lactose intolerant; she mostly cooks just for herself but sometimes makes something for us all. 

This weekend she was making sweet potato and bean enchiladas for her and my mom, my dad was cooking him and I something else.

I liked the sound of enchiladas better, so I asked my sister if I could have some, and if she would put meat and real cheese in half of them if I cooked up the chicken.

She looked at me in absolute shock and said no. There was nothing wrong with her vegan/vegetarian enchiladas and she wanted to eat the leftovers which she couldn't do if there was meat in some of them. 

I asked her if I could just have a couple enchiladas with real cheese and chicken on the side and she said no. She said they were in no way meant for me, they were just for her and mom and I should just eat what dad was making. She said the enchiladas were a decent amount of work and if I ate some, I'd 'eat too many' and she'd just have to cook again tomorrow.

I told her she was being selfish for refusing to let  me have any. And she said she didn't care if she was, she was the one cooking.

I greet them and turn back to the dude next to me. Sometimes the girl asks me something and I slowly join their conversation, I thought everything was cool.

When the girl left for the bathroom, the guy she was with turned to me and asked what I was doing. I asked him what he thought I was doing, and he said that he was on a date with the girl and that I was getting in the way. I told him I wasn't doing it on purpose, but that I would leave them alone. So I go back to talking with this drunk fuck next to me. 

After maybe 15 minutes the dude leaves for the bathroom, and the girl immediately turns around and starts talking to me. She was being incredibly flirty. I'm talking going out of her way to touch me for whatever reason, laughing at everything I say and making strong eye contact. I noticed that she was really attractive and our conversation went smooth, and when the guy came back she was barely paying any attention to him.

To keep it short, she started blatantly hitting on me, and she ended up coming home with me and we slept together. Initially I felt bad for the dude but she clearly made a choice, and I gladly accepted it. I don't feel like I did anything wrong. Am I the asshole in this situation?

1,"AITA for not attending family therapy? | My ex wife is extremely dramatic, overbearing and manipulative. She loves to have her way. She has primary custody of our 7 year old who she is convinced needs a therapist because he has been acting out in school. So she enrolled him with one who also does family therapy. 

That therapist has since diagnosed him with anxiety. 

I keep getting invites from my ex to go to their family therapy sessions. He does his own individually once a week. Family is once a month. I am refusing to go. One because the times are always super inconvenient.
They meet at his school (this is a school based therapy so he doesn’t miss school). Two because my wife is convinced that my lack of a good relationship with him is part of the issue. 

Together they have apparently and my son has separately told the therapist that I say mean things to him (I just don’t baby him) and that I never see him (not true). I admit I could spend more time with him but being able to always be there is hard. I make it when I can and I communicate with him when I can’t. 

A year ago she was feeling overwhelmed  after a “medical thing” (she claimed she almost died from cancer but it was really a simple surgery) and cried to me about taking him for a while. I couldn’t. She threatened to drop him off at my parents and run away.  She has since claimed to have worked through it with her own therapist and talked through it with our son apologizing for “mommy having a tough time”. 

I asked the therapist on the phone if my son talked about me and she said “Yes, sometimes” Then she asked me to come in for the next session but I was working that day. 


I think a huge issue is her having tried to abandon him and generally just being who she is which is an awful person and my son picks up on that. 

I have told her flat out I am not going to those appointments. I have ignored the emails from the therapist. 

I am walking into a room already primed to consider me at fault and I don’t think I need to be there for that. Why? So she can say “see who agrees with me” and be smug about it. 

She said she talked to a lawyer and she could take it to court to get it ordered and I told her to go ahead but I will fight to choose the therapist, not someone already on her side. I am sure she has bought all my exes lies and my son’s exaggerations that are fed and created by my ex.

On the flip side they helped and have paid about $2000 for my sisters $11000 loan so she could go to a nicer school cause she “didn’t want to go to the same school as me”, I’m not kidding.

My sister dropped out of school halfway through her freshman year and now wants to start again, at the same community college I went to.

I get it schools hard, I dropped out too my sophomore year cause I couldn’t afford it. I’ve been saving since to start school again because I’ve always tried to pay my own way because my parents rarely offer to help me. I lost all my savings due to being unemployed for a few months and now my intended start date has been pushed back at least 6 months if not a year. When I was in school there was another point that I lost my job and had to ask my parents to help me pay my tuition and told them I would pay them back immediately. They agreed and paid about $800 for me, which I then paid $300 back and they told me the rest was a gift so I did not have to pay it back to them. That was the extent of the help I received in community college, not once since then have they offered to help me pay for school in anyway.

My sister on the other hand can afford to pay for herself and has been able to for a while, but she wastes her money on ordering clothes and getting $70-80 acrylic nails every other week. 

At the community college where I went, and where my sister wants to start, it’s only about $1200 a quarter. She doesn’t have anything saved, she still has a $9000 loan to pay off, but she should be perfectly fine to pay for school entirely if she budgets correctly.

CB = Careless Babysitter

So, We're staying at FFs house because their wedding is tomorrow, and we've been here for about 5 days. FFs have 3 kids, who are extremely misbehaved and they're a lot to handle. I'm also sick, so that adds even more difficulty to the situation.

For the majority of the time I've been here, I've been babysitting the three kids and my siblings by myself while FFs and my parents prepare for the wedding.The kids as I said are very misbehaved, and they prompt the other two to act up as well. They scream, argue, cry, and generally don't listen to me when I tell them to do anything. FFs have a gym set that they're not allowed to climb on, and because they don't listen when I tell them to get off, I have to run back and forth to actually pick them up off the equipment. They get my brother, who has ADHD riled up as well, and then my brother encourages my sister to join in, so I end up having to control five misbehaving children who don't listen to me whatsoever.

When FFs came home I explained the situation to them and they said that they would get another babysitter to help me out with the kids when they go out for dinner. I was incredibly thankful. They went out for dinner and CB showed up. The first thing she did was drop her bag in the middle of the living room and sit down on her phone. The kids were going wild as always but this time it was literally happening all around her and she was doing nothing to stop it. This carried on the entire night, and not once did she step in to help. She actually found out that I was sick around halfway through the night because she came upstairs to use the bathroom while I was up there vomiting. I kinda hoped she would start helping me after seeing that I was unwell, but she continued to ignore the chaos going on around her and ultimately left me to do all the work.

Nearing the end of the night, I asked CB to help me get the oldest child to go to sleep. He wouldn't listen to me at all. He just screamed at the top of his lungs and threw a tantrum on his bed. She told me she'd be up in a minute and that she was just facetiming her friend real quick. I was angered and I knew she wasn't gonna do anything, so I managed to get him to bed myself.

FFs come home, and talk to CB. They then pay CB $100 for ""babysitting"" their kids, and I got nothing. So before she left, I told them I had actually done everything, and added that she knew I wasn't feeling well but still left all the work up to me. She called me an ass and told me that I only ratted her out because I was ""entitled"" and ""wanted her money.""  It has some truth to it I guess because I didn't think it'd be fair if I was the one working my ass off but yet got nothing while the one who sat on her ass got paid.

0,"AITA for not apologizing, even if it costs my daughter a friendship? |   

My daughter (13) has a friend whose mom wins stuff on the radio often. Around my daughter’s birthday about 6 months ago, the mom won a pack of tickets to a music festival that she knew my daughter and hers would love. She offered for it to be my daughter’s birthday present to take her and me to the festival. She’d drive. My daughter wanted to go badly, so I said yes. The day after her birthday, we drove nearly 2 hours to this festival. It was going to be a long day and I could predict as well as our daughters got along, we would need to play referee with any fights or hormones. Early on, we go about the festival, seeing different bands and what not. The main event was later that night. 

Then we get to this game, where everyone is a winner and the prizes are related to the festival. Daughter’s friend wins a t-shirt. My daughter wins a meet and greet with one of her favorite singers and mainly the only reason why she wanted to go to this festival in the first place. I’m happy for her, until friend’s mom says “But my daughter didn’t win one.” She tried to convince the people to give her daughter one and to swap it out, but the people running the game said that it was actually the last ticket they had left to the meet and greet, and due to capacity, they couldn’t make up another. The meet and greet wasn’t until right before the main event, so I figured we could split up at that time. Daughter’s friend and her mom do something, I take my daughter to the meet and greet. (It was just a pass for one, but since she was a minor, I would be allowed in the tent so long as I didn’t try to meet the celebrity or get any pictures.) 

Daughter’s friend got a huge attitude the closer we got to the meet and greet. My daughter wasn’t bragging about it at all, but I could understand the hurt feelings. Eventually, her mom takes her to get something to eat and I take my daughter to meet her favorite singer. It all went off perfectly but daughter’s friend didn’t talk to my daughter for the rest of the night. On the ride home, the mom and I talked about random stuff but not what happened. 

A few days later, my daughter reported that her friend felt like she owed her an apology for going to the meet and greet when she couldn’t. I said if she felt that way, that was sad but that my daughter had nothing to feel sorry about. The mom later called me and said if I wanted the girls to be friends again, my daughter and myself would apologize. I told her no, we have nothing to be sorry for. The girls stopped talking at this point.

Fast forward to now and the girls have started talking again, but the mom is upset and still thinks we owe them an apology. I don’t think so. My husband thinks I should apologize so the girls can be friends again and it’s no big deal. I don’t want my daughter to think this behavior is okay.

We were all excited for the bachelorette and then Jessie said she didn't want one because she couldn't be arsed to plan it. I offered to plan everything, and I planned the perfect weekend at a spa hotel. If Jessie had any complaints she didn't tell me about them. The hotel was a few hours away so we agreed to meet there, and me and one of the cousins sorted out childcare so we could go as we both have kids.

On the Thursday night before we're meant to go Jessie calls me from A&E (emergency room). My idiot brother was on his bachelor party (a 3 day adventure trip), and fell from high enough to break a couple bones. Jessie says she now can't go to the bachelorette and as the hotel has free cancellation until noon on Friday, can I cancel the hotel. I try telling her how excited everyone is and that we can't go without her but she won't hear it and just tells me to cancel and hangs up.

I know for a fact my brother would have been fine. He's an idiot and he's broken just about every bone in his body by now. He was with our older brother and I called my older brother who said the idiot was fine, he'd just gone rock climbing and fallen because his caribiner didn't close properly. It wasn't from very high. He said he'd broken an arm and a couple ribs, but the idiot would be fine and they were letting him go as soon as they had finished with the casts and were sure there was no concussion.

My view is that there's no point giving up a great weekend because the man who has yet to go a year without breaking any bones broke another, and he's had way worse, even just in the last year or so, plus we were all looking forward to it and we'd sorted out childcare and made arrangements already. I called him on Friday and he still wasn't discharged but I asked him to talk to Jessie for me and he said he would.

Anyway, Saturday morning, we all get to the hotel. Jessie isn't here and she isn't answering her phone. I call my brother and he says Jessie is with him in the hospital. I asked when she'd be coming. Jessie takes the phone and starts getting annoyed at me, saying ""what the hell? I thought you were cancelling? Your brother is in hospital"". I tell her he's fine and me and everyone else is here now. She tells us to have a nice weekend without her.

Just as the description says, but some context is needed. My girlfriend of \~11 months has been talking about animal crossing (the new one released) as it was her favorite game growing up. She thinks the game is super cute, however whenever we watch an animal crossing video (of the new one) she always mentions how she wants to play, but could never buy a switch because she still wants to focus hard on school. She stated many times (per video) that if she ever gets animal crossing that ""It is over for my GPA"" - note she is in her 3rd year for undergrad and plans on going to grad school.

Enter her best friend (let's call her Janet) she also likes animal crossing, although probably not as much as my girlfriend. I met her through my girlfriend (we have gone for pizza runs always with my girlfriend there) and she seems super nice, always purely platonic and nothing awkward between us ever.

I know Janet's birthday is coming up (because she mentioned it) and this is where I fuck up. We all (my girlfriend, Janet, and I) hear Janet's complaints about her (long distance) boyfriend who is not her favorite. I feel bad because I already know that her (semi-flaky) boyfriend never gets her presents because he doesn't believe in giving presents (note: all yall dudes out there at least get something for your girl's birthday), however he is more than willing to receive presents from her for HIS birthday.

Here's where I come up with the good idea that makes my girlfriend very angry. I know my girlfriend would like to play the new animal crossing, but not own it because she really wants to focus on her grades. I know that Janet would love ANY present for her birthday, so why not give her something she would use and enjoy. I also know that my gf and Janet are good enough friends that they would share, and my gf would play too, just not too frequently so that she can still focus on her studies.

So Janet's birthday comes around and I get her the switch. She is really happy (probably because she didn't expect presents on her birthday) but my girlfriend is furious. She storms out of the room crying that I would give JANET such an expensive gift but not her. I explained to her that it was really for both of you as she would play it too but she is not having it.

When my older sister (24f) was 19, she had a lot of money saved, and when our dishwasher broke - my mother asked her if she wouldn't mind using about $900 to get a new dishwasher. It wasn't the landlords responsibility because we had bought and installed the dishwasher ourselves - so it was considered ""our"" problem. Sister said yes. 

Fast forward to last year and my sister lost her job of 7 years and then lost the replacement job she got due to some illnesses she was going through. Her old job let her go saying she wasn't working up to par and then her new job lied to her, said they didn't require medical certificates and then fired her for not providing medical certificates. So - while waiting for government assistance which took her 2 months - she quickly blew through her savings on rent and bills. 

She was trying to borrow money for rent and our parents offered to pay for 3 months of rent - and she pay them back when she can. After they paid the money - they were quick to change their minds and set up various terms and conditions for the loan. They wanted access to my sisters bank account so that they could control how much she was spending, and wanted my sister to stop going to the basketball team she was on (and had been on for several years that was helping her mental health and keep her physically in shape) for at least a year until she had paid them back, paid her debt (which total would only take 3 months seeing as she got a new, better paying, supportive job at the start of this year), and had 3000 dollars in savings. They wanted complete access to her bank account until all that occured. 

So my sister obviously didn't like that - but because she had already accepted the money and they'd paid it, she wasn't sure what to do. She then had an idea and asked if she could ""call it even"" from the dishwasher she bought (and still had the receipt for) from ages ago. They have now been screaming at her for the last hour about how selfish she is and that buying the dishwasher was her being a good child and 'paying her way' for living there as an adult and are now demanding MORE conditions for her accepting this loan.

When I moved in I got a parking spot in the garage. My car is to sit on the right hand of the front, and on trash days I park in the back of the garage to allow the trash cans to go outside. 

Now this hasn’t been a problem. The girl I park next to doesn’t like to share space in the front (she doesn’t leave much room for me to get out of the drivers side) but I don’t move my car much except weekends so I park in the back indefinitely since that’s technically an extension of my spot. 

When I moved in I noticed an electric scooter charging in the back by my car. The landlady only told me about the girl I’d park next to in the front and that the rest of the garage was for storage and laundry. The scooter didn’t affect me at first since it was out of my way, and was usually parked out on the street. 

Now I get an email from the tenant who owns the scooter telling me to move my car into the back because he can’t access the charging spot. I say ok because I’m having a bad day and don’t need conflict. This resident has also been here for 9 years.

The meters are messy and actually I pay the bill for the building technically since every other apartment got metered on its own except mine (weird set up, landlady knows about it and we have a deal on what to do). I’m kind of concerned he’s adding to my electric bill by having his scooter in the back, but mainly irritated he made me move my car from the front of the garage. 

So WIBTA if I reached out to my landlady to confirm that he’s not supposed to be parking there? I don’t want to create conflict, but I don’t want my electric bill to be higher than it needs to be if he’s doing this covertly.",False,False,2,4,1,3,1,3,Fairness
0,"AITA for not caring about my brother's financial issues? | My brother's 26 and has a lot of financial issues. Mainly, he's constantly broke. The issue is that he spends his money on gadgets and gambles the rest of his paycheck away. He owes people $1,000 for various things, and only pays a little bit at a time before he buys other stuff or mods for his Civic.

He texted to me venting about how awful his day was. Customers yelled at him, and he gambled his last $60 away and doesn't even have food until Friday. He said it's like the world just hates him. I told him that sucks, and he asked if I care. I said that while I hate angry customers, the world isn't out to get him and he needs to be more responsible with his money.

He told me off for giving unsolicited advice, and one of his girls texted me saying it's not my place to tell my older brother what to do since I'm only 19. AITA?

0,"AITA for complaining about my roommate? | My boyfriend and I woke up Saturday morning eager to get our errands done, so we could head to a fun, free event going on in our city. I heard my roommate and her boyfriend cooking up a storm the night before, so I expected the kitchen to be a bit rough. We run our errands, go to the grocery store, and head home. Our plan is to quickly cook up some meat we had marinating overnight and then head to the event. However, the kitchen is horrendous.Both sides of the sink stacked full of dishes, zero plates in the cabinet, zero forks in the drawer, all the counter space covered with dirty pans, grease, and crumbs, etc. And the straw that broke the camel's back was seeing my poor cast iron, covered with food and water, strewn in the sink. I take pride in caring for my cast iron, and it's my favorite cooking utensil that I make just about every meal in.


We realize that we will not be able to quickly cook our food and head out. At the bare minimum we need to clean the cast iron, season it, clean plates and utensils to use, and clear a workspace on the counter. My boyfriend and I thought we had the house to ourselves since the roommate in question is usually at her boyfriend's place on Saturdays, and my other roommate had just left. So we crank up some tunes and get to work on the kitchen. As we clean we're venting about the mess, how it inconveniences us, no respect for our dishes, so ready to be done with roommates (my boyfriend is currently buying his first house), and stuff like that. It takes us a while to get it usable and get our lunch cooked, but by the time we're about ready to eat we've put a load through the dishwasher, wiped down the counters, hand washed a couple dishes, and shoved everything else to one side of the sink.




Then, my roommate opens her door and walks to the bathroom…Oh shit. She was here the whole time. I wonder if she heard us complaining about her? She definitely did, her room is right next to the kitchen and our walls are super thin. I feel bad that my roommate heard me venting about her, but was I being an asshole? My complaints were coming from a place of exasperation, and I kind of hope this event was an eye opener to her. Maybe in the future she'll be more considerate of common places, and try to think about how others will need to use the space after her.",False,False,3,4,2,2,3,3,Fairness
0,"AITA for not paying for my roommates gf’s car being towed? | Back story - I live in a 4 bedroom apartment. We have 3 larger rooms and one smaller one, instead of paying different rent, the smaller room gets the one driveway spot we have (city living). 2 months ago, my roommate with the spots gf decides to change careers, and does not re up her lease in an adjoining town. Decides to move home, save some money while she starts her new career. 

Except she never really changed jobs, and over the next few weeks we discovered she didn’t move home either. She had essentially moved into our apartment full time without either of them ever discussing it with us or offering. Kind of annoying, we only have 1 bathroom, so showering has been a pain, she’s had people over when we’re not home. Most annoyingly we never really know if she’s there or not, regardless of whether or not he is, since they’re basically trying to be sneaky. All this, and no mention of helping out on bills or rent.

Flash forward to two nights ago, I get home quite late - midnight or so. I know smaller room roommate is up at his parents for the night, and I can’t find a parking spot due to street cleaning, so decide to park in his spot. I should’ve shot him a text, but it being so late, and me leaving for work by 730 or so, figured it’d just bother him. Little did I know, he had given his gf his key to stay over after her night shift (nurse). When she got back at 7, she saw my car, and then parked on the street before coming in and going to sleep. Due to the aforementioned street cleaning, she was towed. I obviously feel bad I used his spot without asking, but had assumed she was up at his parents with him like she always is.

My roommate is asking I pay the fine, but I have two thoughts.  One, if they had been more forthright about her coming and going I obviously wouldn’t have used the spot or assumed she was up with him at his parents like usual. Two, she’ll be living with us for 3 months without paying any rent or expenses by the time they leave in September after the current lease.

Back when it was first founded I obviously needed employees so I hired my aunt, brother, and sister as the first few. The company grew and so with it I started hiring qualified strangers to work, however all three of the relatives mentioned above still work there to this day. I try to avoid hiring other friends or family unless they'd die without some money because I don't want to be accused of nepotism. The employees however know that I treat my brother/sister/aunt the same as other employees in work, outside is different.

  Here comes the part in the title. My cousin (my aunt's daughter) recently graduated high school and she doesn't want to go to college because she thinks it's a waste of time and money. Unsurprisingly she couldn't land a job other than a McDonald's because she has literally no qualifications whatsoever. So my aunt approaches me with this brilliant idea to hire my cousin and that we could all benefit from it, you know a win-win all around. Except I don't know how I would benefit, almost everyone on Earth is more qualified for this job than her. I tell her I'd think about it.

A can be a very nice, caring person and good listener but also selfish and entitled, especially when it comes to doing work for/with her. Also she's the type of person who will always ask for your advice but will literally do the exact opposite of what you told her.

Actual story: about two weeks ago, we were at a club (basically our entire year was there, as we are graduating soon). Until 10pm, all cocktails were 50% off. I arrived at about 9:15. A greeted me by telling me that there was no space at her table for me, but no where else either as she hadn't reserved a seat for me (thanks, I guess?). Afterwards, I immediately got in line for some drinks. A was right in front of me and at about 9:30 it was her turn to order. She ordered at least 15 cocktails. The bartender started taking her order and A was being an annoying customer. Why? While ordering A would ask what was in every single kind of cocktail and how it was made. This question-answer-game took about 5-10 minutes. Finally the bartender started making the drinks slowly.

A kept interrupting her and asking why she was doing whatever she was doing at that moment. Another 10 minutes pass and not even half the drinks are made. People in line are becoming impatient.
It's 9:45 and A looks at her watch, turns around to us and says in the most smug way possible with a grin on her face ""oh well, you guys only have 10 minutes left, you better hurry up"". Another five minutes pass. Again A turns around ""well, that'll be close for you"". At 9:58, all the drinks are made. All A had to do was pay. A and another girl decided to split the bill and started arguing about who would pay what.
9:59, they start getting their small change out. They pay all the drinks that way which takes at least another two minutes. Well, happy hour might be over, but this story sure isn't.
I decided to pull a Karen and wanted to speak to the manager, A friend and I went looking for him and we met A, who asked us what we were doing. I told her and she replied ""hm, at least I still got MY drinks, so I'm fine"" while grinning and trying to blow me a kiss. I slapped her hand away and told her to fuck off.

A later comes up to me, telling me she's sorry I'm upset but it's not her fault, The bartender was being fast and I shouldn't be mad. She then offered me one of her drinks that I could just pay her for. I refused. 
About 20 minutes later A comes to me and starts yelling at me. She thinks it's stupid that I'm upset about that, I tell her to leave, she yells that she won't unless I'm not upset anymore about something stupid like this. I lost it and also yelled at her, telling her to fuck off. She then returns to her table and loudly tells people there how dumb I am being. Later she texted me, wanting to talk.

I told him that he didnt know what I was going through, he would never be able to live through what I've lived through, and that he wasn't aware when he was going through his birth defect so he can't possibly understand. He proceeded to tell me that he could've died in his infancy, which is well known by my family and my parents treat him like an angel because of that.
I told him ""ok you might have died but you're alive, and at least you don't have to live with the consequences that your birth defect brought you"" and he told me I was an asshole.

A few days later I'm talking to my parents and they tell me that what I said was wrong on so many levels and that I shouldnt have brought up Jared's birth defect, and that I should apologise for being so mean to Jared.

Neither him nor I pay rent, but I pay for my own school and much of my own living expenses, in addition to contributions to the household like helping with groceries and items for around the house such as Kleenex, paper towels, or q-tips.

My brother is taking online courses which in his own words are 'very cheap' and he works 4 days a week. He barely buys his own stuff, let alone for the household. My mom buys his soap, food, bus passes, etc. He even tries to eat my food I've labeled 'NoNo' (as in 'No Noelle (my name)' - don't eat). It really pisses me off that he eats my food, takes my stuff & doesn't contribute anything. I'm fed up with it. I've brought it up to my mom several times and she always says ""I know"" or ""I can't make him contribute"" or ""I don't want to cause an argument.""

I buy q-tips to help me apply my makeup. No one else tends to use them as my parents say they're not good to stick in your ears. The other day, my brother said his ears 'felt dirty' and did we have any q-tips. I said no. Later he went into the bathroom and saw q-tips sitting in my makeup drawer. He asked if I'd forgotten I had them. I said no I hadn't but I didn't want to share them. He was like 'um excuse me.' I told him he needs to start buying his own toiletries and food and start contributing to the house more, and that it's not fair we have to buy things to support him too. He works, and frankly makes more money than me yet has less expenses because his schooling is barely $400/semester vs my upwards of $4000. 

He freaked out on me and said I'm a selfish bitch for not letting him use q-tips of all things, and that I wouldn't act this way with mom or dad. I said he was correct, because mom and dad and I have a nice, reciprocal relationship where we all buy things to share. Sometimes my mom will buy chips and wine for us all, then I'll go to the grocery store and pickup the fixings for pizza for dinner, etc. I told him it would probably be best if he became a part of the reciprocation rather than taking all the time. 

He stormed off and slammed the door to his room shut. He thinks I'm a major asshole and there's been a super thick air of tension in the house since. My mom says she understands I'm frustrated, but was this really worth it? I honestly kind of think it is.

One issue that comes from that environment is that people tend to slack off and not work. Anyways, I was on my break and had gone out to grab some dinner for myself. When I walked into our employee break room, there were 6-7 of my coworkers in there just hanging out, none of whom were on break. There is one table in the room that almost all of us eat our meals at during break. That table was all full, so I said “someone who is sitting down needs to stand up”. While I know this may come across as a bit demanding, I meant to carry a sarcastic tone and it’s definitely something that we would say at work, since most of us are around the same age and have a drier sense of humor. I had to ask a few times before finally someone stood up, and my coworker, let’s call him Derek, muttered something under his breath. I didn’t think much of it and sat down to eat my burger and fries. About 5 minutes later (in the middle of a conversation my coworkers were having, which I was not a part of) he yelled at me that I had “disrespected him”, in front of my coworkers.

The name the cat had and the name I really wanted to name my next pet were the same, Alaska! 

Fast forward to last weekend, my landlords mom passed away and she left behind a 3 year old cat named Bella. My landlord asked me if I could take her in replace of Alaska, which I was fine with. Here’s the issue: she wants to rename the cat after her mom, Tammy.

I politely told her I don’t think it’s fair to change the cats name since it’s not a kitten anymore and I was fine with what her name was. She’s literally been pestering me about it since the cat has gotten here. Asking how Tammy is or is Tammy settling in her new home, etc.

I had to basically play nurse as she couldn’t even use the restroom on her own. Whenever I got a chance, I would try to eat out and go swimming or explore, but since my friend needed me, my time was limited. I managed to squeeze in one hike and that’s it. Obviously, it was not exactly a traditional vacation for the reasons I’ve outlined.

she then went that the word kiwi is offensive to maoris, so I asked her if she could show me a artical or something that proved that, as I had never heard of this, she refused. 
 I then asked her if she was a maori, she said no, so I asked her again if she was a maori, she said no, she then got super annoyed and said, why did you need to ask me twice.

Yesterday however, he texts saying that if we cannot find the whiteboard, that he wants £250 for it. Bearing in mind he is in a far better financial position than our family. We call his grandad (the father of the dad) to apologise for losing it. But he can barely remember giving it. Proving the item is not some generations old family memento.

The 2 year old is crying about who knows what and the 4 and 5 year old are bickering very loudly. It took them all about 5 mins to really get on my nerves I didn't want to cause a scene by confronting the parents directly so I talked to an employee about getting a different table but we were a party of 6 so unfortunately we couldn't be accommodated the employee however tell us she would talk to the family which we saw her do. Not even another 5 minutes goes by and the 4 and 5 year old are smacking the table loudly complaining about them being hungry and keep in mind they're being quite loud and the parents are doing fuck all about it. I decided to not say anything to anyone because I figured that the staff would handle it, I was wrong.

0,"AITA for not accommodating my friends dietary restrictions? | I have a friend who frequently complains about being lactose intolerant and having a sensitive stomach in general. She brings it up in group settings all the time and says she can’t eat certain things. However, she also often eats those things when she’s on her own or when something looks too good to pass up at a party or dinner out. The result of this is that although she’s constantly talking about her stomach problems and claiming she can’t eat this and that, she often (I would say at least 50% of the time) ends up eating the very things she says she can’t tolerate. 

In the past I’ve gone out of my way to ensure I had food available for her at parties and other gatherings, like I do for all my friends. I have several vegetarian friends, one vegan friend, one friend who doesn’t eat pork for religious reasons and one gluten free friend and I do my absolute best to make sure they have several options whenever we’re getting together or when choosing a restaurant. The difference is that they follow these dietary restrictions 100% of the time and seem to appreciate the effort put in to accommodate them. They also take turns picking restaurants and having people over and they do the same to accommodate each other’s dietary stuff. Whenever I go to the friend in questions house or she brings something to a party or whatever it only meets her own dietary restrictions about 50% of the time. Even if she brings something that does meet her dietary restrictions she’ll also eat everything else provided (and then complain to us later when she doesn’t feel well.) 

So, I have a small Christmas gathering coming up and I want to make mini cheesecakes.

1,"AITA for leaving a restaurant without paying my bill? | There was a post here a couple of days ago that made me think about an event a while ago. 

There was a new all you can eat Japanese restaurant opening in our city and I decided to go with a friend on what I think was the 5th day of their opening week. 
Their formula was that you have a maximum of 10 rounds in which you order something (so not really all you can eat...) and it gets delivered to your table. 
I was a bit disappointed from the start but the options looked good so we placed the first round of orders and waited for that. 

It took half an hour for each of our single bite dishes to come. Granted, the restaurant was almost full, but the kitchen was open and we could see that there was plenty of staff working there, and we were just apologized to for the delay, so I'm not sure what caused it.

No biggie, food was pretty okay, ordered a second round. This time, it took almost 45 minutes for our orders to arrive. Remember, we were with just two, and we ordered a plate with 3 sushi on it and a portion of edamama (cooked soy beans with salt). 
At this point, I'm getting pretty hangry since I saved a lot of place for food and I'm getting impatient. Food is still good, we place a third order. 

No one comes at our table for over an hour. We talk with other people in the place who are also waiting for their orders, even drinks are coming in slow. There were 3 waiters walking around talking to people and we get an another apology but no explanation. 
Our orders were 2 bites of sushi each, and at this point I was fed up with waiting and told my friend if there's no food in 20 minutes, I'm walking out without paying. 

We ended up waiting 30 minutes at the insistence of my friend, but still no food. We left then, went somewhere else, finally had food. 

I've never walked out of a restaurant before, but I think I was justified at this point. Kitchen was still fully equipped, from my guess it was the order system that had something going wrong with it, but waiting three hours for our third round of small bites it just terrible service imo.

The company gives me a range and maximum of how much the company can offer to candidates. We are told to give the offer starting slightly higher than average range. The industry average for this position is 55K so we offer 56 starting and cannot go over 70. For both hires, we were willing to go to 70. There is expectation candidates will negotiate. 

For both hires, I started at 56. They had similar experience and the interview committee had positive feedback for both. 

The man came back asking for 68, we went back and forth and agreed at 65. The woman agreed at 56 and did not ask for more. 

Both hires salary history were similar. His old job was 45k and her had 42k. Maybe she was satisfied with the 16k jump. Both hires made a big salary jump even though the woman could have asked for much more.

0,"AITA for refusing to pay an old debt? | So this happened about 8 years ago and still has ripples of tension in the family.

My great-grandmother gifted me her old car.  The car was a bit of a lemon, had several things wrong with it, but I was very appreciative.  I put several thousand dollars of repairs into that car over many years.  Eventually, it was getting to the point where I needed a new car.  I asked her if I could buy the car from her so I can use it as a trade in for a new car.  

She said sure and she was willing to sell it to me for the value of trade in and had me sign a napkin stating so.

As it turns out, the trade-in was only worth like $1000 because of the physical and mechanical damage.  I told my grandmother that I was able to trade it in for $2500 because I didn't want to hurt her feelings and I wanted to repay her kindness for letting me use the car in the first place.

Well, about $1000 into paying her off, she passes away.  About a week after the funeral, I get a notice from my Aunt who has been appointed the executor of the estate and asks what my plan is to repay the $1500.  

I tell her the full story and politely ask if the debt can be forgiven.  She gives me a very brash ""NO"".

When my grandmother passed she had no debts. She had about a hundred thousand in stocks and bonds that all went to my aunts on top of about $250,000 in real estate.

There was a lot of back and forth about ""It's not about paying us, it's about her estate"". My argument was ""My debt was to her and she's gone."", and I fulfilled my obligation of paying her the trade-in value of the car.

After that, I got an email saying ""You can either pay this debt or you can be out of this family.""  I told her politely to pound sand.

0,"AITA for stopping financial “support” for incarcerated family member? | I’m 41. Uncle (my mother’s brother) is 65. He went to jail about 18 mos ago. 

Prior to him going to jail, the only person in my family on speaking terms with him was his mother/my Gma. He has burned a lot of bridges with friends and family and basically has no one.  I had not spoken to him in nearly 10 years after he stole a bunch of money from my Gma and pulled her out of a nursing home and dumped that mess in my lap. No love lost.

When he went to jail (he likely will go to prison and die there), his dog was taken to a shelter by the police. I live on the other side of the country but organized a home for the dog and was able to avoid having him euthanized. (I couldn’t take the dog due to a ban breed where I live.)

That involvement turned into me becoming Power of Attorney to deal with his house, bills, etc as well as having access to his bank account and sending him money for his commissary account in jail.

The thing is, he’s a jerk. He’s mean and a “dry drunk”.  He was pretty rude to me a few times and gave a buddy of his (who has the dog) a debit card so money is just disappearing and he refuses to let me shut down the card but yells at me when he balance isn’t as expected.  I finally told him to “find someone else” to do his bidding and that I was done.. I don’t need the abuse. I cut him off before for this sort of behavior and am just not interested in signing  up for it in the long term.

But...he literally has no one else. My mother and brothers don’t want anything to do with him. My Gma is incapable of helping with these activities. His buddy with the card is basically like my Gma with no internet ability. So it’s me or nothing.

He uses snacks and toiletries from the commissary to kind of “buy” friends and safety though. He’s gay and I get the impression that if I don’t keep moving money around for him, he may be at physical risk.

I would never say I’m better than him or anything like that but I definitely know what I’m doing. 

Admittedly I’ve never actually had most of his food other then the occasional salad as I’m a vegan and my brother doesn’t cook for our family often, but always cooks meat when he does. He always says he didn’t learn much about vegan cooking in culinary school but “how hard could it be.”

I cook for my family about once or twice a week when I have time. They like meat but they do enjoy certain vegan meals occasionally. My brother sometimes but not always offers his help. I always turn it down because he’s a nightmare in the kitchen to work with. He completely takes over and wants to change everything. He also always takes his time doing everything because he “has to rush at work so won’t be rushed at home” so making a salad dressing takes him like honestly 40 minutes. He’s very much a “backseat cook” and I hate hate hate it. My mom does too - she asked me to help her with Christmas dinner instead of my brother just because she doesn’t find his help helpful.

0,"WIBTA if I told my SO to cut back on complaining about being bald? (31F, 31M) | Together 2 yrs. He went bald in his teens, completely bald by age 19 or 20. No medical condition, just very early onset male pattern baldness. I am hugely sympathetic – your hair is a big part of how you look, and I can’t imagine how hard that’d be as a teen. Not diminishing the importance or what a big deal that is to guys, especially so young. I get it. 

He is going to interview for medical residency soon and all he can talk about is how no one is going to hire him because he’s bald. He’s 6’2”, slim and athletic (swimmer/runner body), Caucasian, very handsome and symmetrical face, perfect teeth. Some people don’t like the bald look, but everything else is conventionally perfect. And he’s very sociable, intelligent, great with kids (looking for pediatric-related residency, so that’s relevant), has good grades, etc.

He goes on and on about how being bald is going to hold him back, nobody’s going to hire him, he should’ve gone to school for a job where you don’t interact with the public so employers might still hire him and just keep him in the background where nobody has to see him. In short, he’s being ridiculous, but he actually says this stuff very seriously, every single day.

I, on the other hand, am a very petite (4’11”, 95 lb), very young-looking (I was carded for an R-rated movie last year), dark-skinned black woman, also a doctor.  I started a little younger than he did, so I’m almost done with my surgery-related residency. It’s a constant struggle for me to be taken seriously as a surgeon. I am ALWAYS confused for a secretary or medical assistant (at best, a nurse) even when I’m in my surgical scrubs. This includes patients, staff, and other doctors. Patients don’t trust my advice, staff don’t take my instructions as seriously, colleagues aren’t always welcoming. That’s its own story, suffices to say I have a hard time and probably always will.

I just deal with it (what choice do I have?) but it’s really bothering me lately how much my SO whines about being bald when he otherwise has THE most stereotypical “doctor look” ever. I honestly want to tell him that I’m not the right person to complain to about that, considering how much harder I objectively have it, and that he needs to grow up. It just makes me roll my eyes being a dark-skinned black woman who looks like a third-grader, comforting this tall, thin, athletic, handsome white man about how he’s such a poor victim of genetics and will never be accepted into medicine because he has no hair, and reassuring him that he isn’t too “weird looking” to get a residency. Get a grip.

WIBTA if I told him how tone-deaf he’s being and to stop complaining to me about it? Again, I know going bald is a big deal.

0,"AITA for telling off my mom for pressuring me through my daughter to have a second child? | My husband and I have a 5-year-old daughter. Right now, she’s the only grandchild on either side of the family. Originally, my husband and I talked about having more kids, and we weren’t sure if we would have more. After discussing it at length, we decided that we are one and done. We’re confident in this choice to the point that my husband is getting a vasectomy. Now, she probably won’t be the only grandkid on my husband’s side, as he has a brother who’s engaged and they say they plan on having kids a little after the wedding. However, I am an only child, not by choice. My parents wanted a large family but were unable to, I was due to have a brother but he sadly passed away not long after birth. So, my daughter will always be their only granddaughter.

We didn’t make a huge announcement about not having more kids, we just figured we’d tell people as it came up. As it so happened, one of my cousins got pregnant and my mom and I went in on a bigger gift for her shower. While we were shopping, my mom mentioned number two for me and I told her “Yeah, Husband and I decided we’re not going to.” She completely overreacted, started crying, etc. She’s not typically a dramatic person, but I should’ve see that coming. Ever since, she’s tried bringing it up, but we’ve stayed firm. We hadn’t told her about my husband’s vasectomy.

Now, my daughter has never asked for a baby brother or sister, but she did create an imaginary older sister for herself. It’s cute, age appropriate. She brings her everywhere and I don’t really mind it. My mom, however, takes this as a cue to ask her constantly “Well don’t you want a baby brother or sister?” and my daughter just shrugs and tries to go back on playing. I tell my mom to cut it out, but she says she’s “just asking” and there’s no harm in getting her opinion. Frankly, my 5-year-old doesn’t get a say in whether or not she gets a baby sibling. She can create an imaginary sibling group for all I care.

Then, the other day, my mom asked my daughter yet again and when my daughter didn’t respond, she said “You need to tell Mommy she should put a baby in her tummy”. I turned to my mom and told her that if she brought up the topic of a baby again, she wouldn’t be allowed around my daughter, and to shut up about the topic in general. I said I was sick and tired of having this discussion and that she just wanted to live vicariously through me. She got very upset, then left the house.

0,"WIBTA if I took my Netflix away from my parents and deleting my Spotify account for them stealing my Spotify? | Throwaway for my AITA posts. 15 Male for context, so sorry if I make high school level grammatical errors and such. Also for later in the story, keep in mind my mother has my e-mail monitored so she can see whatever e-mail I receive.  I've always loved music, tv, and movies. So both Netflix and Spotify are no-brainers for a guy like me. I decided to cut a deal with my parents (in 2017 when I got it) and make it so that when I worked at my volunteer job, they would pay me minimum wage (USD 7.25). The first thing I decided to spend my well-earned money on was a Spotify Premium subscription. The counter was that it would have to be billed from my parent's bank account for the time being as I am not legally allowed to open one in my state due to the fact I'm under 16. My parents accepted the offer and so we subtracted $15 from my monthly wage to pay for my Spotify as time continued.

My grandparents are cool as far as grandparents go. They love video games, music, movies, and all of the other things I like. Eventually, in 2018, they decided to get a Netflix subscription for them and me. Soon, I decided to ask my grandparents if I could put the account on to my parent's tv service so my family and I could watch anything we so desired, they accepted to my surprise. I, therefore, did what I got permission to do and put our account on to my parent's living room TV so we could watch more media.

Fast forward to now, my mother ends up changing my Spotify password so she can use it to listen to music in the car(even though she has been perfectly content with using the radio for years!). I don't mind the fact that she wants to listen to music, but I pay for that with my own money and her taste in music and mine are very different (I like old stuff from the 1930s all the way to the 1980s while she prefers the stuff most people listen to nowadays, which is not the kind of thing I can stand to listen to{not to offend anyone}). Also, she listens to it ALL DAY and Spotify only allows your account to be used once at a time. So now I keep getting recommended rap music, my friends keep questioning my apparent change in taste of music, and I can't listen to music on my account as my mother keeps stealing it. Whenever I talk to her about it, she says that she pays for it so she gets to use it. Which is not true!\^\^\^

(Side note: they also are annoyed I won't give them the password to the Netflix so they can use it on their other devices)

So, I've been thinking, and I believe I have a fair plan. My grandparents are fine with me paying them money to support my Spotify account until I can get a bank account. So I personally see it fit to delete my Spotify account, start a new personal e-mail to run a new one and other services off of, and delete the Netflix from the Living Room TV. Does this seem a fair punishment to them after I have asked them to stop using something I pay for and they get greedy with the Netflix they don't own?

We have rhyming names, my mom always tried to get us matching clothes, and we shared a bedroom. That’s never bothered S like it bothers me. She always wanted to do same activities as me and hang out with my friend group. 

When we were 18, she applied to a few of the same colleges as me but she’s never been as good of a student and she didn’t get into my dream school and I did. I hid it but I was really excited. Ultimately, it was good for us that S went to a different college. Our relationship improved when I had my own space where I could be myself and not one of the interchangeable twins. 

I went to graduate school so I didn’t get married until last year. After the wedding, we moved to my hometown to raise our kids close to family. S has been married for four years. Unfortunately, her husband SH is unable to have kids. They decided to adopt, which I think is fantastic. 

I’m currently pregnant and having a girl. My husband and I spent a lot of time picking out the perfect name for our future child. I feel SO good about this name.

Yesterday, S and SH announced to the family (remotely) that they are officially about to adopt a little girl. They wanted a baby but ended up having to go with a slightly older kid, 5. She looks absolutely precious and I was so happy for a few seconds before they announced her name is B, the name that S KNOWS is my daughter's.

I thought that was a joke so I kind of laughed. Then I realized they were serious. Obviously the girls can’t have the same name. Twins with daughters with the same name??? Everyone would laugh at us. I feel like all of my problems with S will repeat themselves as everyone compares the girls and lumps them together because they have the same name. They won't be able to have a good relationship because of this. I don't want people nicknaming my kid to distinguish her because I like the FULL name I chose. And I can't help but suspect that S picked a kid with the same name on purpose just like she always wanted to be like me when we were kids. 

I am planning to talk to S about the situation. One of us needs to change our kid's name and I'm hoping she'll be reasonable. 

My kid will get here first (I'm almost at my due date) and I picked out the name first.

A lot of parents change their adopted kids’ names. They could do that. 

If the kid won't change her name, S and SH could go with a different kid. There are thousands upon thousands of orphans who need loving homes and 99.9999% of them don't have this one particular name. They haven't bonded with this one yet. I already have bonded with my baby and I can't imagine her with another name.

My mom and I told her once the lasagna goes in the oven, it will take about 40 minutes to cook then need to sit for 5-10 minutes before we should cut it, so she said she would just cook something for herself on the stovetop that would cook in less than 45 minutes that she'd start once the lasagna was in the oven.

Except the lasagna was done early then expected, at the 25 minute mark. I took it out and let it sit for 5 minutes then we started eating it; at this point my sister said her dinner still needed 10 minutes because the rice was still cooking, and she thought ours wasn't supposed to be done for another 15 minutes. I just shrugged and said 'sorry it was done early.'

By the time my sister's dinner was done, we were already done eating. She said she was just going to go to her room to eat because she didn't want to be stared at while she ate while everyone else was done. Thought this was a bit of an overreaction cuz she could've just sat there while we talked.

I was able to get the system, but ultimately, I did not like the iphone and wanted to go back to the android. This isn't a whole android vs. iphone thing, I don't really care about that debate. I understand why people like the iphone. The android suits me better. It was within the 2 week period so it shouldn't be an issue. 

I got to the store and had a worker help me. I told him that I wanted to trade this phone in for an android and maybe go up the one I initially had (I had a 9, wanted to do a 10 instead). For some reason, this worker could not fathom why I would want to  trade an iphone in for an android. He kept going on and on about how great his iphone is and I just told him that I prefer the android and just wanted to get one already. This went on for a while and I was getting pissed that he kept fighting me on this for some reason.  It got to a point where another worker came over and asked if everything was okay. I kind of snapped and said that I just wanted to get an android, trade this phone in, and leave. The other worker apologized and took over and everything was settled within 30 mins or so. 

So a couple days ago, I went back into the store to clear up a billing issue and get a new case when I got the same second worker that helped me out in the end. We talked for a bit and I found out they ended up letting the other worker go. Turns out the issue with me was the last straw. I couldn't believe it.

1,"AITA for Wedding Conversation Gone Wrong? | Somehow my gf (23F) and I (28M) got to talking about marriage and wedding rings. We've been together almost three years. I mentioned how a co-worker's husband spent 6k on an engagement ring and I was like ""yeah, I want to go under that."" My gf looked up the average price of a ring and said it was about 6k and I believe my words were ""yeah, you're not getting that,"" which I admit probably stung but wasn't what I meant.

Then, to compound all this, we got to talking about weddings and I talked about how much money they are and how I didn't want to blow through all my savings just for one day. Then she said ""You know girls plan this stuff since they're, like, 8, right?"" and I said ""Yeah"" and then she went quiet.

She cried off and on all day yesterday and it completely ruined both of our days. At night she said some very scary things and it seemed way too overboard for what had happened.

We try to keep the dog poop picked up in the backyard and have a scooper and dog poop specific trash can that we keep in the corner of the yard because 1) it stinks and 2) it is less likely to be disturbed.

 Boyfriend picked up the yard a week or so ago and moved the can to the middle of our yard so the can would be in a central location. No problem. He also removed the lid of the can. Okay, that's fine but weird since it has an attached lid and foot pedal to open it. Well was not moved back or re-covered and is still in the center of the yard. 

Yesterday, we had some big storms come through with high wind gusts. Right before it started getting bad, I asked again for the trash can to be moved and the lid put on as I was afraid it might blow over. My boyfriend kind of shrugged it off and said it would be fine, that he has left it there before and it wasn't a problem. Of course, right after this conversation it started raining harder. I  got upset and yelled at him to go do it because we were about to get hit with the storms. He again refused and laughed at me, which made me angrier. I admit that I did exacerbate the situation with my tone but I don't feel that I was wrong for asking. I made it very clear that if it fell over, I was not going to be responsible for cleaning it up and boyfriend didn't say anything to the contrary.
 The storm blows through and trash can is fine. I didn't bring it up again.

 Today, the dogs are running around in the yard and manage to hit the trash can and knock it over. A sizeable mound of wet dog poop/water comes pouring out. I immediately get the dogs back inside because I am afraid they will run through it and track it through the house (we have a dog door). I take a picture and send it to my boyfriend who is currently at work. I let him know that I blocked off the dogs from going outside so they won't step in it before he gets home and cleans it up. He responds that the dogs don't need to be cooped up and that he will handle it when he gets home if he needs to. Ok sounds good. 

 He then replies that he is at work and I could have already handled it.

I live in a two bedroom basement suite with another guy I'll call Gary. For the past few months, our landlord has been pretty absent (I heard from one of her other tenants that she's apparently getting a divorce but that's not super relevant). Our place is pretty old, and things have been breaking/needing replacement. Here's a few of the things that have happened in the past month:

1. The washing machine needed some parts replaced
2. The sink started leaking
3. The fuse box had to be re-set

We texted the landlord about getting these things fixed, but she would take days to respond. Eventually, I decided to fix the things myself. I had to do some googling to figure out how to do everything properly. I had to pay out of pocket for the washing machine parts and the tools to fix the sink. Gary never offered to help pay, but he did thank me for fixing everything and said he ""owed me one.""

This week, I found myself short on grocery money because I got laid off due to reasons I think we're all familiar with. Gary hasn't been laid off, and is working from home. I asked Gary if we could talk, and asked him to give me $30 every week for the next few weeks until I got my job back. He said that I wasn't his responsibility. I told him he owed me for the repairs I did around the house, and the time I spend researching how to perform the repairs, plus the time I took actually doing them. $30 isn't a lot of money, especially since he has a full time job. Plus, if it wasn't for me, we'd be living in a crap shack. I told him this, and he told me to fuck off and stop ""pretending to be the landlord.""

I work at a massage clinic as a massage therapist. We have had several issues this year with theft by employees. Not only theft of our cash tips but money from the register and items left by clients in the lost and found in the office safe. We do have cameras in the lobby, the office and the break room.  
After I came back to work after my weekend, I noticed that in my cubby spot that hangs on the wall, a few very low value items are missing. Several of us have this item at work. I bring it up to a person at the front desk who said that along with my items the others that were found were turned in to the manager. Everyone but me had their items returned. These items are not prohibited in any way. 
Now, I fully understand that the items in question are very inexpensive but the fact is I feel violated for having my possessions taken from me. So on our office group chat, I asked that my items be returned by Friday or I will report the theft to HR.  Well, Friday came and my items were not returned so I reported the theft to HR.  
So my boss never confronted me about the group chat post and was well aware of the missing items but didn’t seem to concerned about it until I reported it to HR. Now my boss is telling me I’m threatening people and offered to pay for my missing items. I told him no. That theft is theft regardless of the value of the item stolen. He thinks Im blowing this way out of proportion and maybe I am, but considering how poorly he handled previous thefts, I have lack of faith that he can/will handle this appropriately. 
For those of you who might ask why I don’t keep belongings in a locker. I do not bring anything to work that i would need to keep that safe. I keep my ID on me and only deal in cash so I don’t have a debit card. I have no reason to take up a whole locker.

Anyways, the first was a boy who i named after my father. The second is going to be a girl, and she already has the name chosen (not an important name to her or anything, just one she thinks is pretty and really likes).

She was always there for me growing up and we were close as kids, so I said sure of course!

She said the deal was that she got to choose the name, that I already named our son after my family, and it was her turn.

I'm 19F, vegan for 1 year. I've been helping my mom prepare Christmas dinner since I was about 14, but this is my first fully vegan Christmas. I thought the best way to go about it would be to make all the sides vegan (half of them already were or were with the use of vegan butter instead anyways) and find a small vegan main to cook that wouldn't interfere with the turkey my mom was doing. We were doing vegan stuffing, dairy-free mashed potatoes, roasted veggies, a vegan gravy, sweet potato casserole, corn fritters, cranberry sauce to all be vegan and for myself, I was making breaded tofu to just throw in the oven once my mom took the finished turkey out to sit then carve. The only non-vegan thinks were going to be the turkey + its gravy and a bit of honey ham. My mom and dad and I and all our guests (so we thought) were happy with this. Thought everything was fine. 

My older brother also lives with us, but he's never home much so he didn't really know about the plans. He came up 1/2 an hour ago to ask if he could help in any way since he's good at this stuff (he's a chef by trade) but my mom said no because a) our kitchen is far too small for 3 people (2 is pushing it at times) and b) ""Olivia \[me\] has got all the sides under control and the turkey's just gone in the oven!"" 

Well after that my brother started inquiring about what I was doing and asked if he could help. I explained how mom assigned me all the sides so I could ensure they were vegan but maybe if we seemed really busy at the end, he could do the mashed potatoes and please just remember to use my milk and butter (tbf we only keep vegan butter in the house at this point because my parents don't think there's enough of a noticeable difference). He got really upset and asked why we were all catering to one person (me)'s dietary restrictions at Christmas. I said it was partially because I was helping to make everything so I get a bit more of a say in how it goes, and besides, there's still turkey. He shot me a ""whatever"" and went to his room.

I'll try to make this quick. 

In may of last year, I moved a few states away to be a live in nanny for a friend of the family. The agreements regarding payment were free room and board, my car insurance, pet supples (for two guinea pigs), and a TBD amount of money, discussed $50/week.

I now live with D(40s,m) and A(40s, f). They are separated, not divorced, seeing other people, and living together with their two 7 year old boys. The boys, whom I love very much, are autistic. A likes to use their diagnosis as an excuse to let them do whatever they want. 

They take food off other peoples plates and crawl around the floor at restaurants, only communicated through grunts, were flight risks so all doors had to be constantly locked, as well as running away in public, still not potty trained, and had no concepts of mealtimes, manners, or the word no. 

The reason they needed a nanny was so A could get a job and help with the bill's. 9 months later, all that has happened is she now has a reason to ignore her kids and talk to her LDBF because I'm taking care of them. 

Since I've moved in both children are now very verbal, use silverware, follow directions in public, use their manners, cover their mouths for coughs, etc.

Since I've moved in I've recieved exactly $0, D was avoiding getting my pet supplies until his gf called him an AH for not doing it, my car insurance has not been paid, and my car ultimately died due to being the daily driver for everything for two whole months since theirs was wrecked the day I got here, without them offering to do repairs.

After expressing my need to be paid, I was told I'd be paid when I ""started working"" as if I'm not the only reason the kids are now talking, eating correctly, behaving, and potty trained. 

I feel extremely taken advantage of, and that if i continue to live here and give in to them treating me the way the do because I love their kids, my mental health will continue to deteriorate. At this point at just $50/week I'm owed at least $1700.

Several months ago I met the LOML E(22m) and we plan on signing a lease this month and moving in mid-march. Everyone I've asked tells me I should wait as long as I can to tell them I'm leaving, because they'll make my life a worse hell.

Which is fine, I've just noticed some perspective differences in addition to existing cultural ones. My boyfriend has kind of acclimated/expanded some of his stuff and is open and interested in new things but that isn't quite true if his family. In general, we get on fine and I mostly keep my head down and go with the flow.

Anyway, we were at a store yesterday (me plus partner, partner's parents and sister) shopping and I overhear some people talking in french, searching for an item. I speak French pretty well, so I just replied in French and told them where to find the item. Whatever, I did not even think anything of it. 

But my partner's family saw and got kind of weird about it. Eye rolling and all that. His dad said something about speaking English in America. I did say that there's no official law that says only English is allowed. On the car ride home they were like well if you are speaking another language, who knows what you are saying about us. (I literally told her what aisle to go down, so I just wish they'd calm down).

Fast forward to Thanksgiving tonight with the extended family, and the mom starts like telling the rest of them in this backhanded way. Like I am this snob for knowing how to speak another language and replying to someone in it? And the family are teasing and I kind of snapped back. 

I told them that it's not my fault I am well educated and have been exposed to more of the world than their small white suburbs have to offer. The world doesn't revolve around them and speaking only one language isn't exactly something to be proud of. My boyfriend tried to make peace but also stood up for me.

0,"AITA for being angry at my Mom for walking in and out when she cheated? | So I'm 20 and live in my family home, around June my Mom cheated on my dad with a work colleague of both of theirs (they work in the same place together) a thing that had apparently been going on for months via text but had finally become physical when my Mom went away with her friend. My Mom confessed this to my Dad who was obviously traumatised. My Dad has had some big issues with gambling in the past and my Mom tried to use that against him to flip the situation. She then decided she needed space and moved out around 2 months ago which I understood, she continued to see this other guy she'd cheated on my dad with who is trying, bless him, to keep everything together. 

Around a week ago my Mom just burst in out of the blue into the house with no warning and was acting like it never happened, talking to us both normally and such, we even spent the next day eating pizza in our PJ's. I knew my Dad wouldn't have wanted any drama because my Mom was really worried that my dad had 'turned me against her', which hasn't happened, it's their relationship and it's not mine to judge or fix, if they begin to act differently as parents that's when I should be concerned. 

Tonight my Dad text me to say my Mom was back home while I was out and in all honesty I was annoyed. I had to cycle back on my ancient torture device of a bike in pouring rain and was in a bad mood because of this, and knocked on the door; out of breath and tired. My Mom answers the door and proceeds to make monster noises at me like she has done since I was a Kid, probably expecting me to be okay with her just showing up again without any warning or telling either me or my Dad as I was a couple days before. I let my anger get the better of me and just said 'Yes. I know you're here, I saw the car in the driveway' without looking at her in a pretty annoyed tone. She then announced she was going to bed straight away, having been sat with my Dad before I came in. My Dad tells me to go and say Hello and I go on a very quiet yet annoyed rant as to how I shouldn't have to because it's not fair of her to just be walking in and out of the house when she pleases as if nothing ever happened. Guilt gets the better of me and I go to say hello not 3 minutes later but her head's under the covers and she doesn't respond, pretending to be asleep, obviously upset I didn't react well to her being home. 

At the end of the day she's my Mom and I love her, she's a good Mother and it's not my relationship to try intrude on even if they are my parents but I got annoyed today when she just walked straight back in again as if nothing ever happened. I did let my annoyance get the better of me and could have probably handled the situation better, I absolutely hate upsetting people even if they're in the wrong, but part of me is telling me not to be guilty because my anger seems reasonable.

1,"AITA for selling and replacing my partner’s gift? | It went like this. 

I (23M) bought my partner (24F) a Tiffany necklace that cost me about £5000 a couple weeks ago and the package arrived the other day and I gave it to her to open. To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over £10,000+!

I told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.

I think the fact she’s still receiving a £5k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I’m not TA but she thinks differently and we’ve been arguing about it for days.

I don’t feel that it’s morally wrong to consume these products and I don’t have any superiority complex involving my diet. If someone specifically asks me about the motives behind my dietary choices, I will answer them, but I don’t go out of my way to bring it up. 

I live with my parents so they are well aware of my diet. 

Anyway, last week my mom started discussing the thanksgiving menu. She said she planned to make a roast turkey, sausage stuffing, mashed potatoes (butter/milk) and then asked me if I would make some sides as well. I told her sure, I guess I could roast some vegetables alongside some meatless chicken tenders in the oven. She got really offended and said “really? You’re going to sit at thanksgiving dinner with a frozen meal and a chip on your shoulder?” I was kind of taken off guard because my mom is more than used to me cooking dinner for myself. I typically cook with a lot whole Foods and make more elaborate salads, stews, pasta dishes, etc. but since my mom is going to be cooking all day I just figured I’d keep it simple. 

I eventually asked her, point blank, what exactly she wanted me to do. Did she want me to eat her roast turkey? Because that’s not something I want to do. She said no, she didn’t expect that, but I could at least put the effort into making myself a presentable meal for thanksgiving. 

Personally I feel she’s asking a lot considering she’s not actually helping to accommodate my dietary habits (not that I’d expect her to. But I feel I should get free reign since she isn’t).

The number of kids we planned on having was always a hot topic of discussion for us. She wanted 4+ and I said I really only wanted 2 kids, but could be persuaded into 3. She ultimately said “we will take it one kid at a time,” but she knows she is very persuasive and typically will get her way when it comes to these types of things. 

Fast forward to today. We have a three year old daughter and a 4 month old daughter (we both secretly were hoping for another girl so they could be sisters). Dealing with the newborn phase again reminds me of the effort, exhaustion, stupid marital fights, and financial burden that comes with having a baby.

In more recent conversations (when she was pregnant with our second) I told my wife that I would be willing to have three kids, because in theory it would be fun to have a bigger family. However after these last four months, I’ve realized that I love my girls and our family as is. I am perfectly happy with two kids and do not want another.

1,"AITA for calling out a girl for making revealing videos of herself and then acting offended when guys 'objectify' her? | So there's a girl at my uni that's a wannabe Tiktoker. Her posts are full of her pretty obviously showing off her body.

&#x200B;

Fyi (this becomes important later), I'm editor of our college's newspaper, and I usually am known for publishing a lot of op-eds on 'controversial' subjects. Kinda sad that this is what passes for controversial now, but whatever.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, some guys made memes of her with the caption 'girl: we're not objects. also girls: \*a picture of her thirst trapping\*. Alongside that they basically wrote a short article where they called her out basically using her body to get followers instead of actually making good content. They then posted this on a lot of campus group chats, and it spread like wildfire. 

&#x200B;

She responded back stating 'I'm just trying to have fun and take pictures and these guys are objectifying me!'. A lot of girls started supporting her, stating that she's being body shamed and objectified. A lot of guys started supporting the guys sending out the article/meme, saying it was pure facts.

&#x200B;

A lot of people were asking me to weigh in, so I did in private DMs, basically with the opinion everyone's being childish here: first off, the guys had no reason to call her out like that, so it was definitely a douchey move on their part. But c'mon, what they're saying is completely factual. The girl's out here claiming she's just taking these pictures for fun, but seriously, it's pretty obvious they're thirst trap photos. Tiktoks on a beach wearing a bikini? Sure. In workout clothes? Sure. But tiktoks that are obviously designed to show off your body? It's pretty obvious she knows what she's doing. And I stated that the people who are supporting her kind of misunderstand the message behind the post: they're claiming she got body shamed or objectified for showing off her body and having fun, but obviously the critique was that she had no good content and was just using her body for views. And that's not the same as shaming or objectification.

&#x200B;

One of the people who reached out to me to get my opinion was the girl herself. I basically told her what I typed above, and she once again got offended because I was 'defending' the guys. I mean, I clearly said they had no reason to do what they did and were being unnecessarily mean, but at the same time, their critique did make sense. I think I'm just being logical here. And she shouldn't have asked for my opinion if she didn't want it.

0,"AITA for messaging my sister to stop telling lies about me? | Hello Reddit,

As a result of the coronavirus, I \[27M\] am temporarily living with my parents and my sister \[23F\]. My sister has always been the favourite child, and is defended by my mother in all situations no matter how wrong she may be. My sister has been financially supported by our parents her whole life, and is currently the reason my father is unable to retire. I have very little respect for her. Despite this situation, I have made every effort to treat her well whenever we interact and I make sure I am not to blame for any breakdowns in the family.

Since moving home a month and a half ago, my sister has been consistently antisocial and hostile towards me. In itself, that's fine, but she then runs to my mother, in private, to spin the story around and make me a problem. My mother then comes to me to give me a stern talking to, which significantly strains my relationship with my parents. Some examples include:

\- My sister said she wanted an Xbox controller to play a game. I had a controller lying around and told hr she is welcome to borrow it, but she declined (for whatever reason). A few days later she demands the controller immediately, except I am working (remotely) and do not want to look for it now. She ran to my mother to tell her I was demanding money for the controller (make her buy it) and would not lend it to her.

\- I was making coffee in the kitchen recently. My sister comes in and aggressively asks me when it's her turn, then leaves. She was in there all of 10 seconds and told my mother I was preventing her using the kitchen 'for ages'.

I think my sister's lying, followed by my mother's validation is her way of coping with her own behaviour, which is probably easier than learning to co-exist with people. Anyway, I got tired of this cycle of bullshit and sent my sister a private message that read:

\> Stop lying about me to Mum and/or Dad. Lie about your work all you want, I don't care, but I am done with you repeatedly justifying your antisocial behaviour by lying when it involves me.

The work part relates to her lying to my parents about getting a job, which I witness consistently and hold my tongue on. When she got this message, she went to Mum and Dad and they lost their shit at me. Mum told me if I ever pull such a 'threatening stunt' again, I am to pack my shit and leave immediately. I thought I was 100% in the right, but for the first time my father is wholeheartedly siding with the rest of the family which makes me doubt myself.

1,"AITA for making a coworker return a “small” amount of money she took without asking? |  I have a female coworker named “Steph”. Steph and I have never really seemed to get along, but we work well together. We have clashed a few times over a myriad of issues, but we mostly make it through the day, and are both experienced in our field.

So anyway, one day an auditor came in for a surprise inspection, and unfortunately, I was dinged for a few items. No big deal really. My supervisor educated me on it, and I learned from my mistake. During this time, I thought of a pretty neat idea that all my teammates could participate in, so that we don’t repeat the errors I was dinged for in the first place. I would make “swear jar” type or contest in which all employees had to throw in a dollar every time a particular infraction took place. It was fun and everyone seemed receptive to it, and in about two weeks we had about $15 in the jar. It was undecided what we would do with the money, but for sure it was going to be for something fun for the whole team, like a pizza party or a team outing.

So one day I come into work and I notice that the jar was empty. I found out through some coworkers that Steph emptied the jar, and spent the money on “sodas for lunch.” Apparently, our supervisor bought everyone pizza one day, but no drinks. Steph was a little upset about this, so she used the jar money on beverages for the team. I was visibly upset about this and approached Steph the next time we worked together to ask to her to please return the money. She replied “Well, our supervisor neglected to buy us beverages for the pizza, so I used the money for that”. I reminded her that the jar money was not for that purpose, and to please return the money. Steph then replied “Once our supervisor pays me the money she owes me for the party rentals, I’ll return the jar money” (At this point I should mention that we had our Xmas party at Steph’s house. Apparently she rented some tables and chairs for the party, and our supervisor was supposed to pay her back for the rentals, but never did.) I told her that I have nothing to do with that, this is a separate issue, and she still refused.

Time goes by, she got reimbursed for the chairs, and I repeatedly asked Steph to return the money, and she still refuses. For what reason, I don’t know. I tried everything, reasoning with her, publicly shaming her, etc. Finally, after many months, (seriously) I had enough and told our supervisor about Steph taking the money, and refusing to pay it back. Finally, after a lot of back in forth, Steph returns the money. But now, quite a few people at work are upset at me for “making a big deal out of it” and getting Steph in trouble. I personally don’t care about the backlash, and it’s the principle of the matter that matters to me. Some of my coworkers even told me “I can’t believe you made such a big deal over $15” And now I am second guessing my decision to tell my supervisor.

Am I the asshole?

Today we went for lunch with my parents along with my brother and his family. When we left Lucy was in tears and is still crying now that we're home. 

I'm pleased to say Lucy got an offer from Oxbridge. She aced the interview and got a conditional offer. While she still needs to get the grades in the summer, we're sure she will seeing as she's top of all her A Level classes and often gets 100% in exams, assessments and coursework. I'm so proud of her. 

Naturally Lucy is very excited and was happily telling her grandparents and everyone else the good news. 

My brother has a son, I'll call him Harry. He wanted to do IT or something like that, but unfortunately hasn't been accepted to anywhere he applied for. Understandable he's very upset. They're looking at other universities as well as things like apprenticeships or entry level jobs. 

My brother had a word with me and Lucy, saying that while he's very happy for her, we should be a little sensitive because of Harry.

At dinner Lucy was excitedly telling everyone about her uni. We explored the place when we went for her interview and it's truly beautiful. She was talking about all the exciting things she'll get to do. I know she was getting a bit too carried away but no parent wants to stop their child when they're this excited and happy. 

Harry was staring into his food the whole time. My brother attempted to interrupt and steer the conversation away from Lucy/Oxbridge, but Lucy still had more to say. In the end Harry stood up and walked out. Lucy was still excited, but her attempt to say any more resulted in my mother snapping at her that ''we'd all heard enough'' and that she should think about someone else for once. She called her a ''spoilt and rude girl''. Lucy started sobbing and ran out. 

We left soon afterwards and Lucy was crying in the car. I am RAGING. I'm sorry that Harry didn't get the place he wanted. Truly I am, but why should that mean Lucy isn't allowed to talk about what she's achieved? Do they have any idea how hard it is to be even considered to study medicine at a university like that? 

I'm sorry, but this isn't primary school where everyone gets rewarded for ''making an effort''. Lucy succeeded and Harry didn't. Why should his failure stop her from being proud of herself?",False,False,4,5,1,2,1,4,Fairness
0,"AITA for interfering in my parents divorce? | On my phone and all that. Excuse spelling please. 

I'm in JH right now and my parents are going through a divorce. I'm not mad at that at all. As far as I've known, they've never gotten along and this was a long time coming. I live with my mom and spend every other weekend with my dad. I picked this arrangement out because even though I dislike him, my mom does think it's best for me to get along with my dad since you only get one dad and all. 

For what I've gathered eavesdropping on conversations whenever a family friend comes over, the divorce process is becoming more and more nasty with my dad claiming a lot of things against my mom that I know is false and he's apparently now asking my mom for spousal support since he got fired (he didnt actually, he quit). She tries not to show it in front of me, but I know it's taking a toll on her. 

So when I went to go visit my dad, I sort of open his phone in the middle of the night and see all these things he's planning on using against my mom. Texts claiming that she was unfaithful and abusive towards my dad and I, that she was stealing money from him, using him, and all sorts of things that I know she would never do. In all honesty, he was the one seeing another woman at one point and the one that became abusive and starting using my mom when she got promoted. To me he's trying to project all his bad qualities onto her and spin all this around so I just deleted everything and pretended that I knew nothing as to why his phone went berserk (it was an old android).

0,"WIBTA if i didn't let my girlfriend be named on the mortgage? | (Throwaway account)

I (25 M) and my girlfriend (25 F) have been together for around 4 years now. We have been living together renting out a place for 3 years now and everything has gone amazingly. We have a really strong relationship together and are looking at getting a mortgage. We are getting to the point in our relationship where we are thinking about taking our relationship to the next level with marriage, kids etc. 

I have a very well-paying job for my age in the UK (around £45K a year which can rise to easy £80K+). My girlfriend not so much, with salary of around £22K a year with not much progression. Whilst renting, I have always paid substantially more, but have never had a problem doing this due to the obvious gap in salary, and also, if anything ever went wrong in our relationship, I wouldn't lose out financially.

Anyway, I mentioned to my Dad how we are looking to get a mortgage together soon. He told me to not get a mortgage with her unless we both paid 50/50 down the middle. I told him this was not possible due to her salary and he told me to pay the full mortgage each month and take ""rent"" from my girlfriend to whatever she could afford. I asked why? So he explained how if she was named on the mortgage but only paid say £200 a month and i paid £800,  if we ever broke up, the mortgage would be split down the middle, leading to me losing out on a hell of a lot of money due to us being common law husband and wife after 2 years of living together.

I know in the past this happened to him with my Mother, and he has told me of friends that this has happened to. He said at the end of the day, it is my decision, but he was offering only a word of warning that he wishes I never have to experience.

I mentioned what my Dad told me to my girlfriend, and she said how she wouldn't be willing to do that, as if I was the only name on the mortgage and we split, I would keep all the money she has contributed to the mortgage. I understand where she is coming from, but I don't want to be financially stung in case our relationship ever goes sour.

0,"AITA for getting annoyed my fiance's best friend is constantly around? |   My fiance and I have been together 7 years. Him, his best friend, and I all met in first grade. They have been best friends ever since, while my fiance and I were friendly to each other all those years but weren't really close friends until high school (you know, we went through that girls have cooties phase until high school).

His best friend is super nice, but when I'm around he doesn't really talk to me at all and doesn't really talk about important things around me. Despite being around them for almost 20 years, I get it, they're best friends, and that's guy talk I guess. That's basically our relationship.

While they usually hang out fairly often which I don't mind, I want my fiance to hang out with his friends, whenever his best friend his single, the best friend asks to hang out CONSTANTLY. Like every Friday - Sunday for months. This has been going on the last 7 years on and off. During the week I live 1.5 hours away for school, and I come friday to see my fiance for the weekend. This gets super annoying when I come home and every weekend I have to see his best friend. Sometimes coming home from a hard week at law school/work  I just want to have some alone time with my fiance. I don't want to exclude him from seeing his bf but I cannot stand another round of this for the next few months, it's already been two months.. I try to let them hang out on their own sometimes these weekends (1. so they can talk about what they need to 2. b/c if not I am always bored b/c I’m pretty much get ignored for hours as they talk/game). Even this is annoying, obviously because i'm sacrificing my time with my fiance & because on those days my fiance works when they're going to hang out around his bf's schedule, not mine (e.g., if I have a busy saturday and we planned to hang at night and then his bf calls and wants to hang out that night, I get asked if we can hang out in the afternoon instead). I appreciate that my fiance still tries to make time for me and not exclude me entirely from the day but it still feels shitty that our plans that get made first get moved for his best friend's last minute request.

They're hanging out also constantly leaves me home alone for 6-7 hours at a time in the middle of the night, and my fiance's apartment is one in a neighborhood I'm not really familiar with, with neighbors far apart and as a petite girl kind of makes me unsettled. 

I finally said something to my fiance last night to the effect of that I appreciate him being a good friend and trying his best to accommodate us both, but I really can't deal with having to spend some much needed alone time with him, with his best friend anymore. It’s been 7 years. He got annoyed because he was trying his best to make me happy and I was coming off not appreciative.

0,"WIBTA if I don't care if I wear the same dress as another girl to prom? | I'm planning to go to my high school's junior prom this year, and I haven't picked out my dress yet. I was planning to just go this weekend and buy a dress less than $200 for the event.

&#x200B;

I don't have many regular female friends that I hang out with, but in class today the topic of prom came up and I was talking to a few classmates about buying a dress. Someone asked me if I had checked the Facebook group, and I told her that it really wasn't a big deal to me if my dress matched with someone else. All the girls were taken aback and shocked that I matching dresses wasn't a big deal to me. They then tried to explain to me how upset someone else would be if I wore the same dress as them to prom, and I really can't wrap my head around it. So what? We're wearing the same style dress, or we're wearing a similar color. Why does everyone else make it a big deal? I even asked them (rhetorically) ""what would the other girl would do, deck me? Cry?"" and to my surprise they answered yes. I can't fathom how materialistic someone has to be to react so seriously to wearing similar clothing.   


I personally just felt that if I liked a dress, and if that dress looked good on me, I should get it. I don't like that fact that I have to change my choices based on other people's choices. The other girls can wear whatever they want, and I can wear whatever I want too, so why is it such a big deal? My classmates also told me that it's ""inconsiderate"" because I'd be ""ruining their night"" or whatever. But seriously? Wearing a similar dress to some other girl is going to ruin her night? That is another level of petty, from my point of view. The only people that I'm making a conscious effort not to copy would be my two close female friends. Other than that, I don't really understand why it would be a big deal to, let's say, a student that I rarely interact with that goes to my school or something.  


Would I be an asshole if I just went out and bought whatever dress I liked, and didn't bother checking the Facebook group (since it wouldn't matter because I would just pick out a dress I liked anyway?) because there are like 150 girls part of that group and I am *seriously* not about wasting an hour to look through all of those dresses.",False,False,2,4,1,1,1,3,Fairness
0,"WIBTA for putting something in my apartment’s reserved parking spot to prevent other people from parking there? | Basically the title. I pay a pretty penny for a reserved parking spot at my apartment complex, and people KNOW that there are reserved parking spots in the lot. They know that people pay for these spots. My complex has also made it very clear that the owners of these reserved spots have the ability to tow any cars that park in the owner’s spot. 

However, all of this does not stop MULTIPLE people from parking in my parking spot. I’ve come home multiple times this week to people in my parking spot. Every time I call the towing company, but they take a bit to get to the complex and usually the people move their cars by then. That’s fine, I would kind of feel like an asshole for towing someone’s car. But I don’t want people to park in my spot in the first place, because it’s really annoying to call up the towing company any time someone parks there (which is often). 
I also want to avoid any conflicts with neighbors if I can, especially if they might damage my car in return. 

So, anyways, wibta if I put like a sign or cone or something in my spot when I go out? I’m not sure how effective it will be, but I’m just trying to think of a way to get people to not park there.

0,"AITA for not helping my girlfriend pay the mortgage on our shared apartment? | Okay, so. 

I bought this apartment (on my own) last August for 4.000.000 NOK (+/- $460k) at the time I bought it using saved up found and a bank loan. (The loan was for 3.2M or $365k)

I’d met my girlfriend when we were 18 (we’re 22 now, I was 21 when I bought the apartment) but she went to university across the country and so our relationship was long distance. She had her own place I had mine. Cool.

Now my parents are very rich, they made some great investments in the early 90’s that really paid off for them. They’re not billionaires but they have a wealthy wallet. 

My parents have been saving up money for me and my brothers to buy homes when we got old enough. They had originally decided to gift me this money after I finised my Masters degree, but due to some circumstances that aren’t relevant and I won’t go into they agreed to give it to me now, on the promise that the money went to the apartment only. 

After the money I got from my parents my loan is down to 200nok or $23k. My girlfriend (let’s call her Jane) has finished her degree, she started earlier than me and is now a fully educated High School teacher, yay! 

We’ve been talking about Jane moving in with me for a while now, and she’s gotten a job and everything. However she wants to be equals, which I absolutely love. She wants to be written into the mortgage agreement, whoch is fine to me.

Here’s the thing though I feel like the money I got from my parents is mine and mine alone. So I’ve told her that she can buy 50% of the apartment off of me, I’ll return the remaining money to my parents as the money would no longer be in the apartment as originally agreed.

Jane can’t afford to pay me 2M out of pocket and would need to get a loan.  Which I completely understand, but here’s the thing though. She wants me to help her pay back the loan. I told her I’m not going to do that as I’ve ealready paid my half. I’ll split the bills and food and everything else 50/50, but I’m not going to pay her loan for her.

- we’re both 22 (‘96) she’s older by six months
- we both work, me part time and her full time, I study as well.
- we’re both girls.
- neither her parents nor her are particularly well off, nor poor, jus kinda middleclass average.

0,"AITA For moving countries when my friend is a single mother and relying on me | So this is a throwaway

I'm just gonna jump right into the story:

I (29F) have a friend (28F) I will call Stacy here. Stacy and I have been friends for over a decade now and I do love her, I would say she is one of my best friends. Stacy got pregnant by a fling about five years ago and decided to go on with the pregnancy and keep the child, although it was clear from the beginning that the father would not be in this kid's life. He has nothing to do with the kid or Stacy.

I am childfree. I get along with kids well, but I never wanted any of my own, because I don't like how they affect everything you do in life.  
 

While Stacy was pregnant my roommate at that time moved out and Stacy asked to move in, just for about one year til she gets back on her feet. To be honest I did not like the idea of living with a newborn at all, but Stacy was desperate and I wanted to be a good friend. Stacy moved in while she was in the last trimester of her pregnancy. I helped her a lot, I was with her when she gave birth and basically helped her raise this child, who is now four years old. Stacy did not have a job at that time, so I was paying rent and for almost everything else she and the kid needed, she got a little help from the state, but in our country if you life together you are on the hook, so most expenses were covered by me. This was pretty expensive, but I pulled through, because I wanted to be a good friend. Back then I just got my degree and started working, so I earned money and we managed. I love Stacy and the kid and I always wanted to help them, but I will be honest and admit that this made me somewhat resentful. I never wanted kids and am now financing and supporting a child I never decided to have. Stacy always found a reason why she cannot move out and I let it slide.  
 

This affects me a lot, I do a lot of childcare for her, I have way less free time than I would have if there wasn’t a kid living with me and I have way more expenses, because although Stacy has a job now, I cover way more of our bills than she does.  
 

I always had this dream of moving to a specific country and decided I will do it as soon as this situation we are in right now allows it. Last week I talked to Stacy about it and told her. Since this was always my plan I expected her to somehow understand. She flipped at me. She cried and screamed how I cannot leave her and the kid, how she cannot raise a kid on her own, how she does not want to be a single mother, how she cannot pay all the bills. She said I am running away from responsibilities. This made me so angry. This is not my kid, she IS a single mother, I never wanted a child and this child should not be my responsibility.

  In September my partner was in an accident. A week later he came home and absolutely demanded I sell my car. He was extremely clear that it was to be sold. My car was definitely running but not in the best shape of its life. But I was still driving it. And I had been going back and forth about weather I wanted to sell or fix. I was currently on wanting to fix, even going as far as asking him how hard it would be to fix ourselves, watching a few videos about it, and looking at prices for parts. He was aware of my feelings, I involved him totally.

  Well exactly one day after selling my beloved car he comes home and tells me hes not able to work anymore as hes in too much pain. I wasnt aware he was in that much pain as he made no effort to get looked at prior to this convo. Hes said hes been in similar pain for years and made no effort to get checked out before all this despite having excellent health coverage. He only says hes in more pain. I found it odd that it was so conveniently after I've just received quite a bit of money for my car. But I did not mention my feeling about that at the time, but I have now. But he promised that I could just get another car. 

  But as time went on and I tried to actually get another car, he shot down every car I suggested. Right from a decent used car from a dealership to craigslist and facebook jalopies. All this is happening while I'm slowly depleting the money I have for another car by supporting our household because I dont make enough to support everyone on my paycheck alone. Before this all happened the expenses were split pretty 50/50. Hes always known that I couldnt support us all by myself. So in theory it'd have been very bad for him to be out of work. Had I not sold my car.

Because now he needs the car we do have. While I'm left out in the literal cold to bum rides home from work and uber, which is further depleting my savings. 

  So when I asked if we'd be getting me another car, he blew up. He was even calling me mean names. After awhile I couldnt take the mindfuck anymore and started calling him names back, I do admit. He said I'm being greedy for asking and I should just save up on my own if I want another car. How I was the one that had wanted to sell my car.

I was a bit upset about this but tried not to make a big deal about it as he’d been invited to the late reception which seemed fair. Until I got to the wedding and saw that all my cousin’s other 2nd and 3rd cousins etc (I’m 1 of 3 first cousins) had plus ones who were in no sense “close” to the bride or groom. It then became apparent that other plus ones coming to the later reception had been sent proper invitations, my boyfriend had been sent a link to their wedding website with the message “you’re welcome to attend”. 

Maybe I was being over sensitive but it just seemed like such a slap in the face. Other relatives - also my age and with similar relationship lengths - were allowed plus ones. The bride herself had only been dating the groom for 4 years at this point so excluding my boyfriend from a family event seemed so dismissive of our relationship to me.

I haven’t seen my cousin since then - not because of this event (there was no fallout) we just haven’t connected since.

0,"AITA for saying there's nothing wrong with my brother? | I was diagnosed with Celiac disease a while ago. My celiac disease is relatively mild as far as Celiac disease goes, but it still causes problems for me. For anybody who doesn't know, Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease which attacks your small intestine whenever you consume gluten. If I have any gluten at all, it compromises my immune system. I try not to be overdramatic, but it's important that I don't consume it. Ever since I had to stop eating it, my brother is suddenly sure that he too is gluten intolerant. He claims that he gets stomach aches from it, but the only occasions of that happening is when he eats too many pastries, he has no problem with bread or pasta or anything. He always announces it in public places, making everyone bend over backwards for him. I remember going out to a restaurant for my birthday, and him crying the whole time because ""he doesn't trust the food"" (and I'm not joking, he actually cried). When we go to family gatherings, people will make gluten free food, and he always insists on eating it, even if there isn't enough left over. He literally takes almost all of it. Whenever desert comes around, he'll ""forget"" about the gluten and eat all he wants. There were even times where he ate food that he thought was gluten free and be fine, only to realize it had gluten and miraculously feel ill. He has no symptoms of Celiac disease either. I told him that if he has concerns to go get a blood test to investigate, but he refuses to see a doctor of any kind because ""he shouldn't need a blood test to eat what he wants"". Now, I'm undergoing further tests, they think I could also be lactose intolerant. Suddenly, he can't eat dairy either, or sugar, or vegetable oil, yet every time someone pulls out desert, he has no problems whatsoever, and steals more food made specifically for me. My mother is completely on his side, ""you didn't care when you were first diagnosed"". When I was first diagnosed, I ""splurged"" a lot, but I was young and I didn't understand the health consequences that could come from it. Because of it, my health has been negatively affected forever. My brother constantly brings it up, because ""I'm just mad because I want all the food to myself"". I finally snapped one day when my brother insisted on eating the pasta (gluten free) and didn't leave anything for me. My dad brought home doughnuts (gluten) and he ate it just fine. I told him, rather loudly, ""hey, I don't have anything to eat because of you, could you maybe put aside your ego and think of other people for once? There's nothing wrong with you!"" My mom got really angry at me, and everyone sided with my brother, further stroking his massive ego. I told him over and over again ""if you go to the doctor we won't have a problem"" but he refuses and plays the victim. Am I the ahole for snapping at him?",False,False,4,5,2,2,3,4,Fairness

1,"AITA for refusing to switch sides of the bed with pregnant wife? | My wife is about 12 weeks pregnant with our second child and recently she asked me to switch sides of the bed with her. I've slept on the right side of the bed for as long as I can remember, every house, every relationship, back to when I was a kid living at home with my parents. Right now we're in the process of buying a home so we're living in a small two bedroom double-wide. The two bedrooms and the bathroom are the end of the hall on the left side of the house in a sort of U-shape. Our bedroom is small and from my wife'e side of the bed it's maybe a ten step trip, unobstructed. From my side it's probably about seven or eight steps. Not really a huge difference, and on my side there's a large dresser.

I politely told my wife I wasn't going to switch. She got huffy with me and told me I obviously didn't have any concern for her condition or our unborn child and I didn't care about making her life easier. I pointed out that when she was pregnant with our older child we lived in a small two story apartment where the bathroom was on the ground floor and the bedrooms were on the second floor and she never had any trouble with that, so why is this any different? She's not high-risk, she's having moderate-to-light morning sickness that has been lightening up over the last couple weeks. She's chasing our toddler around with no problems. I'm sympathetic to her situation, I really am, of course I want my wife-pregnant or not-to be comfortable and happy but I don't see how this small change is going to make a lick of difference.

I don't ask for much. We're an equal relationship as far as childcare, housework, financial, work, etc. I don't sit on my butt drinking beer and watching her do everything, I get up and do my part and then some. It's what keeps us happy and our relationship good. All I'm asking for is to keep my side of the bed. But my wife insists that if I don't give her my side of the bed that it means I hate her and the unborn baby. No amount of my trying to show and tell her how much I care about her and the baby will change her mind.

Another reason I don't want to switch are because my wife has to have a fan on when she sleeps and the only place we can keep the fan is on her side of the bedroom. We only have two outlets in the bedroom, the kind where each outlet has two sets of plugs, one on top, one on the bottom. One is behind the top of the bed and the other is on the wall beneath the window on her side. I'd be too cold. My side of the bed is just the right distance to be comfortable. I'd need extra blankets and my wife says it'll make her too hot so I can't do that. And her side is right next to the window and I have trouble with bright light when I first wake up, I get headaches.  

I don't know what to do. I know this is a really stupid hill to die on and honestly I'm ready to give up, but I'm still just really confused, like why is this a big deal? AITA because I just want to keep my side of the bed?",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness
0,"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...

I have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is ""awful"" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that ""It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake"" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.

0,"AITA for wanting to call out my non-Veteran brother on Veteran’s Day | I have a brother who joined ROTC in college over 20 years ago, but didn’t take a scholarship. He went to basic training over one summer, but then got kicked out of ROTC pretty quickly for grades. Since he didn’t take any scholarship money, he didn’t have a service commitment. This is about as much as I know about the situation, because I was younger when all this happened and it was never really discussed. 

Cut to present day. Veterans Day is coming up and you would have thought he stormed the Beaches of Normandy with all of his social media posts about Veterans Day and what it means to him to be a Veteran. He saved his one picture from boot camp graduation and makes it his profile picture every year. He even goes to his kid’s school’s Veterans Day breakfast. 

This is so bad, I know. And our other brother was actually deployed to Iraq, which infuriates him. I want to tell non-Veteran brother to knock it off but evidently when our Dad said something, he went off on him about how he is a veteran because he “served”, as in went to a couple weekend training things after boot camp for a year. 

Am I the asshole for wanting all this to stop or should I just let it go? He isn’t going around trying to get benefits and I don’t think it’s something he is putting on his resume.

0,"AITA Parents bought younger sister with serious issues a 25k car for Christmas while all I got was a phone case, been needing a car for a couple years, parents promised one, but gave her one instead | In my family there are 2 kids (sister and I) and my parents. Christmas was coming up and I’ve been wanting a car for about a year now because I’ve recently gotten my Green P’s (Australian thing that you can get when you’re older than 18). My parents have mentioned in the past the idea of me paying for half and they’ll cover the other half of a car under total 10k AUD, I can afford this as I’ve saved most of my money from the 2 jobs I’ve kept since I was 14, so no biggie. I’ve also been relying on my mum to drive me to work for the last 4 years, so it was a smart move on their end rather then driving me the 30 mins each way every shift I’ve got.

My sister has just turned 17, which is when you can get your red P’s in Australia, shes never had a job and has no money saved whatsoever. I love her a lot but she’s made some questionable decisions toward her future lately, but that’s a seperate story. My parents haven’t seemed to care as much as they probably should have about these things, and are acting like everything’s normal and all good.

With Christmas coming up at the time and my birthday in early January I thought this might be the time my parents get me that car I’ve wanted for the last year, as they’ve mentioned this idea for the last couple months. I’m obviously excited the week leading up to Christmas wondering what type of car they’ve bought or what they’re looking at. 

I wake up Christmas Day around 10am to the sound of my younger sister crying but in a happy way. I’m excited for her as she’s obviously gotten something she’s wanted, I walk downstairs and no ones at the Christmas tree, but a present with my name is sitting there. I figure I’ll come back to it after I find my parents. Check the front door and it’s wide open, walk out to the drive way to see a brand new blue Hyundai i30 sitting in the driveway with a big ribbon on the front (around 25k), my sister is at the side of it crying with my parents arms around her. I ask who it’s for and my parents tell me her, I probably could have handled this better but I stormed back into the house, closed my door and stayed in there for the rest of the day, didn’t go with my family to see everyone else for Christmas because of how annoyed I was.

My parents asked me why I did that when they got home, so I asked them why they bought her a car before me, who’s older, willing to pay half, had a job, goes to school and has a stable plan for the future. They don’t have an answer to that one so they just stay quite and after a couple of minutes of awkward silence they walk out. By this point I forgotten about the present they left under the tree downstairs, so I walk down to open it, and it’s a new phone case from eBay, something I had no use for, I can't get over what they've done.

I 'John' (fake name) (24m) have recently (last 8-10 months) started performing stand up comedy at small/open mic venues. Anywhere that will give me 8 minutes on stage basically lol. Having done it and felt that rush of making a room full of people laugh, well I'm hooked and have basically decided that this is my dream and I am going to shoot my shot because, if I fail, at least I tried...right?

Anyway, I've been tweaking my act constantly and recently have hit on a rich vein of material via a kind of stage 'persona' I am cultivating of a sort of downbeat, grumpy guy talking about life from a kind of frustrated, grumpy, not so self aware, loner type persona. Nothing too seriously dark but the stuff I've written is really starting to hit home with audiences and I've started to crush the rooms (albeit very small venues) I've been playing in. 

Well, enter my friend 'Kevin' (fake name) who I've know since I was 12. He is kind of a hermit, works in IT and doesn't really leave home much to socialize. And that's cool with me. He's a good guy, very smart and funny and I genuinely like him. 

Well, miracle of miracles, I finally manage to get Kevin to come to one of my shows after months of trying and he just kind of sits there with a blank expression during my set. Mind you this is among a crowd who were laughing quite loud so it was very noticeable that the big dude in the Hawaiian shirt was not laughing...at all. Fair enough, he might just not have found me that funny and that's ok.

After the show Kevin blanks me and leaves the venue. 3 days later I hear from a mutual friend that Kevin is ""disgusted"" that I've ""taken his essence"" *(his actual words)* and made a stage show out of him! Now I'm like 'fuck me, that's utter nonsense'.....I wrote my own material and did not think about him for one second. Shit, if I'm taking inspiration from anybody it's people like Larry David, Doug Stanhope and Dave Chappelle.

Now Kevin wants me to name check him before my shows and ""give thanks"" (again his exact words) for him inspiring me. My first thought is to tell him to fuck off but I honestly don't know if I've been a dick here.

0,"AITA for smoking cigarettes near a daycare group of about 20 kids? | So I live on a college campus in an apartment building. The building has an area with picnic tables and grills and ash trays behind it.

I'm a smoker. (Flthy habit I know, but this post isnt about that so please dont tell me I should quit, I know I should quit. I'm working on it, but life is stressful right now.) I usually go out back behind my building and smoke at one of the tables by the ash trays a few times a day.

Recently a daycare for students' kids started bringing the group (~20 kids) around the building I live in and having picnics/playtime on a grassy hill behind the smoking area. Important note: The grassy hill is far enough away that the kids would not be smelling the smoke, however they can see me smoking.

Yesterday one of the daycare leaders approached me and asked me to smoke elsewhere. The problem is, there are very few designated smoking areas on campus and the next closest one to my building is about 1/3 of a mile away. However, the grassy hill the daycare has been taking the kids to is not at all unique. There are grassy areas everywhere, and there are even playgrounds and picnic tables all over the place. They could easily walk a minute or two further away and not even be able to see me, and if they did that they'd even be by a playground for the kids which they currently are not doing for some reason.

I told the daycare leader that I lived in the building and where I was sitting was a designated smoking area, but she still insisted I go somewhere else. I asked them why they chose that particular hill for picnic time with the kids when there are dozens of other places to go, and she didn't have an answer. Just told me I was being disrespectful and putting the kids at risk by continuing to smoke. I just kind of shrugged and didn't move or say anything else until she walked away.

Today an email was sent out to all the people in my building and surrounding buildings asking that people please be respectful of the kids in the daycare. I can't help but feel it was directed at me, and now I'm wondering, am I an asshole for refusing to budge? My reasoning is this: 1) I have every right to sit and smoke in the designated smoking area where I live, 2) the next closest smoking area is not at all close, 3) the smoke doesn't even reach them, its just that they can see me smoking, and 4) the daycare has countless other places they can go if it really bothers them that much.

When I started, this was all spelled out clearly, and I'm in a position where it wasn't a problem. The only 'benefit' I get is the ability to take (unpaid) time off whenever I want, make my own hours, and work from home a few days a week. At first, I had a limited role, worked 25 hours per week, and it was no issue to be as flexible as possible. My boss made it perfectly clear that she didn't care when I worked, as long as I got things done.

Since I've started, we've grown. From the full staff being just myself and the president, we now also have a part time assistant, and an intern. My responsibilities have grown, and I'm now in the office 4 days a week, and WFH one. I'm working more like 35 hours, and obviously cannot be quite as flexible as I was before. I get my work done, and have grinned and borne it as the president keeps giving me work I don't want that takes me away from my main responsibilities. To note, I still have no benefits.

Recently, I made an appointment, and put it on the calendar about 3 weeks in advance. I specified that I'd be WFH that morning and afternoon to accommodate. My intern was not scheduled to be in that day. This has been pretty standard, and I didn't think anything of it. However, the president just tried to have a talk with me saying that now I should make any appointments or personal things that would pull me away from work on my WFH day, and need her permission to take any time on days I am scheduled to be in the office. I waffled, but I'm honestly a bit upset. 

It frustrates me that after dumping work on me that she knows I don't want, and telling me I'm only getting a cost of living raise this year despite more and more responsibility that the president is now also trying to limit my only benefit. She's also not bothering to try to provide any sort of alternative compensation or benefit.

Short of one emergency, I've never taken time off without ample notice, I am mindful of my responsibilities, and don't abuse the flexibility. We've had the additional staff since last spring, so I don't know why my taking any time has suddenly become problematic to her.

0,"WIBTA for filing an HR complaint against my boss for religious discrimination? | I live in the Bible belt and work in a retail store in a customer-facing position. My GM likes to make holidays fun and encourages us to wear small accessories each holiday, like leprechaun hats on St. Patrick's Day or bunny ears on Easter, Santa hats on Christmas, etc.


I have somehow managed to not be scheduled for Halloween the past two years so Halloween accessories never came up. I sent an email at the beginning of the month asking if Halloween accessories were allowed to be worn to all 6 of the managers in my store, including the GM. Every one of them responded with some version of ""I don't see why not"" except the GM, who was on vacation. I did email him solely to ask when he came back, but he didn't answer it and then left again for a business trip.


Well I was scheduled yesterday so I wore a witch hat and wore my pentacle necklace I usually wear inside my shirt outside of it, and I had a pen shaped like a witch's broom with pentacles carved into the ""handle"" of the broom. Within a few moments of me getting there I was asked by the GM to remove my hat and put the pen away and tuck my necklace back inside my shirt because ""it had offended customers"" and it ""wasnt allowed"". I asked why not because not a lot of people in my store dressed up, but another employee was wearing a unicorn horn, one had cat ears and another was wearing a Bob Ross wig and had a fake paint palette, and one had fake vampire teeth and contacts. The GM just said he didn't approve of ""certain aspects"" of my costume and to take everything off because customers complained. 


I am Wiccan (no I don't actually think I can do magic, before anyone asks) and I love Halloween because it's a religious holiday for me, and the pentacle is a religious symbol. My GM knows that, I'm not obnoxious about it but when asked about religion I didn't lie. At Christmas I wear a crown of berries and holly instead of a Santa hat, on Easter I wear a flower circlet instead of bunny ears, etc., so he's never cared before until I outwardly showed a symbol of my religion. I asked other managers if customers complained and they said no, they hadn't heard anything. 


 I want to report my GM to corporate HR for discrimination, because I was the only employee targeted for ""an inappropriate costume"" and I feel like I was targeted for displaying religious symbols. A couple of my co-workers have said I'm overreacting and to just ""get over it"" because Wiccan symbols make people uncomfortable.

0,"AITA for not taking my brother to school, if it results in me being late to school? | So I just had a very infuriating conversation with my mother this morning about how she will start punishing me for not taking my brother to school, even if it makes me late. So let me explain a little bit:

My brother takes the bus every morning and that bus comes to his bus stop around 7:15am every morning. He has a tendency to miss the bus due to him being very slow to get ready in the morning. Now we live around 3 minutes from the school, but it easily adds up to 5 or even 10 minutes because of the awful traffic that we encounter when getting to school. So the latest we can leave without either of us being late is around 7:20 because the middle school (my brother) and the high school (me) that we respectively go to are across the street from each other. I park fairly far away from the entrance to my school so it’s another 7-10 minute walk to get to my class from my car. So if I leave around 7:20 with my brother, I am able to drop him off at around 7:25, and then I get to my spot around 7:28. And then I finally get to my class around 3 minutes before the bell rings (class starts around 7:40). 

So this morning it was around 7:25 before I even leave the house so I don’t have enough time to take him to school and also not making me late. So I had to leave the house. Then I get a few very pissed off texts from my mother saying how I should have waited around for my brother and taken him to school, even if it made me late to class. 

So I am wondering if I am being an asshole by not waiting for my brother to leave the house, even if it causes me to be late to class? Obviously if we can both make it on time, then I would be more than happy to take him, but it seems like I have to sacrifice my attendance for him being so slow getting ready in the morning.

So am I the asshole?

We currently live is a 2 story house with a large yard/pool. When we first moved to this house we did not have kids and both worked. I did the yard/pool and she maintained the house, and I would help. We would randomly hire a landscaper or house cleaner depending on how busy we were but generally handled much of it on our own. We are about to move. We are upsizing our house but it will be a 1 level, however we are downsizing our yard and maintenance will be much less. When we first decided to list our current house due to me working, we hired a landscaper and pool guy to maintain both on a regular basis to make sure it looked good if a potential buyer wanted to see the house. For the most part we still maintained the house together. 

My wife asked that when we move since we will not need a landscaper/pool guy can we hire a cleaner to come monthly/biweekly. With all the changes we can certainly afford it, however I feel like we should not need to. I completely understand a stay at home mom with 2 kids under 5 is hard work. And I appreciate all she does for us and our kids to keep them active and healthy. However, I do feel like house cleaning is part of the job being a stay at home parent. I do cook 75% of the time, since I enjoy it and generally know how to cook a wider range of foods. With that I generally do dishes and keep the kitchen clean. She does do laundry 90%.

Now, normally when he's using something my parents bought, I have no control over it so I don't care if he's using it. But recently I bought a PC with my own money that I have saved up over the past few months from my part time job. I refuse to let him use it because I hate the fact that he is constantly relaxing at home and using our stuff while we are out here trying to make a living. Whenever he ask to use/play something I bought, I refuse and we both start an argument.

He then usually calls my parents like a little kid and complains that I don't allow him to touch my stuff. My parents then call me and ask if I can just share my stuff with him. I explain to them my reason for not wanting him to touch my stuff, which is what I said above.

I feel like my parents have spoiled him too much because they kept giving in to my brother's wants. Two years ago, my brother wanted my parents to subscribe to a football channel to watch the 2018 World Cup (he's a football fan) and promised to get a job when they buy it for him. They bought it for him and my brother did actually find a job, but quit after a month, and even admitted that he lied to my parents that he will get a job just so my parents will subscribe the channel for him.

We’re still friends, but we kind of diverged. He found early success in his career and dating life, while I’m still single and doing entry level work. He started dating this model since last summer. I met her at a New Year’s party when Charley brought her. I knew about her since before Charley even started dating her. I follow a lot of models on Instagram and Charley’s girlfriend was one of them, but I wouldn’t call her a celebrity among the general public, especially in a city full of stars like LA. But anyways, I found her to be extremely pretty and introduced myself as a fan and asked her for a photo together. Charley took it. I respected their relationship and didn’t post that photo on social media, but rather used it as my phone wallpaper. She’s eye candy and it motivates me to work hard like Charley so hopefully one day I can call someone like her my girlfriend. She’s really sweet. Charley’s really lucky. I try my best to not be a creep around her or when discussing her with Charley. 


Yesterday, I had dinner with just Charley. We had a good time catching up. We didn’t talk much about his girlfriend until he noticed my phone wallpaper as we were waiting for the check. I wrote down a reminder to change that before meeting up with Charley yesterday, but I forgot about it. He asked me why I had that photo as my wallpaper. I was a little embarrassed and hesitated to speak for a few seconds. I just told Charley what I have already told him before, that I was a fan of her before they even started dating, but I respect their relationship and he doesn’t have anything to worry about. Charley never ridiculed me for not being good with women, but yesterday he told me that of course he doesn’t have to worry about me because a guy like me would never get a girl like her. I was really hurt by his words. I told Charley that he might be tall, good-looking, and make a lot of money, but he’s a huge dickhead for saying that.

0,"AITA for not hiring someone based on how they treated me in high school? | A little bit of background. I am the sous chef of a small farm to table restaurant about 30 miles from where I grew up. The executive chef an I have a system for reviewing applicants; I conduct the first interview, and if I think they have potential, I set up a second interview with the executive. We have worked together for years and he trusts my judgement.

Last week, I had an interview with a name I immediately recognized, lets call him Jake. Jake was in my high school graduating class, and for the good part of junior and senior year he made my life hell. Now I wasn't particularly popular in high school, but I was never bullied, except by this guy. His favorite thing to do would be to loudly insult me in front of his friends, then force me to leave because I wasn't cool enough to be around his cool friends. This happened at lunch, gym, assemblies, and sporting  events. I distinctively remember one football game where he kept telling everyone how much weight I had gained recently, calling me a fat fuck and making me sit in the bleachers on the other side of the field. I still think about that stuff today to be honest.

Fast forward 10 years later, and he is sitting in front of me interviewing for a job. I decide to not bring this up, and he never mentions any of it. His interview actually went really well, and he had a pretty good resume. But before we even start talking, I know I am not going to hire this guy.  I finish the interview, tell him I will be in touch, and he leaves. I later call him and tell him we accepted someone else for the position. 

As i was driving home I started to feel a little guilty. This guy was definitely qualified, and we don't see too many applicants being in a small town. High school was 10 years ago, I know I was a different person then, and maybe Jake has changed for the better.

0,"AITA for refusing to help my mom on this project? | Over the past three weeks my sister and I've been painting my parent's house. We started in the dining room then moved to the large entryway/living room area which requires us the work on scaffolding as the walls are so high. it's also a really awkward room with lots of ornate moulding. It's been a grueling few weeks and my mom gets really angry whenever we ask for a break. We've had 2 breaks in this time, and she still brings it up as us being lazy. 

I started this project being really upfront with her: I want to be able to fit in reasonable stopping points between projects. Aka I'm starting this project ONLY and once I'm done I want a break to focus on myself for a few days before moving on to the next project. I don't mind doing these projects but I want to spend time for myself too.

I said that because she likes to start projects then feverishly push people to finish them. Then she starts another project in the middle of the first project, then another, so the cycle of work never really ends, and god forbid you take a break with something unfinished. It's also a really chaotic method of working. I prefer doing things orderly as it keeps my own anxiety down.

Well, mom decided to start painting the kitchen (of course.) She claimed it was just her own project and that we don't have to help her. Thing is she can't do much because of her health, so she constantly asks us to stop what we're doing and help her. I told her over and over again that I'm not willing to start on the kitchen until I finish the front room. She seemed to relent with that at first.

This morning though mom came to me and said, ""hey can you ask your sister to help me tape around the cabinets?"" I was hesitant because my sister is even less enthusiastic about these projects than I am. 

Of course my sister refused because it's just too much work right now, but mom flew off the handle. She was calling us lazy and ungreatful. she was throwing insult after insult, and denying any of the work we've done so far.

*""You only do these things because I'll scream at you if you don't!""*

We had a similar fight before when my mom and I disagreed on the exact method for painting the dining room (paint one half of the room, than the other. Moving the furnature in between)

My oldest sibling who doesn't live here anymore was trying to give me advise about it and said, ""Treat this like an improv show. You always want to say *yes, but* but that's the same as saying *no*. Try saying *yes, and* instead.""

I just don't understand her logic though. While ""yes and"" can prevent a fight in the short term, it has been wrecking my mental health trying to keep up with mom's demands. if I say ""yes and when would be a good time to start?"" she'll say ""right now"". If I ask for a break I'm crewed out unless I literally have a panic attack. If I don't put my foot down about her parrallel projects, then I'll start having a mental break down.

0,"AITA for not wanting to forgive my brother for years of mistreatment? | I (18f) have an older brother (23m) and our relationship is extremely rocky. He dropped out after about a year and a half of JuCo and didn’t tell anyone. Which, while I don’t judge him for dropping out, I have a big issue with him keeping it from everyone.

l have an issue because while he was dropped out and lying, both my parents had surgery. (Summer of 2019). So, most of the housework fell on me. The biggest one was taking care of my other brother (20m) who has autism. All while I was starting my first semester at college (thankfully I still live at home while at uni). It was a tough time. Since my brother was lying about school, he would leave the house early in the morning (6am) and wouldn’t be back till late (9-10pm, when my brother and parents are already asleep).

I was already frustrated with doing everything on my own, but at that point, I didn’t know he was lying. I was more upset that he wasn’t appreciative of me at all, and seemingly didn’t give a shit about my parents, especially my mom, who went through a very invasive and painful surgery. He also was always around the house with an extremely bad attitude, snapping at me, barely even speaking to me and basically treating me like a nuisance, like he was a teenager again.

This treatment and pushing of responsibilities onto me is nothing new. Growing up, when my parents left for a weekend, he would “watch” my brother and I, but he would completely ignore us or talk to us as if we were the most annoying people on the planet. Didn’t do wonders for my self esteem and, once again, I took care of my other brother on my own. The treatment never left.

After he finally came clean about dropping out, he also said he was struggling with depression and didn’t want to tell anyone, because “nobody would understand”. I was upset by this, since both my parents have PTSD, and my mother and I struggle with anxiety and depression. Our family has been through a lot and we’re very open. While I don’t fault him for being scared to talk about these things, I get upset when he acts as though he is the only one struggling, and thus has an excuse to be rude and mean to us. Like he’s using his depression as an excuse to not help around the house and just be a mean person to us.

Recently, he did something stupid and almost lost his girlfriend. I’m not sure, but I guess it flipped a switch in him and he’s been acting way nicer and doing nice things. He actually talks to my brother and I like people and is being honest.

I feel like it’s too late for us. I’ve never felt like he’s loved me as a sister and never treated me with respect. I don’t feel like I need to forgive him. But then I feel guilty because I’m sure his therapist is why he’s turning over a new leaf like this. I feel like if I don't open up, I’ll be stifling his growth.

My boyfriend is a personal trainer and I teach dance so one ""bedroom"" is a home gym. And we're not talking hand-weights here, but big, huge, heavy machines like treadmills that had to be put up after getting them through the door, as well as a pole that is bolted into the ceiling and floor right in the middle of the room. We both use this room for at least an hour or two a day and due to having different routines our workout times rarely overlap.

The other bedroom is an office for both of us. We have separate desks, separate stacks of files, and need space because we both regularly have to take work calls or video calls with clients, and sometimes my clients even come to the house, and I see them in the office.

The third ""bedroom"" referenced in the title is the attic. When we bought the place we realised we needed the space so we did up the attic into a functional bedroom in order to have the gym and office spaces.

My sister lived with her boyfriend until last night, when she found out he was cheating on her. Other sister lives in a studio flat, and our parents passed away, so that leaves me as the only person who can take her in. She called me, in tears, begging for a place to sleep, saying it'll only be until she finds a new place. I talked to my boyfriend and we said she could stay here. The sofa isn't a sofa-bed or anything, just a regular old fabric sofa, so I got my sister a blanket and pillow. She looked a bit confused but I was tired and just sort of said ""help yourself to food, goodnight"".

This morning she asks why she slept on the sofa as opposed to one of the ""spare rooms"". I tell her the rooms aren't spare. She then asks what's in them and I show her. She then asks if we can't move a desk or a treadmill to make way for her to put up a blow up mattress. I told her that wasn't really feasible. She asked to just try and I gave a firm no because I'm not about to mess with what is essentially work equipment.

She's now making a fuss, saying that she's going through a tough time rn and I'm not being as empathetic as I probably could be. She's apparently told our sister, who agrees that we could just get rid of 1 desk or move a treadmill just until she moves out, but we don't want to.

I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me.

They offer to drop you off/pick you up from somewhere while your car is being serviced. I've had them drop me/pick me up from my house at least two or three times before without issue. In the past the guy who drove me was older (past middle-age? married with older kids etc.) but this time it was a guy who looked a bit younger than me (I'm late 20s).


So that same afternoon, after I'd collected my car and everything was done with, I notice I have a friend request on Facebook. I don't recognise the name but when I look at the profile I recognise the guy from the photo and his workplace is listed there. It's the young guy from the car dealership who dropped me off/picked me up for my car service. This makes me a bit uncomfortable. 


We only made small talk while he was driving me, about the weather etc. and I told him where I worked. I'm a quiet and introverted person so I would have been happy to sit in silence but maybe the guys who do this job are told to make small talk or just naturally want to chat, I don't know. I wasn't being overly friendly or at all flirty. I told him my first name and he knows where I live because that's where he dropped me/picked me up from. (I'm assuming he was told or got my surname as part of his job, that specific detail I don't care about.)


In a scenario where the employee and the customer were getting on really well and one of them asked the other about hanging out or a friend request and the other person said yes - fine. That doesn't seem out of bounds.


But like I said, I feel a bit uncomfortable with this. I don't think he's a murderer or anything and I don't think this is bad enough that he deserves to be fired, but I think someone should tell him that this isn't okay.


I saw this as a normal customer interaction. WIBTA? Am I overreacting?

1,"AITA for dumping my coffee on the Monopoly board? | I know the title probably makes me sound bad but if anything I feel like maybe everybody sucks in this situation.

Christmas Eve with my family always involves lots of drinking and board games. We were all playing Monopoly and teaching my little cousins how to play - for reference I’m 21 and my cousins in this scenario were 8 & 10. 

I was against them playing at all because it’s obviously a really complex game and we all get very competitive. I didn’t want to have to slow down to explain shit.

Anyway they couldn’t get the grasp of the hotel situation and after like 1.5 hours of constantly explaining when/how you use hotels they still didn’t get it. I admit I was getting a little cranky so I switched from gin to coffee to try and calm down.

The final straw was when my 8 year old cousin got sent to jail and refused to move his piece there. I raised my voice and said very sternly that he had to, he started pouting and said no and threw his play piece against the wall.

At this I snapped and basically poured out my coffee all over the board. It was an impulsive thing I admit and I know it was immature.

The thing is my family all freaked out on ME and they’re completely ignoring the fact that my cousin started it when he threw his game piece.

I’ve apologized for my part but I’m pissed that nobody’s holding him accountable. I’m still getting snide remarks from people and it’s like they haven’t disciplined him for his role at all.

0,"WIBTA for outing my best friend as scammer and possibly messing up her livelihood? | First post here, please be kind. 

I've known my friend Joyce for over about 10 years. We met through a mutual friend and just clicked and became very close to a point of calling each other sisters.  I found out she's a liar. It was always small white lies I didn't care about such as her age, things about her kids, past, etc. I noticed the stories she told didn't make sense as her kids contradicted her. 

The scam: She got into making reborn babies. She made/sold them for couple of years and was doing well according to her. She claimed one of her daughters messed up her Etsy account and couldn't use etsy. I had an account with hundreds of ratings and offered to let her use it to sell her reborn babies. She took over my etsy and started getting a lot of orders very fast as Christmas is only few months away. Despite getting large amount of orders, I noticed she was not working on the dolls. I asked her and she said she ordered the supplies. She was also selling on her website.

Long story short, by early December, she had over 70 Christmas dolls to make and send and she had completed ONE. I helped her organize the Christmas orders and made everything easier for her.

Somehow all the dolls were out by Christmas in less than 10 days. The quality was severely lacking to say the least. Myself and my DH, her husband and even her DIL helped her for the last week. I was working with her 18-20 hours a day and my DH was helping make some parts she never ordered. 

After Christmas, I helped her organize again fshe stopped sending out any orders after January. Some disputes were open due to quality of the dolls. And because she made so much etsy required SSN or tax ID and she used her business tax ID number so it's not tied to me at all.

I found out between the Christmas orders and ordered that were never sent, etsy refunded about $36k to buyers and is now owed to etsy. Few weeks ago, I found out she was getting letters from the AG office and got curious and looked up her original website. Turns out she had a lot of people on BBB complaining of never receiving orders. I checked BBB on other websites she had and same thing. People were saying she would deliberately tell them 90 days or 120 days to get them out and by then, the dispute timeframe was over on whatever platform they used to pay. Aside from etsy, she scammed another $15k minimum and these are only the ones on BBB. 

She talked about a group on book of faces for scammers that  is very active and large and I want to out her there. This was all 2017-2018 but I know she did some shady things last Christmas too, just don't have as much info as I do for 2017. This may mess with her livelihood.

We are about as American as it gets, and my mom and dad have very very little cultural ties back home to India. They are openly atheist, have white collar jobs and so their mannerisms, lifestyles, values, are all more american than Indian. 

Now they speak ‘conversational’ Hindi, just enough to get by, but me and my siblings basically only know how to count from 1-10 and maaaybe the names of a few animals. We’ve never learnt the language whether your opinion on that is good or bad, it just is what it is. We were only spoken to in English growing up. 

My best friend of 12+ years has a cousin who I saw on and off growing up. I’m seeing a lot more of him now because my best friends mom is getting remarried and it’s going to be a huge affair. So he’s been coming over whenever I’m with my best friend to help with things like moving stuff, picking up items, etc.

0,"AITA for making plans to avoid going to my mom’s 4th wedding reception? | I [28M] have considered going to Ohio for Thanksgiving this year to spend it with my dad [56M] and extended family. I live in Tennessee and my dad moved back to Ohio a few years ago to be near his parents and siblings as they age, plus my sisters and I are all grown and scattered about. So I’ve seen my dad maybe 7-8 times in the last 3 years, and even though we aren’t super close, we get along and I love the old man.

We also have one big thing in common: football. I grew up watching Ohio State games with my dad every fall. We’d always grill out and have a great time, but I haven’t been able to watch a single game with him since he moved away. Because of this, and upon discovering the Ohio State-Michigan game (biggest game of the season for either team) falls on Thanksgiving weekend, I thought that would be a perfect time for my daughter [6F] and I to make a trip up.

This past Friday rolls around and my younger sister Liddy [20F] calls me to chat. I hadn’t made any decisions about Ohio at this point, just some general thoughts on the idea, but I figured she might want to go if she didn’t have any other plans. So I ask her if she’d go if I finalize plans.

Well, turns out my 3 sisters were out to dinner a few weeks ago and Abby [25F] tells the other 2 that our mom [56F] is planning to use Thanksgiving for her wedding reception with her new fiancée [~65M] because she anticipates us all being there.

This rubbed me the wrong way for a few reasons.

-She plans to commandeer a big holiday to make it about her and her marriage.

-She only told Abby and the rest of us only know because she’s spilling the beans (because Abby wasn’t told to spread this news).

-She expects us to be there without clearing it with us first. I have two kids, Abby and Liddy have serious boyfriends, and Annie [30F] is almost always traveling, so you have to let us know this type of stuff well in advance.

Those things alone are reasons for me to not want to go, but she’s also onto her 4th marriage. She has made it increasingly clear over the last year that she isn’t super seriously in love with the guy, just that he’s got acceptable qualities and she’s lonely and needs financial stability. So we never expected a reception or anything notable in the first place.

As soon as Liddy told me about this, I decided to finalize plans to go to Ohio for Thanksgiving. I was probably going to do it anyway, but the way my mom is handling this whole marriage/holiday thing, I’d rather just not be around.

For whatever reason yesterday I decided to log in and check it out. Everything looks fine.

The only thing I have asked my in-laws to take care of is the dessert. We’re doing cupcakes (it’s a small wedding and the cost is under $200). My in-laws make considerably more than my parents and I know money isn’t an issue for them. 

The problem is that my MIL is notoriously selfish and has to make everything about her. When we decided on a pork dish for dinner, she threw a fit because she doesn’t like pork. So we added a beef option, literally only to please her. Keeping in mind that she isn’t even the one paying for it. 

Now, she’s complaining about how we aren’t catering to her fairweather gluten and dairy “intolerances”. It’s only an issue when she wants it to be, like my wedding, and when it’s not convenient for her, she has no problems eating it. She just ordered pizza hut the other night and had breadsticks and cheese pizza with zero complaints or issues. So she’s throwing a fit about the cupcakes because they aren’t gluten and dairy free. However, when we brought home leftovers from the tastings she ate them without issue and said they were delicious.

Myself and a coworker that I sit with in my office take it in turns to make each other tea, as is required by British social conventions/proper office etiquette. The dispute stems from the fact that he has what I would describe as a serious problem in the sense that he seemingly needs a cup of tea every ten minutes to live. I myself go through about 4 a day.

This has led the the expectation from him that I should stop what I'm doing, get up from my desk and go make him a cuppa every other time he wants one.

In my mind if I've been the last one to make us both a cup then when it gets round to me wanting another It's still his turn to make the round, all the extra cups he's made for himself in between are superfluous.

We're both quite stubborn on this matter which has led to him putting his mug on my desk and constantly pestering me to make him tea whenever he feels like it's my turn and me normally refusing until one of us breaks.

He was 2 weeks early and the doctors wanted him to stay in the NICU (ultimately for about 10 days). We decided that we didn't want anyone to visit at the hospital because among other things it was very overwhelming. My sister then proceeds to guilt me into letting her make me host them at our house while my wife stays at the hospital. During said visit my sister (who didn't have a serious boyfriend) says to me that she is really jealous of me and my wife. I felt this was kind of inappropriate but decided to let it pass.

Now she lives with my parents rent free with her son.

Fast forward to fall of last year, and my parents decided that they were going to sell their RV trailer because they needed a bigger one so my sister and her son could come with them. My wife and I had been looking for an RV trailer for a while and offer to buy it, matching the highest offer they had been given thus far.  We decided to keep the trailer at my parents house over winter. Come March, my wife and I discovered she was pregnant with. We decided that since it would be difficult to have a toddler and 2 infants in the trailer, we should sell the trailer and use the money as a down payment on a minivan. I told my parents and my sister this plan she offers to sell it for us so we don't have to bother bringing it to our home several hours away.

My sister sold the trailer for double and transfers me the money but it's only what we paid for the trailer initially, I ask her why she isn't giving me the whole amount, she says we got the family discount. I bring this up to my parents who tell me that my sister needs the money and I should just drop. I'm angry but decide it's not worth it since my parents are clearly on her side.

It seems fairly insignificant but Disney plus comes out and I have 2 newborns at home and my sister calls me up and tells me that I need to share our Disney plus password and tells me that I owe her  my password since I used to use their netflix while I was in college. When I said no they got upset and called me ungrateful and say I was taking advantage of my parents.

Almost 2 months later my mother won't speak to me, because of ""how I treated her and my sister"", my sister has called and berated me for upsetting her and my mother and called me ungrateful and things that would make a sailor blush.

I finally decided that I was going to cut her out of my life when my dad calls and says that even though I don't own ""all the blame"" I need to get over it and make up with my sister, because he and my mother were upset they had yet to visit my twins despite them being almost 3 months old. When I explained to him that the 2 of them were more than welcome to visit anytime they wanted, he told me that they were a family and if she wasn't welcome, they weren't coming without her.

1,"AITA for stealing a textbook? | This happened a few semesters ago, but I've been wondering about it ever since.

During finals week, I went to use the restroom, and I noticed someone had hidden a textbook behind the garbage bin. Presumable to cheat during their exams. So, since nobody was there, I just put the book in my bag, and brought it home.


&nbsp;

My reasoning is, the only reason why somebody would leave a textbook near a trash can is:

1) Because they wanted to throw it away, which in that case, I have no qualm in taking the book.


2) Because they were using it to cheat on their finals.... which honestly, that's on you. Don't leave stuff lying on the floor if you don't want people to take it. Besides, you really shouldn't be cheating in college, it isn't fair to others who actually bother to put in the effort to study.


&nbsp;


This wasn't like a basic 101 class textbook, this was a big beefy, 300 level class... so the person cheating, was cheating for a test in their Major. And if you have to cheat to pass in your major, then you're in the wrong major (and probably shouldn't even be in college).

The other day for Christmas, I got a couple LEGO sets. I know, I'm an adult and I still live at home, but LEGOs can still be pretty cool. Now, my family tends to have pretty big Christmases, and usually for a few weeks after Christmas, we put all our new stuff back under the tree for easy access. Right there, in the living room, I had my two, new, unopened LEGO sets.

I was on the couch playing video games, when my brother and his friends came in. We're similar in age, so most of our friends are mutual, but he definitely hangs out with them more. They're trying to find something to do to kick the night off. While they're all over, just chillin, ""Bert"" walks over, and and opens one of my LEGO sets. This is where I might be in the wrong. Bert continues to build the set at the foot of the couch. The way I was sitting, I couldn't see him. I was also focused in video games, and not whatever was going on with my brother and his friends.

Eventually, ""Ernie"" gets up, and starts building the seat with Burt. This is when I notice what they're doing. I stood up, pulled my headphones off, and as calmly as possible said ""What the heck guys? Is that my LEGO set?"" They sheepishly nodded. I then started to scold them, saying like ""dude, thats \*my\* set, what made you think you could build it? why would you open my stuff?"" I then told them all to get out, and find something else to do, though I never raised my voice. The other friends were already getting bored, so now they're all off getting soda.

0,"AITA for taking up a job I don't really need, and depriving someone else of that opportunity? | I'll be upfront. I have a sugar daddy arrangement with a great guy, let's call him Mark. Call me what you want, but I've a house in my name, and have enough for me to stop working and live frugally for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

I work in sales to pass the time in a highly sought after company. Because I don't need the extra money, I'm extremely alright with coming into work and leaving on time. I use all of my paid vacation too. Mark is not frequently in town, but when he is, I set aside time for him. This has rightly landed me near or at the bottom of the company rankings amongst my peers. I do put in my 100% when I am in office, I just don't stay late or come in over the weekends and I take all my vacation days.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, this sticks out like a sore thumb in the company I'm in. The culture is one where everyone works mad overtime just to hit the incentive and performance bonuses. My colleagues have been making many snide remarks about how lazy I am, how my life will amount to nothing and how much more I could be earning if I just worked harder. Because your career is everything, I guess. Just a note, many of them are living decently, but not enough to stop the mad dash. 

&#x200B;

One day, we were out at lunch at a higher priced restaurant (bill came out to be $70 per pax) on a whim. I shocked that this particular group of colleagues asked me, but was happy to join the 5 of them, since it was a while since I went out with them. At one point in the convo, someone commented that we should do this more often because it was nice, and I agreed. Cue an offhand comment of ""Oh AnnualCamel, are you sure you can afford that? We can go to a less expensive restaurant if you want"", and I replied honestly this price was ok, as long as it wasn't /that/ often. Then the bombshell ""Maybe you could if you worked harder, like the rest of us"" was dropped.

&#x200B;

I was so mad, I told them the truth - that I could retire, but was just working because I wanted to stay occupied and because honestly I liked doing the job. They probed more and made a (correct) inference that my money was from a sugar daddy. This for some reason set them all off. They said that I was a massive asshole for stealing the job from someone else who would have appreciated the opportunity to work in the company we were in. And that if I didn't want it I should GTFO and free up the space. They then started rumours in the office about what a slut I was (not even the right insult) and they were sure I was sleeping with the bosses to keep my job (I wasn't).

0,"AITA for not wanting to buy my mom a house? | Basically, some stuff in my childhood was pretty traumatizing and involved my uncle.

I told my mom by accident in March 2018.  In summer 2019, my mom wanted to begin a civil court case and I signed for her to speak for me in court. I was grateful but a little uncomfortable with her need for vengeance. She expressed she wanted to ruin my uncle financially. This used to be my fantasy, but when I moved away for college in 2018 I finally felt peace and let it drop.  During winter 2019 she told me my uncle had agreed to start negotiating a settlement.

She started the conversation with “You have to trust me.”  ... and talked about how money can split people apart.  She told me how much money she hoped to get and how she would insure the money‘s safety and I wouldn’t have full access since I’m young and stuff.

She THEN started talking about how she wanted to use the money to buy a house in another state so she and my sister can move away for a fresh start. She made it sound like it would be an “investment”  for me to be a “homeowner” but something doesn’t sit right with me. I don’t like the idea of her taking the settlement money (an uncertain quantity) to start a new life. She kept saying “honey, I’ve never had my own house to live in, I’ve worked so hard my whole life with nothing to show for it, this house could make a difference”.  Tbh, it feels like blood money and if I receive it, I want to pay for my schooling and save the rest for when I need it. I don’t want a car/ new apartment. The money is tainted, yet I feel sickeningly entitled to it.  I hadn’t aimed to gain money from the start, but now I feel like it’s mine. I suffered for it. 

I am not against giving my parents money. I’ve been working full time since May 2019 to pay for college and support myself. The settlement would cover my tuition and pay off my parents’s loans + some nice vacations or something. 

My mom pushed to take this to civil court, it feels like this was maybe her plan all along. I feel like she’s somehow profiting from my pain and taking this as a “win” in her life.

I’m still not sure about whether my mom is capable of taking the money when it’s issued. I’m just stressed (the negotiations start next month) because she has a lot of sway over me and I’m not sure if I could deny her if it came down to it, especially since it could totally wreck our complex relationship. 

I haven’t really spoken to her about how I feel yet- I know she is not going to take it well. In addition, the actual amount of settlement might not match up with what she’s demanding and she might be getting her hopes up. I love my mom and I’m afraid my discomfort means I’m being selfish/greedy.

TL;DR

My mom wants to buy a house “for me” (that she will live in) with settlement money. the case is something she said she is doing for me, against my uncle.

0,"AITA for locking the door to the room while my roommate was in the shower? | My roommate and I share one dorm room. She has a bad habit where, sometimes, she’ll leave to take a shower and not take her key or cell phone with her. Usually it’s not a problem because I’m in the room. However, I do have a really ingrained habit of taking my key out and locking the door, so if I’m not in the room and she’s not in the room, I will do it without thinking about it. 

A couple of weeks ago she went to go take a shower in the morning, while I was asleep. I got up, got ready to leave, and locked the door on the way out. Fortunately I was just going to grab something for breakfast so she was only stuck outside the room in her towel for a few minutes.

Yesterday, same situation. Woke up, she was gone. I was running really late so I rushed my routine and locked the door on the way out. When I got back after class, she was wearing the clothes of another girl in the dorm and PISSED. She asked why I didn’t look for her to see if she was in the showers when I saw she was gone and the door wasn’t bolted. I said I didn’t really think about it and asked why she didn’t call me. She doesn’t know my number by heart and couldn’t find anyone with it. One of her friends was there and remarked as though he was trying to be a peacekeeper that I REALLY should have checked to see if her towel was gone after the first time she got locked out and, if it was gone, gone to the showers and called around looking for her. I thought this was a little ridiculous and said so in a joking tone, but nobody was laughing. Now I have a bunch of people pissed at me because she’s more popular than me in the dorm.

I wasn’t trying to teach her a lesson or anything, I honestly didn’t even think about it. However, thinking on it now, I don’t really get why it’s on me to always keep track of whether she’s showering to see if I should lock the door, when it would be so easy for her to take her key.

0,"AITA for expecting at least a contribution from a buddy who broke my property? | Please adjudicate on this 20 year old argument! It's not a friendship breaker but I recently introduced him to Reddit and this sub and he said ""hey this could solve our argument!"" so here I am. 

So my buddy and I used to share an apartment for about 4-5 years in the mid to late 90's. A lot of the 'hardware' in the apartment was mine, although we both used it. This all happened in the last few months of our cohabiting. 

One of the items we both used was a steam iron. Now I never buy cheap, crappy steam irons because getting a damned good one with a ceramic sole plate and great steam flow makes ironing much easier than one of those crappy steel sole plate ones and, while my iron was a little beaten up and had a few cracks in it due to us both using it and occasionaly dropping it a couple of times from - again - both of us - it worked fine. I think it was about £100 when I'd initially bought it in the mid 90's  when we moved in together and that was a damned expensive iron back then. 

My buddy was doing his ironing one day and somehow he managed to drop the iron good and proper - it hit the floor at just the right angle to break the plastic handle and completely killed it. 

""Looks like we need a new iron"" I said. Much hilarity was had that my mate now had to go to work with a half wrinkled shirt, but he went out and bought a replacement iron that day which was a lot crappier than the one we originally had. I asked him why hadn't he replaced it with a decent one and he said that this was HIS new iron as mine was obviously old and busted (it was a bit beaten up but worked perfectly up until that point) and he wasn't going to buy me a new iron to replace an old one. I pointed out that it was only old and beaten up because we'd both used it but he wasn't having it: we moved out a few months later (just natural progression - he'd planned to move in with his gf for some time and we were waiting for the lease to get to the end so had been planning this for a while) and the fucker kept the shitty but new iron.

We are still close mates and still meet for beers today and, when he's wearing something that's obviously been ironed, we have a few jabs about him ironing his shit with an iron that should have been given to me after he killed mine, and still call each other assholes over it.

So AITA for expecting he replace my iron he broke - definitely not with a hugely expensive one as that would be profiteering from the situation, or at least contribute towards a new one - or am I NTA because he ultimately broke it and then kept the new one without any offer to me of even giving me money towards a replacement?

I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. 

So this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. 

Am I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?

I have my own small business, and a part time job. My boyfriend, who I've been seeing for a year, has not worked in that time. When we first started seeing each other, he would ask me for help with a bill or two. I assumed this was one-time help because he was struggling. Within a couple months, I was paying his rent, electric, internet, cell phone, and car insurance, PLUS he expects me to pay when we go out and to help him buy things like video games. I give him my biweekly check from my part-time job entirely. He thinks that I make a lot of money (I don't), because I earn more than he ever has at any of his previous jobs. I've told him multiple times that I don't earn enough to support two people and he needs to find a source of income, but nothing has changed. My own bills are going into default and collections and I can't afford health insurance because I've been paying for his things. I have no savings. I have no credit. This is ruining me financially. But whenever I bring up the prospect of him being responsible for himself financially, it becomes a huge thing - screaming, crying, telling me I NEED to help him, etc. He recently found a job working part time at a local fast food restaurant, but for some reason the training he was supposed to start this weekend never materialized. I'm not sure if he blew it off, or if it really will happen soon.

&#x200B;

The reason he's not working is he has a physical disability (he needs reconstructive surgery on one of his knees due to a car accident a few years ago) and several mental health diagnoses, including Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD. I've suggested he apply for social security, but he says it will take too long to start getting money through them (however, if he had applied a year ago he'd probably be getting a check now). I've suggested he apply for fuel assistance and cash assistance and any number of other benefits, but he never follows through and tells me he can't do these things without my help. The only source of income he has is a little over $100 in food stamps. He asks me to supplement his food budget, and also to do things like pick him up fast food and order him pizza.

0,"AITA for walking out of a dinner party with my boyfriend's family, because of something his Uncle said to me? | I went to a dinner party with my boyfriend's extended family last weekend. I've met a lot of the family already last year at Thanksgiving. 

At the dinner, I was talking to my boyfriend's Aunt and Uncle about what I do (systems engineering for nuclear power plants) and then his Uncle said something pretty gross about how the guys there must like having a pretty young lady to look at. 

Now I admit that hit a sore spot for me. I have had some crappy experiences with coworkers not respecting me because I'm a young woman.

I firmly said to my boyfriend's Uncle ""I don't care for how you just spoke to me; I better not hear anything like that again"". I was trying to be firm but respectful; speaking to him in the same way I'd speak to someone at work who said something I didn't appreciate. And he got kind of stubborn, saying he was just paying me a compliment. By this point, everyone was staring.

I was feeling pretty mad and I realized it would be a better call to walk away rather than escalate. So I said ""excuse me, I'm going to take a walk before I say something I'll regret."" And I went and grabbed my shoes and purse and went for a walk.

I'd already been having a really bad week before this, my best friend moved out of town and I missed her a lot, my apartment had been partially flooded by a plumbing issue, I was exhausted from the long drive the night before. And this thing, that should have been a little annoyance, was like the straw that broke the camel's back for me. 

I started crying when I walked. I texted my best friend to tell her I missed her. She called me right away and could tell I was upset, and we talked for a while as I wandered. Talking to her made me feel a lot better, and after catching up for about 20 minutes, I noticed my phone was dying, and I ought to have been getting back, so I said bye.

My phone died right after we hung up, and I started making my way back to my boyfriend's house. But I must have taken a wrong turn as I tried to backtrack my steps; I was lost in suburban sprawl.

I saw the church steeple in the distance, and I realized that if I went to the church, the train station was close by. And I knew my way to my boyfriend's family's house from the station. So I took that roundabout way back. By the time I got back, I'd been out for about two hours.

I got back and my boyfriend was upset with me for being gone for so long, not answering calls, and generally for walking out rather than doing something less dramatic. I told him about my phone dying, about getting lost, and he was still upset with me. I'd made things very uncomfortable at the party when I was gone. 

I apologized and said I'd tried to walk off to deescalate things, and it wasn't my intention to end up doing the exact opposite. But he was still upset with me for being a drama queen, which I don't think is fair.

It might also be important to mention that our dad's are brothers and do not get on very well and our grandparents are closer to my dad.

We both applied. She got rejected. I got in. The next week, we were at our grandparents and she seemed visibly upset with me.

0,"WIBTA For cutting off contact with my mom over money? | So this is a throwaway because my family knows my main account and I’m not ready for this discussion with them right yet. If this is not allowed, please let me know/delete my post!

So when I was in high school, my family hit a pretty rough patch. I was working at a local store and because of this rough patch, my parents needed financial assistance. 

Right from when they first borrowed money, the deal was that it was to eventually be repaid, it was in fact “borrowing” and not me having to pay to live there. Most of the money went to hydro bills, rent, heat, food, etc. But, occasionally my parents would both spend money on things that weren’t necessities. 

After I left home and went to school, they stopped borrowing money. My mom hasn’t worked for a few years now, and lives on a pension. She’s fully capable of working but refuses to. My parents are going through a divorce, so nearly a year ago I told them that I expected the debt to be split evenly between them. I expected each of them to pay $3500, as all the money borrowed was used pretty evenly. We all agreed that was fair. I agreed that I wouldn’t be charging interest on the money borrowed, despite paying extremely high interest rates on the money I had to borrow to finish my education. We also made agreements on payment plans they could both afford, so that we knew there was both the ability to pay, and the expectation of regular payments being made. 

Since making that agreement, my dad has paid regularly. My mom hasn’t made a single payment, and any time I’ve mentioned to my parents that I had to miss out on a great opportunity because of my inability to afford it, my mom either ignored it or said something along the lines of “life sucks, if you really cared about it you’d be able to afford it”. 

This is especially frustrating as I’ve always had a better relationship with my mom than with my dad, and it’s starting to make me question my entire perception on who my parents were. 

This money has put a serious strain on my mental health and my relationship with my parents. I’m at a point now where I feel hopeless in salvaging the relationship with my mom and want to know if I would be the asshole if I took the plunge and severed relationships with her.

The thing is that i love all kind of riddles, puzzles, quests, etc and i was trying to make my girlfriend join the dark side.

1,"AITA for not punishing my daughter for standing up to her cousin? | Hi all. 

My sister Eleanor and her husband Paul were staying over at our place for my much younger brother's wedding over the weekend.

Eleanor and me have daughters who are both 15. My daughter is called Sarah and hers is Becky. They are both very pretty but are polar opposites in terms of personality. Becky is very confident, outgoing, has loads of friends and is a huge party girl. She's also very capable academically and according to Eleanor is top or near the top of most of her classes. Sarah is the opposite. She is a kind and gentle person but is sensitive and at times awkward, with major issues with her confidence. She has a few very close friends rather than being part of a large group. Her academic performance is decent but not exceptional like Becky, but we are nevertheless proud of her because we know she works hard at school. 

Becky bullies Sarah and has done for a long time. She is spoiled by her parents who think that it's ''just harmless kid stuff''. Just this weekend she told Sarah that she was too ugly to go the wedding and that she would have to stay out of the photos. She also tried to push her out of big family photo at the reception. My wife Diane had to find Sarah after she ran outside crying. This bullying has gone on for years and nobody has made an attempt to stop it. 

Sunday morning in the garden we heard someone scream inside the house. We ran into the kitchen to find Becky feeling around the kitchens trying to find her glasses. She has very bad eyesight, bad enough that according Eleanor she needs to feel around for her glasses on her bedside table since everything is a blur for her. She has worn glasses in a high prescription since she was a baby. 
Becky was crying her eyes out until Diane found her glasses in one of the food cupboards. Once she had got them back on she started saying that Sarah took her glasses. 

I called Sarah downstairs and she admitted that she did take the glasses. We were all disappointed but Eleanor and Paul proceeded to tear into her about how cruel and nasty she was and how frightened and upset Becky was because of her. 

Sarah tried to explain that Becky had been taunting her about the photos and had been saying that she would be cropped out, but Becky's parents had no sympathy and said that maybe a ''bully'' like Sarah deserves that. I went ballistic and said that Becky had been bullying Sarah for years and they have laughed it off. Paul tried to say that Becky's ''girly teasing'' wasn't bullying and that what Sarah did was. 

I can see why Eleanor wants Sarah punished, but at the same time her daughter was the instigator and I don't agree with her wanting to punish our daughter after hers inflicted years of psychological abuse on her. We don't want to punishing Sarah. Obviously it was wrong to take the glasses, but it was a response to years of torment.

girlfriend Anna asked me to make her a tailored dress as she is VERY curvy and has a disproportionate torso-to-leg ratio which makes every dress look like a t shirt on her.

I complied and did the best I could, and she was thrilled with the result. I charged her only for materials used, because she’s a fancy girl and liked a Liberty of London print that we had to ship over from the UK. If it was cheaper I would have swallowed it but shits expensive yo.

She told a mutual friend and colleague about my dress making abilities (I like to stress I’m not the best at this and don’t derive any pleasure from making stuff for others. The pressure is too real and I hate it) and this friend begged and begged me to make her a dress that she wanted to use for her engagement photo shoot because she wanted something ‘bespoke’ 

This put me in an awkward position and I didn’t want to let her down, so I accepted despite not really wanting to. This mutual friend is larger than my friend Anna, and wanted a slightly cheaper fabric, also from Liberty. Again, I charged my friend only for the materials used, not for my time.

She was incredibly surprised when I told her how much I was charging, and told me I had charged Anna less. I told her the truth, which is I was ONLY charging for the material and even though it was only slightly less expensive, I had used much more of it in the making of the dress. I pointed out Anna’s dress didn’t have sleeves, this one did, etc. 

My friend has told everybody at work what happened, because she feels I unfairly charged her because of her weight. It sounds unfair but it’s her size, she’s bigger and it cost more to clothe her.

I get a 30 minute break and then get another 30 minutes to go get my sister. At work we are not siblings, we are co workers. We dont treat each other as siblings and she doesn't get any special treatment.

I have a scooter that needs fixed. Just an oil change and a new starter relay. I did the math and I'm losing $1680 a year at minimum by getting my sister so I suggested to my mom that she fixes the scooter and drives to work. It's all back roads and is only a 10 minute ride. My mother said it's not going to happen. ""Riding a scooter is dangerous and how will someone with anxiety handle that."" I told her she needs to stop sheltering her and get her ready for the real world.

It ended up in a huge argument because she doesn't feel she can do it but I feel like it's not my responsibility to get her to work every day. It upsets my coworkers. I wouldn't leave every day to get a coworker like that, why do I need to do it for her.

I gave my mom an ultimatum last night. Told her my sister can either fix the scooter and I'll take her to work until she can get it running or monday when she gets paid shell have to uber, take the bus, or the town club car to get to work. I will not take her anymore. My mother tells me I need to stop being an asshole and get the d*ck out of my ass. Shes my sister and my responsibility. My sister hears all this and is completely against it too and I cant help but feel it's because my mother puts her down so fast.

I cant help but feel it's not my responsibility. My mom wont be here forever and I'm not going to take care of my sister forever.  She has money saved and is capable of fixing it. She can handle having a stable job, managing money, in my mind this is the next step to her self reliance. Am I really the asshole in the situation? The scooter sounds the most realistic to me.

I’ve known A for about 6 years but we didn’t become actual friends until about 4 years ago. A and I had a good friendship and not much changed when I started dating my SO. We sometimes all hung out together but nothing unusual. 

Within the last year or so I’ve noticed a change in how A behaves when we’re with my SO. A tries really hard to come off as very intelligent and “cool” in front of my SO and often at my expense; If my SO and I disagree with each other on something, A will debate me every time to just be on my SO’s side even when they’re wrong. A will argue with me on anything (even topics in my own career field) just to make themselves seem smarter than me in front of my SO. A will contradict themselves or back track something they said just to be in agreement with my SO. A also very often goes out of the way to talk to my SO about things in front of me that A knows I can’t contribute to like their mutual friends or movies they’ve seen that I haven’t. (Background, A and my SO knew of each other as children but have years between them age wise so they’ve never been actual friends until me.) 

Recently a reliable source told me that A was telling them how A and my SO were ‘such good friends’ before I came around, and that I have no place to find it weird for them to hang out together alone. I’m not comfortable with that at this point. I am not by any means jealous or concerned, I trust my SO completely.

0,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to use my food to feed her friends? | A few days ago, my girlfriend hosted a brunch day for her and her friends at our house. My girlfriend bought some food and wine so they could make a whole event out of it. 

I don't have a lot of spare money and so what I spend on food is usually all I have. Usually  what I buy, I have to make last until the next payday. Each meal is calculated and planned for my work lunches. 

After work I was at the gym and I receive a text from my girlfriend asking if she could cook some of my chicken breasts that I set aside for my lunches because her friends were hungry and specifically wanted the chicken. I replied with, ""I'd prefer if you didn't. Can you use the pork instead?"" She didn't like this response and proceeded to say ""No its fine, I told them you said no...thanks."" Knowing my girlfriend and how she can be sometimes, I tried to call her and work through the issue. She was still mad and I was at the gym so I gave up. She kept calling me back and I did eventually realize that I had some extra chicken (a decent amount) in the freezer which I told her I forgot about and I would be more than happy to let her use it. This particular chicken was what she had wanted to use in the first place but I confused it with the chicken I set out for my lunches. 

This still didn't make her happy and by the time I got home, our other roommate defrosted some of her own chicken so my girlfriend could use it. My girlfriends argument was that I should have not said no to begin with and should have just let her take it; she stated she would have given me money to buy more or gone out and bought more herself. This last statement was hard to believe as the next two proceeding days she works nights and wouldn't have time. She stated that if my friends came over she would give them whatever they wanted and tried to be a good host and person. 

Regardless I didn't feel as if I acted out of line asking if she could use the pork instead and once I realized my mistake I thought I corrected myself and gave her what she wanted. It all culminated with her saying I am inconsiderate, mean, and so forth.

1,"AITA for posting and printing a family picture my SIL ""nixed""? | So upfront, I'm not crazy about my brother's wife. She's kind of a princess, more than a little icy/aloof, and we've never clicked. So I might be less inclined to give her any leeway than I would other family members.

I'm the de facto family photographer and we recently all got together for my niece's first birthday (brother and SIL's daughter). At one point, I gathered everyone together--my parents, my aunts and uncles, my brother and SIL, and my niece--for a collection of photos to commemorate the occasion. 

Later, I was showing my brother the group of photos on my camera and he really liked them. I asked if he had a favorite and he said they all looked great. At this point, SIL was looking over our shoulder and said that she liked pictures 1 and 3, but really hated 4 and 5 because it looked like she had a double chin (she was leaning over to kiss niece on the head and it definitely gives that illusion). 

Well, the problem is that picture number 5 is the only one where my mom looks amazing. My mom is really camera shy and tends to be tense until the very end. It's the only photo where she is smiling and looking like her usual happy, beautiful self. Everyone else looks good and it's only my SIL who is in an unflattering position. So I said I'd think about it, but then later posted that photo on Facebook and got that one printed for my parents' house, as well as to send to my brother. I do a lot of post-processing work and print on my own dime, so it's a lot of work for me.

Well, now my brother says ITA because there were lots of photos that I could have used but I went with one of the ones his wife asked me not to use. Which A) I didn't actually ask her opinion and B) she just looks like she has a little double chin, it's not the end of the world. She's kissing her daughter, it's sweet. But my brother says that it was niece's birthday photo and an important occasion for him and his wife, so SIL's opinion should have been taken into consideration more than usual and that she mattered more than my mom in the pic.

0,"AITA for expecting my SO to clean the house since he is home a lot more? | I work full time and go to school so he can work part time while he's in school. I didn't want him worrying about balancing a crazy work schedule and school, as he's struggled with school before, plus I am in my final year and only taking 2 classes per semester while he is in 13 credit hours. 

When we moved in, the expectations were that he would clean the apartment when home since he will only be working 3 days a week, 4 or 5 hour shifts. I work 5 days a week and work 7-8 hour shifts depending on the week and hour budget. I sometimes have to close at work and open at 7am the next morning.

We got into a huge argument today. He stated that if we were going to equally divide finances, he refuses to do any house work because at that point he is, in his eyes, equally contributing. I said that was BS, as he's home far more than I am and spends most of his free time out with friends or playing games, and I expected the house to be livable and cleaned since he spends MOST of his day here. I have been the one cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry, putting it away, moving things around, etc. for the entire time we've been here (even though he's been unemployed), so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that he doesn't want to contribute cleanliness.

I conceded and said okay, I'll pay half of rent, electricity, and internet, but will need you to pick up more than half of the groceries bc I also have a car payment and health insurance I have to pay for on my own. His car and health insurance is paid by his parents. He said fine, but he still will not do housework. 

I am beyond mad. I feel like all of the responsibility of the house and finances have fallen on me even though we agreed that he'd take care of cleaning since he's the one with more time available to do so. I either suck it up and pay the vast majority of our joint bills, and maybe potentially have a clean home, or work full time go to school and clean a shared living space while my partner sits and plays games.

Tl;dr: I am working full time and going to school so my partner can work part time and focus on his education. We agreed, before moving in, that he would do the housework since he was home more. Now he's arguing that sharing bills is equal contribution and I will have to clean the house if I want it cleaned, even after 40 hour work weeks and my own classes.

My brother works and contributes to about 5% of the groceries in the house, my mom supporting us with the other 95% from her retirement fund from the Navy.

Before my gbs, I was fully vaccinated for travel, got every booster and paid for extras not covered by my insurance. My family has the argument that I'm selfish and the person with cancer might die - but anyone can die whenever and I'm missing out on the core family events

I've seen a bunch of doctors for a long time. My case was interesting. Some say to never do a live vaccine again (gbs is autoimmune). Most say don't do a flu shot (a very weak link). Some say I'm fine for anything and it's just superstición. My favorite student doctor said it best ""this is hard enough, right? Why risk making it worse. We aren't sure you'd live a second time. We don't know if it's related to the flu shot but we do know it does happen to people twice"" 

It's just a flu shot. Who cares? Our situations are equal in the end anyway. My family thinks since there's no real link between Guillian Barre and the flu shot I should just get it - that I'm being silly. But the doctor is right, I couldn't survive this journey mentally a second time so why take any risks. Maybe in 50 years we'll have enough data to say they're totally not related but it doesn't matter now.

1,"AITA for not washing dishes every single time? | I live with my girlfriend and I love her, she seems to expect me to wash the dishes all the time, which I consider unfair.

She is the only one who cooks and does the shopping - she's a very picky eater (to the level of using different utensils when she makes something else for me than she does for herself!) and she sais she prefers to pick her own groceries. But after she's done cooking, she just fills the pots and pans with water and leaves them to soak - until she needs them again. Yes, she's very messy.

I used to do the washing up, but then I became annoyed with being the only one to ever do that and stopped. Then she picked up the slack (washing everything before cooking rather than after), but she was clearly angry about it.

Quite recently she asked me to please not put plastic boxes I had food in (I don't know what to call them in English) in the sink, that they are in her way. Why doesn't she wash them and put them away, if they are bothering her so much? And why does she have to leave the pans dirty for days without doing something about them?

She told me once she expects me to do it in exchange for the cooking and shopping, but she was the one who chose to do that and frankly I feel tired being the only one to clean in the flat. (I'm the only one to vacuum, general tidying is done as needed, but usually it's her stuff so I can't do it anyway). 

I told her this, she said fine in an obviously disappointed voice, but now she starts to look angry again and there is almost no space for me to prepare breakfast because of the stupid dirty pans.

This has left me fed up


I (25F) have been with my boyfriend for 3  years.

Our relationship has been good, but lately the bad has outweighed the good, I'm trying though.

My boyfriend is God awful with money and is in debt.

He is always borrowing money, I shouldn't lend him money but then we argue and I just hate arguing with him.

He has borrowed £340 from me, three months ago.

I've finally grown bored of waiting for him to repay me, I know he has no plans of repaying me and luckily I'm not relying on the money,I've been telling him just buy dinner one night to make it up to me.

Today he got home and asked if I wanted to go out, to try and make it up to me for borrowing all that money

We went out, my favourite place and we had a great time.

He kept ordering me drinks too, and it genuinely felt like the start of our relationship again because we were happy 

Well it came to paying, the bill was £80.

He expected me to pay £60 of it

He hasn't been paid this month yet and owes his friends money.

I ended up paying.

Hes now upset with me for expecting him to pay and not initially offering to pay half

I’ll come right out and say I never really liked her. She’s in grad school living off her daddys money while my brother has a high paying finance job. It looks like she was just trying to find a new pay check for when her dad stops covering everything and shes using my brother for that.

My brother arranged a massive proposal where both families and all their friends would come celebrate after he proposed. She really pissed me off at the celebration. If shes really just shy, why is she suddenly all over my brother, kissing him and sitting in his lap and talking to everyone. She was on her phone the whole time taking pictures of her hand and the fucking massive ring he bought her. It’s like her whole personality changed once she got what she wanted. On top of that one of my aunts made a joke about them having kids soon and my brothers girlfriend said nope I’m not having kids get ready for some adopted babies. It rubbed me the wrong way that she couldn’t just roll with the joke and needed to assert herself suddenly when she was never even talking to us before.

Was I the asshole or was I set up to be the asshole? | So much background here and 3000 characters is never going to cut it so if you read please trust me that I'm trying to do my best to narrate this reliably. I am 28, first real job as VP of sales in a smallish manufacturing company. There are two other VPs but I have the most issues with the VP of manufacturing (Ben) who I feel always steps on my toes (this is very important) and is super jealous that he's 65 and just got the job and I'm a woman and am at his level. 

Last week boss was out of town so security company were sending me notifications. One night company called and alarm was going off. I drove in and was met by our security company. Only one at work was bosses son who had his beats on and didn't hear anything. No obvious damage and nothing seemed missing so I went home. But next morning about 20k in samples were missing. Police came, could find no evidence of break and interviewed everyone and the detective told me he was 99% certain that the son walked out with the samples and asked if I wanted to have him arrested. Being the boss's son I tried to call my boss and he asked what the samples were, he said they were an old unit and he'd deal with it when he got back. I said ok. 

Here's where I made the huge mistake, I asked Ben for his advice on Friday. He told me strait up ""you need to accuse (son) in the staff meeting on Wednesday. If the detective said he did it, boss needs to know."" I have literally been sleepless ever since knowing what I should do. 

So meeting came and boss wanted to talk about the ""break in."" I spoke up and said that I was really sorry but all the evidence points to your son stealing the samples. At that moment Ben spoke up and said essentially ""oh hey about that, I forgot to tell you guys that I accidentally set off the alarm that night and I have the samples for my trip this week."" I wanted to die. Ben absolutely set me up to look bad in this. I am shocked at how petty a 65 year old man can be. Like blown away in my shoes.

Since then, I have driven all the time with one exception. When I found out I was selected for promotion, he insisted we go out and I could pick the place. I was just planning a chill night in as it was Tuesday, but he talked me down. When we got to the parking lot, he said, because I chose the place, I should drive, which sounded fair. Next week, we go to a place of his choosing, and I end up driving because he ""left his keys."" I brought up the trend a week later saying it was causing me not to want to go out with him. He said that because he drives a truck, a 50/50 split isn't beneficial for him but agreed to a driving one out of every three times. I agreed but stated that because I've already given him numerous rides (we went out to lunch numerous times at work where always was the one driving), that we should do 50/50 for October. He agrees.

Yesterday, I stopped avoiding him and we were leaving around the same time and he recommends a carpool. I say yes, again expecting him to drive but I again end up driving. Last night, we were both planning to go to this new bar with a buddy and he suggests a carpool again. I put my foot down and tell him, only if he's driving. He insists on me driving because he doesn't know the place but I say neither do I. He says my car will blend in more and nobody will mess with as opposed to his truck. After no budging on my side, he suggests an Uber, which I decline. I say I'm just driving and he says he'll tag along. I tell him firmly, that if I'm driving, he will not be in my car. He says he'll but me a beer, but I'm firm on the principle of the matter. Plus it's literally one dollar beer night. I stop talking to him and he assumes that means it's settle an tried to tag along an hour later as I'm leaving.

I stick to my guns, and end up leaving without but we have an argument about how with the beer I'd come up even on gas and if I'm going anyway, I should take him.

1,"AITA for having my pregnant wife take out the trash? | Incoming rant...When my wife and I first moved into our house, I wanted to opt for daily trash pickup. She’s from a different background and saw this as a waste, since the dump is 5-10 mins away, and we don’t have tons of trash. We argued about this a lot, since I didn’t want to end up being the person taking time out of my day to take trash to the dump. Finally, I agreed we wouldn’t do trash pickup, but she would do all of the dump runs since it was her decision. It’s worked and there’s been no tension up until right now.

My wife is 6 months pregnant with our first child and, obviously, showing. She has continued to do all of the dump runs. Honestly, since she took the task on, I haven’t thought about it much at all, only that the trash is taken away occasionally. If she’d asked me, I definitely would have helped her with the dump runs.

This last Saturday she came up to me and said, very angry, “Why did you put a bunch of wine boxes on top of the garage trash can?” She was mad because she uses the garage trash can for the cat litter and she came out with a bag of cat litter and she had to move everything around to get into the trash. I said I didn’t even think and I was sorry if it was an issue. She asked me if I thought magical trash fairies came in and took all of my shit for me.

I cottoned on that this was a bigger issue and asked what she was really upset about. She blew up and told me about how she went to the dump and a bunch of guys saw her moving heavy bags and boxes, and ran to come help her. They all were very critical of me, according to her, saying that a real man would be taking care of his pregnant wife instead of sitting on the couch. She found this embarrassing, according to her? I tried to defuse it and say that I’d take over trash duty, she was still mad and said I was a piece of shit for not even noticing and being lazy for years.

I just don’t get why she thinks I’m such an asshole for this, when she didn’t even TELL me it was a problem. And there’s a bunch of local dudes shit talking me, and SHE’S offended? She probably helped with the shit talking, given the way she was acting.

I recently moved across the country and away from my hairstylist of 5 years. I’m very sad about it and have been hesitant to find a stylist in my new city. I don’t do anything crazy to my hair— I am a natural golden blonde who colors her hair platinum blonde. 

I have a friend here, we’ll call her Sarah, who went to school for hair, but did not get licensed or pursue a career doing hair. I was talking to her about feeling overwhelmed looking for a new stylist when I don’t know many people here. She told me that she went to school for hair and has colored her friends’ hair in the past, and that she would be happy to do mine. I’m just now getting on my feet financially after the big move, so money has been extremely tight for me. This is a major factor in why I haven’t made any appointments at salons yet. Sarah is well aware of my financial situation. Although I believe it’s best to have licensed professionals do my hair within a salon, my finances have not made that feasible, so I took Sarah up on her offer. She told me what products to pick up at Sally’s and I brought them over to her place.

Sarah colored my roots and while it didn’t turn out the way I wanted it to, it was good enough. I knew it would fade within a few washes to my desired shade. She then asked me how much I wanted to pay her for it. I’m not good at those type of things, so I told her to pick a range that she feels comfortable with. We continued to hang out and had a nice time. 

About a week later, Sarah texted me saying that she felt somewhere between $50-75 would be appropriate, seeing as that’s what a root touch up in a salon would be. I was a little surprised by that seeing as 1) she isn’t licensed and 2) she didn’t do the best job (I expressed it in a respectful manner at the time and she understood/wasn’t offended). Regardless, I didn’t want to argue with her since she did me a favor, so I paid her $65.

She has since made remarks about how I need to have my roots touched up again, which I do. The problem is that I feel like I might as well go to a salon if I’m going to pay salon prices, especially so I can get my desired result. I kept my coloring products at her place because I didn’t think she would want me to pay that much. I feel uncomfortable because she has expressed that she wants to do it soon, but I don’t feel like she deserves to be paid that much.

The cake is particularly a big deal, and usually people are very specific about what they want. We recently hired a new girl who so far has been great, and her birthday happened to be this week, so I set about asking her last week what kind of cake she wanted. She didn't ask for something really specific, but she specified that she'd like any kind of ice cream cake, any kind of cake with fruit and cream, or with interesting tea flavors. She also said absolutely no vegan cakes and no chocolate, which as you can guess, puts this cake off the list for most people. 

We have a few people with dietary restrictions, and they've mentioned feeling a bit sad at being left out before, so I thought it was pretty unfair of her to specify that she wants to exclude some people. Of course, no chocolate is also difficult to deal with with an office full of people since most people love chocolate. We've had wacky requests before, but it still seemed really off to me especially since she's so new. And since I'm technically in charge of the whole day party thing, I thought it would be nice if I could find something that she loved but that also everyone could enjoy. I ordered a beautiful matcha and strawberry vegan cake from a local bakery whose vegan baked goods I've had before, and thought it would be great. 

Come to the party. Everything was fine and good, she thought the cake looked beautiful, she was super happy...until she bit into it. Somehow, she could tell it was vegan. She asked me if it was, I confirmed, and she put the piece back down, gave me a look, and kind of walked off.

Fay asked if I wanted to shoot for a 2 day corporate event. I would receive $25 ph and another goodie bag, same rate. I said yes as the last event was fun. I asked my boyfriend, call him Joe, to help. We'd split the cash, be reimbursed for travel, and were each promised a goodie bag.

They have no contingency plan for if we can’t find a new place before the 22nd of next month and are relying on my boyfriend and I to secure the deposit and first month’s rent. They’ll pitch in what they can now and will reimburse us for the rest of their half once we get settled because their money is tied up in their apartment right now. We will also be purchasing a w/d and a kitchen table set for the house. Due to this, my boyfriend and I will be taking the master bedroom. 

My friend and his girlfriend are hoping for at least a 3br so that they can have the extra room for the baby. Before this, we were planning on splitting rent and utilities evenly but now I feel that since they want to take two rooms, they should be paying at least a little bit more. I feel bad because the baby was unexpected and they don’t make much money currently, but my boyfriend and I are trying to save up for our wedding and have student loans to pay off among other things.

0,"AITA for not forfeiting the diapers? | My local Walmart is pretty much always out of the diapers my son wears. Apparently a lot of people buy the size 3 Parent's Choice. But hey, who can blame them, they're great quality and super affordable.

Anyways, I'm making my way down the diaper aisle and a woman is sorta loitering around. She sees me coming and shuffles out of the way. She's on her phone and asks someone to come help her get diapers down. As usual, they were out, and I was prepared to bite the bullet and get the stupid Huggies.

But wait! There was a straggler pack waayy in the back on the middle shelf (too high for most people to reach, including myself). Without hesitation, I kinda squeezed in underneath and pushed it across the metal bars to the front with my phone. Took a bit of wrangling, but I eventually got it.

I was so friggin happy, I turned to leave the aisle, only to see the woman from earlier staring at me with disgust. With impeccable timing, the person she was presumably asking for help with on the phone earlier shows up to offer assistance. She tells him never mind and angrily stuffs a bag of Huggies into her cart.

I got out of there as fast as I could; I try to avoid confrontation like the plague. Should I have given them up to her because technically she was there first? She could have just as easily gotten them with my method, but I guess she didn't think of it...

We have two kids (5 and 7) who are great, but very messy. I struggled during the week to clean up after them, on top of laundry, dishes, pick ups and drop offs, extra curriculars, and spending time with my kids on top of that.

My wife is mad because she came home to a messy house. She nit picked because there were dishes in the sink, dirty laundry, messes from some activities with the kids, and the trash wasn't taken out. I told her I got our kids through the week alive and happy so she should be happy and now we can take care of the leftover mess together, but she's pissed because when I go away, she gets pretty much everything done. I told her we are different people with different thresholds and just because she can do it doesn't mean I can.

1,"AITA for refusing to pay for a laptop my daughter ""broke""? | My niece, Samantha (19), has always been a prickly girl but I never quite expected this. My husband and I have been visiting family and while we have been spending time sight seeing and spending time with my sister, Samantha has been babysitting our child. I use the word babysitting very lightly here. My daughter (Lila) is very quiet and well behaved and babysitting basically consists of being in the same house as her while she plays games on her phone, reads or watches TV. Lila is not loud or very boisterous, so it's not a big deal. Despite this Samantha kicked up a real fuss when she was asked to look after her and demanded compensation, saying that expecting her to help out was unfair unless she was getting paid. For reference Samantha isn't a social butterfly and she basically lives at her computer, and I believe she did all of this just to be rebellious and cause a fuss, but that's besides the point. Just providing some context about her character .Her mother ended up paying her in the end and aside from some initial grumbling when we left the first few times, things settled down. Until a few days ago.

We arrive and Lila is crying and Samantha is in HYSTERICS, claiming that my daughter went into her room while she was in the bathroom and spilled soda all over it and now it's completely ruined. She shows us the laptop and it won't turn on at all. She then doesn't ask but tells my husband and I we WILL be paying in full for new one. Now, here's the thing: one, Lila absolutely hates soda. Hates it. Fizzy things make her feel sick and she outright refuses to drink anything but water. Samantha, on the other hand, guzzles it down like it's nothing and easily goes through 2L a day. Two, Lila is a small girl and is nowhere near big enough to somehow get up onto a bed or desk just to upturn soda on it. We asked Samantha where her laptop up and she said on her desk. How on earth was Lila meant to get up to her desk to begin with? It's taller than she is. Three, as I recall Samantha had a big history of lying as a little girl blaming other people for what she did. She would break something and immediately point fingers at somebody else and I don't see that having changed. Four, Lila insists she didn't do anything and she didn't even leave the living room. I trust my daughter.

My husband wanted to give in despite all of this but I put my foot down and refused. I'm very confident that it was Samantha, not Lila, who ruined her own laptop and she just saw my daughter as a convenient way to get a new one from us as her mother doesn't have a lot of money. I don't want to enable that behavior or make Lila feel as though I don't believe her. My husband agrees that he thinks Lila is innocent and my sister told Samantha she was out of line to shout at us demanding money, but this has caused a big ripple throughout the family and Samantha has stormed off to her fathers house and now he's hassling my sister over it all.

0,"AITA for making an old man leave a bar, because we thought he was out of line? | More of an “are we the assholes”. My partner (26F) and I (28M) (both Aussie) aggressively spoke to a 70yo male American which caused him to leave the bar.

We had been sitting there in a quiet bar in Hue Vietnam, the bartenders are really friendly and chatted to us on and off. Then this loud af American guy comes in and only speaks to the female bartender who is fairly attractive. He says to her “You sit with me and I will buy 100 drinks. We sit and drink together”.

For the next hour he orders Long Island ice teas for himself and is trying to persuade the bartender to drink as quickly as possible. Without her being able to get a word in he also talks to her about America and how he can help get a visa etc below are some of the things he said.

“In America, you woman, him man both work in bar. You get paid exactly the same. That’s the law”

“The government pays you to study. If you come over you can get a job in any nail salon easily.”

“In my medium sized home town we have a shopping mall. You know the mall you have here every town in America has bigger one just as big”.

“They love me back at the hotel. I bought them all shoes so they adore me now.”

“My church won’t stop giving me money to help people here. Like I get off a flight and I have 5 emails from my church asking to give me more money.”

He also mentions the fact he is 70 years old all the time. Eventually the bar gets a little busier and the woman has to serve other customers. He continues to watch her and try to get her to sip his drink every time she comes past. Eventually another couple sit next to him and he starts spouting the same BS. He said to them “I once owned a big motorbike, so you know I’m not the kind of person you want to mess with”

We finally snapped when he said, “I’m hearing that all of the women in Australia are turning into men. Ya, know like they are just becoming more masculine”.

We pipe up and call him out on that he says “I’m sorry if I’ve offended you” we tell him he doesn’t need to come to this country and “save” people and he is out of line. He finishes his drink pays his bill and leaves saying “I don’t need this shit”

1,"AITA for giving my sister my girlfriend's necklace and getting mad when she demanded it back? | I have a girlfriend who I've dated for like 3 years now. She has this gold locket that she's had since she was like 9. It's from this disney series and it's in the shape of a heart with a keyhole sort of shape. It's a nice locket, and it's pretty unique too. But to me, it's just a necklace. My girlfriend hasn't been wearing it for awhile now because she said she needed to get gold chain for it. I told her she already has a chain. But she apparently can't wear it because it's made of silver, and she's ""allergic"" to silver. I don't know how anyone can be allergic to silver, since it's in a lot of things. So she's been planning on getting a gold chain, which in my opinion, is a waste of money. The locket itself is made of actual gold, so why waste more on it.

So she hasn't been wearing it. And my sister visited us. I've been worried about her, to show I still care for her health and such, I gave her my girlfriend's locket as a gift. My sister loved it, and she's not allergic to silver and thought it was cute.

When my girlfriend came home, she ended up finding out I gave away her lock. She demanded I go retrieve her locket. I said no, and she decided to go get the locket back from my sister. My sister called me crying, telling me my girlfriend stole the locket from her. I told my girlfriend she should give the necklace back. My girlfriend told me to f right off and said the necklace was special. I told her it's just a necklace, she can buy a new one if she wants. She said it's the only one like this. And that this necklace holds a lot of meaning to her. I told her that makes no sense, since it's just from a disney game with mickey mouse and other characters. She blew up on me and called me an f-ing thief. I told her we're a couple, her stuff is my stuff also. She threatened to sell my stuff if I ever touched her necklace or anything ever again. I told her she's over reacting, that the necklace is better suit for a child since it's so childish to get mad over a necklace.

0,"AITA for bragging about my life to former classmates? | I (28F) recently went on a reunion trip with my old highschool class. Since others also brought respective companions with them, I brought along my son (2M) and daughter (4F). My husband (28M) also came because he was my highschool classmate.

Since our class couldn't come up with one vehicle for our whole class and their companions, we decided to split up in groups and share our cars for those who don't own one.

My husband and I decided to offer our car (8-seater Toyota Land Cruiser). In the car with us were three of his old friends (28-29F), who were all law school graduates. 

Before graduating, I was an honor student who also planned to go to law school but after getting married at 23 and having children the following year, I wasn't able to.

The trip starts and as we were driving to our destination, husband's old friends start interrogating me about my job and mocking how I wasn't able to go to law school. They started questioning why I decided to get married and have children at a young age. Assuming my salary and belittling me for not being a lawyer (even if they weren't lawyers themselves). Calling out my expensive bags and clothing, saying that I should use the money to buy groceries and necessities.

All three of them are broke and jobless and are living off their parents because they haven't passed the bar exams yet. 

After around two hours of trying to be patient with them, I snapped after they said that I set up my children for a life of hardship because I couldn't afford giving them a better life. 

I told them that I am in no way bringing my children up in a hard life, that I'm not financially unstable at all. I work at a bank as an international staff and earn six-digits a year (which is a lot when converted into our currency). My daughter goes to an exclusive international school, my son set to go to the same one once he starts preschool. 

I own expensive clothing and bags as an investment, for reselling once I stop using them. They also served as a motivation for me when I was still financially struggling.

I have a house in a great subdivision, three cars, and a lot saved up for the future and could probably live off of the money I put aside from when I started working.

My husband and I worked incredibly hard to get to where we are now even if we're young and for them to say things like that really offended me. Just because I wasn't able to go to law school doesn't mean I am not able to lead a successful life. It made me even more upset that they're being rude and condescending in front of my children.

After saying all of this, they quiet down and refused to ride in our car once our trip ended. It made me incredibly guilty knowing that I probably hurt their feelings bragging about what I've achieved when they haven't reached that state in their lives yet.

A few months ago, Natalie (sister) invited everyone except my daughter Evie to her daughter Lucy's 10th birthday party. Her reason? Apparently Evie ''bullies'' Lucy. Nat has been saying this for years but I've yet to see any physical evidence of it. 

Evie is 13. She isn't a bad kid at all, but I don't think anyone can name a 13 yo who is nice all the time. She's a very pretty girl, has lots of friends and is top of her class, and has never been in any serious trouble at school, so I strongly doubt she's a bully. In all honesty, everything is called bullying nowadays. Evie is called a bully because she might have made a few mean jokes about Lucy over many years. It's never been any more serious than that and I would deal with it immediately if it was. Maybe Nat should teach
her daughter that she won't get anywhere in the world by crying when things don't go her way. She'll be a teenager soon too, and it's a tough world.

Evie wasn't bothered about not being invited to a 10 year olds party, but I thought it was offensive to exclude every single child *except her*. That in itself is humiliating, especially as I don't doubt Nat will have happily told everyone why Evie wasn't invited. 

In response, I decided not to invite them to Christmas dinner. My husband was absolutely fuming when I told him this, but when I said my reasons - that people who went out of their way to exclude/humiliate our child aren't welcome in our home - he now agrees, but his mother and brother have been calling us non-stop, saying it would be cruel to exclude them from the family Christmas traditions.

I've been considering going to a food bank as that would make a huge difference. Mainly so we have canned food or snacks lying around, but I'm not sure if this is appropriate since I'm not starving or homeless.

I asked my BF if this would be okay with him, and said that if it isn’t then I will gladly tell them not to come. He said it’s fine as long as they stay in their hotel and don’t expect us to plan around them. We all agreed. 

My two friends (Jane and Ryan) got their own hotel room about 20 minutes from us. We all flew separately and the agreement was we had two events planned together that week that my BF had agreed to. The plan was they’d do their own thing and we would join if we wanted to, save for those two events (a dinner and hike). 

A week before going, my BF said he didn’t want them to go. I explained it’s too late, they have their tickets and all we can do is suck it up for the hike and dinner and not see them otherwise. We got into a fight about this as he said I’m inconsiderate but honestly it’s not like I could ask them to cancel their flight. If he didn’t want them coming, he should’ve said so in advance. 

During the first group event (the hike) my BF was really rude to my friends. I was upset with him for it because it was unnecessary and it caused a fight. Honestly, we had been fighting the whole trip. The first night we fought because he was upset I wanted to have dinner instead of unpack first the fight night. The second day we fought because he was rude about how I looked (saying I need to lose weight) and then we fought about my friends being there (which he agreed to have them come).

I called my friends and they agreed to come get me. But before they got there I went to my BF and apologized. I said I love him and want to work this out if he does. He said this is a great time for a break up because a new expansion of the video game he is playing (he’s in his 30s) is coming out so it’s best I go. And so I did.

Two days later he told me he wants money for the hotel that he paid for. But I didn’t stay there either since I left with my friends and the agreement from the beginning was he was going to pay for the hotel, not me.

""There's a park next door!""

""I love kids, I really do""

""The people in the apartment before you had kids and they were very noisy""

Look over at six year old, she's sitting on the floor reading a book. ""There's no one jumping around up here, just vacuuming.""

""Please keep the noise to a minimum.""

As a result of this I sometimes make some food or bake something at home and bring it to my parents or my girlfriends parents and they always adore it to the extend where my dad will actively be disappointed when I do not bring something to eat when I visit. My girlfriends parents(And extended family) are not as direct about it, but usually whatever I bring does not even survive the first 15 minutes because by that time her cousins, brothers, sisters, father, uncles, mom etc will have already eaten it all. Now I obviously don't mind this, it is why I bring food and baked goods, for them to enjoy, also it beats just picking up a bottle of wine every time we visit, you know?

This leads us to yesterday where my parents asked me if it was alright if for this year they could celebrate Christmas at our place(and me cooking) instead of going to theirs and my mom cooking(This would naturally include direct family like my 2 siblings, their partners, grandparents and my nephew.) I told them that I would need to discuss it with my girlfriend first. Well apparently my girlfriend got a similar call the day before and roughly said the same to her parents. Now me and my girlfriend talked about it but we simply do not have the room to host both our families in our 2 bedroom apartment and in the best case scenario there is space for 15 people if I am willing to cook with my dick pressed against the counter top, so more realistically 10 people. Now my girlfriends direct family would number about 8 people and mine 11 people, so hosting both is simply impossible. So instead we decided to ask my parents if it was alright to use their house(Enormous house with a giant separate kitchen) and invite my girlfriends family as well, my parents agreed and it seemed to be arranged but logically I asked them to specify who would come since I didn't want to make any mistakes and as you can imagine cooking for so many people will be hellish.

Now this is where the real issue is, we added them to a Whatsapp group and they sent their lists of who they asked to come as well and this pretty much includes everyone and their second cousin. I am talking Uncles, Aunts, Cousins, their partners, Weird Bob that always shows up at family gatherings yet no one knows if he is actually related to us, hell my girlfriend's brother even invited people from his wife's family. Now I was counting on cooking for at most like 20 or so people but at the rate this shit is going we are talking upwards to 70 people. I am not a fucking catering company, I am hardly comfortable cooking for 20 people even with my mom, girlfriend and sister helping, I don't even know how I am supposed to cook for 70 people in a house kitchen.",False,False,3,4,2,3,1,4,Fairness|Proportionality

0,"AITA for not giving my parents money | My parents are not finically well off and haven’t been since I was about 11 (I’m 22 now). My dad got involved with drugs and other illegal activities, and blew their (my parents) entire savings on who knows what. We had nothing. The last vacation we ever took as a family, my dad blew $8,000 in Mexico in a week. Suffice to say I do not trust him with money. He has also been unemployed since I was about 13 or 14 and is on welfare.My mum works at a daycare, but is currently on EI. 

I got my first job at 12, as a paper delivery person, mainly so I could have some money to go to the mall with my friends. The law stated that because I was under 16, my pay cheques had to be made out to my mum, and then she could transfer the money into my account. This would have been fine if it wasn’t for the fact that my dad had access to her checking account, and would drain it on a weekly basis. 

When I was 16, my granddad took me to open my own bank account, at a different bank from my parents. We told my mum, but kept my dad in the dark. He found out when he stole cash from my wallet and saw a new bank card. Since then he would use threats of violence and emotional manipulation tactics to get me to give him my money. I told my mum, but she never did anything. I was 16, what else was I supposed to do? 

I have been consistently employed since then with several different jobs, and despite my best efforts, I’ve never had more than a couple thousand dollars in the bank at a time. I’ve calculated how much my parents have taken from me since I started working, and it’s well over $10,000. 

My parents still regularly ask me for cash, and I keep telling them no. When I do give my them money for say groceries, at best they get chips and ice cream. At worst, my dad comes home with nothing, including the cash. I’m tired of my hard earned money being wasted. I work three jobs and am in school full time. I deserve every penny I make. 

I have told my parents if they need something, I will go buy healthy groceries for them, or go with them to the bank to make a direct payment for the internet, or something like that. But I will not give them cash or put money into their account. My dad tells me I’m being unreasonable, saying how family should help family, no questions asked, that I’m taking away their right to independence and that by not giving them money I’m leaving them with nothing for “just in case.” My mum tells me that she understands my frustration, but it would be easier on everyone if I just gave him the money. I’ve told them that if this continues I will cut them off completely, but I’m being told that I’m overreacting and clearly don’t care about the importance of family. Am I over reacting?

0,"WIBTA for telling my Mum that I will no longer be complying with her ridiculous cleaning rules? | My (23F) Mum (50F) had an operation last week - as such, she is unable to do much until she has recovered, which is likely to be within 2 weeks. 

I live at home with my parents and 18 year old brother. I work part-time in retail, while also being a full-time uni student in my second year. My brother is also a full-time student in his first year, however he does not have a job. Due to the way my timetable is scheduled, I am currently in my 5th week of a 6 week intensive course - so I have a LOT of homework I should be doing, on top of also working throughout the week. My brother is only in his 3rd week out of a 12 week block, so he has less of a immediate need to be studying everyday. 

Since her operation, my Mum has left all her responsibilities to me. She expects me to mop and vacuum the downstairs portion of our house twice a day (this takes me at least half an hour each time), she also expects me to do the whole family’s washing everyday (sometimes, this is 6 loads a day), she wants me to make her lunch and the whole family dinner, go do the grocery shopping, clean the bathrooms, vacuum our staircase and rooms upstairs, pack and unpack the dishwasher etc. All this would be fine if I was currently on uni holidays, as I’d have the time to manage it, however, I am feeling extremely overwhelmed and stressed as I have two major assignments due next week that I have not been able to start because I have been slaving away every single day. 

Last night, I finally hit breaking point. After doing EVERYTHING she asked yesterday, she complained that I hadn’t washed her favourite pyjamas and she wanted to wear them immediately. She was very passive-aggressive with me and brought up the fact I hadn’t yet washed her pyjamas 5 times in an hour.

I at first thought I didn’t hear her right. She continues going into the details of “Yeah. You have really good credit so I thought it would help.” 

I just stayed silent during most of the conversation not quite sure of what to say as she talked what she would use the $25,000 she would get for the bank for.

1,"AITA For not doing the dishes after my wife cooks | Some context here. We have the household chores split pretty evenly to begin with. I don't like to cook, while my wife loves doing it. So I do some extra stuff around the house to balance out the chores scale some.   


When I cook for us (about once a week) I don't use many pots/pans/etc and clean as I go, leaving very little remaining to be cleaned. I also don't mind helping to load and unload the dishwasher. 

My wife has taken to cooking meals with a lot of prep and work lately, that seem to use every damn pot/pan in the house, and then some. It's not always just for the two of us (we have no kids) as she often makes very large batch items so she can take them to work for lunches or she makes things to take to work to share. She will not clean as she goes, so she ends up with quite a mess at the end of her creation.

When she does this, I often (but not always) help get what fits into the dishwasher in, but after that, if it requires washing by hand, she's on her own (I wash my own dishes that require handwashing, too). Thing is, she uses a LOT of dishes that require handwashing lately, and has been griping quite a bit at me for not helping her/outright doing 'her' dishes myself. 

I tell her that the chores are balanced as they are, and since it seems/feels to me like she's treating cooking as a hobby, she can clean up after herself, like she would any other hobby (like I am expected to, after my hobbies). 

This hasn't gone over well and is starting to cause a problem. I feel I already do enough and she feels that after spending ""all afternoon cooking"" that she shouldn't have to spend ""all evening cleaning"".

1,"AITA for not helping my daughter pay for college and not co-signing a loan? | My daughter is turning 18 in two weeks. She is starting college this fall. She has been accepted into 8 universities but has gotten little to no aid from any of them. The government didn't give her any aid either since our income is apparently too high. My daughter got into her dream school after being waitlisted. She was really happy to start college there this fall, but she has no money. I don't really feel like I have to pay for her college; she's an adult she should start paying for things on her own. She has no money saved up, because her mom has discouraged from getting a job until this spring. She has been working at a local bakery, but only has very little saved up for college. 

The university my daughter wants to go to is $17,000 after the small amount of aid they gave her. She's planning on studying biology, then going to PA school. My daughter's uncle and grandparents have promised to pay $5,000 of her tuition. My daughter plans on having $4,000 saved up by September. But it still isn't enough.  My daughter thinks I am unfair for refusing to pay the rest or at least cosigning a loan. She says she has no other way to pay for college, and that I am taking away her chance of going to a university. I don't need any extra debts by signing a loan, but my daughter thinks I am being stingy. 

My daughter is very mad at me and has been for weeks. My birthday was two weeks ago and my daughter refused to get me anything even though my wife offered to pay (didn't really matter to me, but I thought she was being a little bit overdramatic.).  She has also told me she will never spend a penny on me, or give me anything, unless I help her get a loan for college. She says I'm the only person she knows who could co-sign a loan for her, but I just don't want to.

 I don't understand why she is being so dramatic. I have encouraged her to start at a community college since she'll have enough saved for that. That makes her even more mad, because she wants to go to her ""dream school"". Also she says she can't stand me anymore, wants to move out asap, and rent in our city will end up costing her more than the price of going to her dream school (that part is probably true).

I feel like this issue is tearing up our family. My daughter desperately wants to go to her dream school, but she's short of $8,000-ish dollars. I don't want to give her any money, or cosign a loan.

For clarity, my BF and I have been together for over 4 years and live together.

I don't fully understand it, but I do understand that she is insanely muscular and strong. She had to learn how to sew because no clothes fit her due to the amount of muscle and her skeletal structure.

She is very, very facially pretty but guys only tend to ask her out when we're sitting down and she's hiding her muscles under shapeless clothes. When she goes on dates and wears her more fitted clothes, there generally isn't a second date and she complains that the guys who *are* interested make uncomfortable comments about her body. Stuff like they want to eat off her stomach, they want her to fuck them while she's holding them up, they want her to get more muscular, etc. It makes her feel like a fetish rather than a person.

She doesn't generally complain about it, and when she does it's in the form of jokes and she doesn't go on and on about it, but she's definitely insecure.

Now my girlfriend and her children have been living in this house for about 8 years.  I moved in about 3 years ago. 

The room that was D's bedroom in our house is a bit bigger  than her younger brother's room so he is going to switch to the bigger room at some point (he is extremely lazy and has not done it yet, but  that is beside the point).  Around Thanksgiving D come in for the  holiday and tells her mom if we don't leave her old room like it is so she can stay in it when she comes for a visit, we will have to pay for a  hotel room for her when ever she decides to visit.

D got mad when I laughed at her and said ""That is funny! Not going to happen, but Funny!""

She doesn't seem to get the idea that she moved out, her old room is no longer her room.  Her mom and I are free to do whatever we want with her old room.

And if we went to the area when D lives I would not expect D to pay for a hotel room for us as she only has a 1 bedroom apartment.",False,False,2,4,3,3,1,4,Fairness|Proportionality
0,"AITA for making my roommate's friend leave our room? I | I live in a dormitory, 3 of us (me (19F) and my two other roommates (19F and 18F) ) share a single room. Our beds are about a metre apart from each other, so there's barely any personal space.

There's a little problem with one of my roommates (let's call her A). Multiple times she has invited her friends over without telling us, even though we have a groupchat. It's always sudden, and her friends leave extremely late (one time her friends decided to leave at 1:30 am on a Thursday). Since there's pretty much no space in our room, if A invites 4 people, they sit around on our beds, which is annoying. We tried talking to her that this shouldn't be happening, but she acts really selfish and disregards our interests.

Now imagine this. It's Monday. Me and the other 19 year old roommate (let's call her S) leave in the morning, while A decides to sleep in. I return back to our room at about 3pm, A is still in bed and she tells me that she decided not to go to university today. Understandable. I leave the dorm again, go to library to study, and then return at about 7:30. S is already at the room. At 8pm there's knocking on our door, and one of A's friends (let's call her V) comes in. Alright, it's not that late, she can hang out here I guess, it would've been nice for A to let us know that she's inviting V over though. They talk, loudly. For some reason, sitting 30cm apart means that they have to yell at each other. S and I talked recently that we should tell A once again that this shouldn't be happening, but now it would be too awkward to tell her 'Hey, you should be more considerate of us, we never invite anyone over without telling you'. Well, as 9 pm approaches, they decide to start singing. I message S that maybe V will leave soon, since you know, it's Monday and 3 of us have lectures at 9am tomorrow. That doesn't happen. At about 10 pm S and I finish getting ready for bed, are in our pyjamas, skincare done, makeup off, but A and V don't get the hint – they bring out a guitar. Now A is playing her guitar and V is singing. Anyways, at 10:45 I say ""Hey, it's almost 11pm. Maybe it's enough?"" I'll admit and say that I said it sternly, since I was genuinely pissed off. Well, V giggles and leaves and A decides (probably just to spite me) to play her guitar for another half an hour before she starts getting ready to go to sleep. I was pretty angry considering that she decided to just fuck around the entire day and invite V over late at evening even though she could've hanged out with her during the day.

Well, recently I found out that V is telling everyone in our faculty that I'm hysteric and I screamed at her and made her leave, she just changed the little detail and said that it was 9pm, and not 11. I'm trying my best to look at this from A's and V's perspective but I just can't. I feel like the previous times when she was selfish by letting her friends stay this long clouded my perception.

0,"AITA for banning my girlfriend from using my moisturizer? | The guys in my family all have oily skin and unfortunately I’m no exception. I’ve spent an incredible amount of time and money on trying to find moisturizers that work for me but it’s been rough (especially because it’s hard to find moisturizers for men that isn’t the purified cow dung that is Axe or something similar) but recently I found a great lotion that’s literally perfect for my skin.

I noticed that it seems to be rapidly running out but I thought nothing of it because when my GF stays the night she uses it as well. I resIgned myself to the possibility of having to buy it semi-regularly because of this. I won’t bother y’all with the details but basically I walked in on her squeezing out a massive dollop of the cream, far beyond the realm of necessity. My eyes bulged out of my head before I stuttered “what....the hell are you doing?” Initially she looked confused but then I pointed to the mountain of cream on her hand and just asked why. She said she needs it for her whole body. I said that that’s exclusively meant to be for your face and I have a separate body lotion for that purpose. She said nah that’s too much effort and there’s no difference. I said that I’m not going to pay 60 dollars for you to waste it. She shrugged and didn’t say anything else & I let it go because I thought she got the message.

Fast forward to today. I nabbed her in the act AGAIN, so I decided to take radical measures and place it on a shelf above the cupboard where she can’t reach cause she isn’t tall enough. She asked why I did it and I said because you don’t respect me nor my belongs enough to do as I ask. She said she likes using that one. I said well too bad you said the body lotion is the exact same as the face lotion so you can use that one no problem or even bring your own.

0,"AITA for not wanting to make monthly payments on a Christmas present given to me. | Ok first time poster here so let me know if I’m doin this right

My (ex)boyfriend bought me an iPad last Christmas.  He ordered it early but wouldn’t let me open until Christmas “so my family could see.” He put it on our joint Verizon account, but never told me how much it was or about monthly payments, etc.

We broke up in April and he kept saying “I want to make sure you get to keep the iPad.” Repeatedly. I mistook this as him trying to be nice because I’m an illustrator and the iPad is like my baby now I love it so much.

After the breakup he was stalking me through the location services on our joint Verizon account. And harassing me and my friends about where I was. He had done this previously in the relationship as well and I was generally freaked out at this point.

My family urged me to separate the account so he couldn’t track my phone anymore, so we went to Verizon to figure it all out. 

But when he kept saying “I want to make sure you get the iPad” what he really meant was “I want to make sure you have to pay for the iPad now.”

I didn’t understand that until we were already in the Verizon store. The lovely Verizon people notified me that my credit wasn’t even good enough to take on the iPad payment plan. (Student loans fml)

So now he insists I pay him the monthly payments until the payment plan is completed and he no longer owes. It still has several months left and I honestly want no contact, but because of this I have to communicate still to give him money.

It seems petty and I try to be a good person, but it really bothers me that I now make monthly payments on a PRESENT. Sure I love the iPad and I wanted one, but he bought it of his own free will so why do I have to pay for it? He also makes more money than me and after the breakup I let him keep the house and have been couch surfing until I move next month.

0,"WIBTA: Considering Dumping Boyfriend Over Money Issues | The background: I'm American and my boyfriend is Chinese so needless to say, there are a lot of cultural differences. We both tried to be respectful of how our backgrounds influence our ways of interacting with the world and our expectations of a relationship. We've been dating seriously for 2 years and have talked about things like marriage, children, etc. and at one point he proposed but I didn't feel ready. Recently, we've hit a snag. 

&#x200B;

In short, his family is pretty bad with money. They take out lots of high interest loans (in the ballpark of $300,000 USD) and make a lot of speculative investments that usually go awry. He personally has a pretty strained relationship with them and the last time he lived with the he was 12 (military boarding school...). Recently we got into a pretty big fight because his parents paid for some of his college and expect him to pay them back REALLY quickly. They want him to send them $12,000 a year for the next three years (so $36,000 in three years). He currently makes $65,000 a year and lives in a super expensive US city. In addition, they also expect him to pay for his brother's college education when he goes to college in about 8 years. It has caused a lot of stress in our relationship because there are things I would like to do, like travel, that he simply can't and probably won't be able to do until his mid-thirties (in addition, to not being able to save much money for expenses). I have offered to pay for these things but that's a whole different shit show. In addition, I don't think it's fair that he has to both pay back his parents and pay for his brother and I also feel frustrated that it's going to impact both our current ability to do fun/interesting things and down the road might impact our ability to pay for a mortgage and/or college for our kids. I've tried to talk with him about this but I feel like I'm overstepping a cultural boundary and that it's not my place to dictate the relationship he has with his parents. At the same time, I can't afford to support both of us and I'm scared about our ability to save money as well as have financial freedom. 

&#x200B;

As someone who grew up financially insecure, I'm kinda freaking out and my gut reaction is to bail on the relationship.

I will address my sister from the family who adopted me as ‘step sister’.

Recently my (53M) sister (41F) unfortunately passed away due to reasons I’d rather not disclose. Because I’m the only living direct relative (parents were not in the picture either as children) she put me in her will and nobody else’s. She had a very well paying job and whilst I am not saying how much she gave me it was certainly enough to let me live without a job for the rest of my life. 

When my sister and I were younger and living with our adopted family, she was an absolute bitch to the both of us. She was never ever kind, always making horrible remarks and insults and always got us into trouble when we didn’t do anything. This continued right up until we moved out in our early 20s. She never apologised and we never spoke again. 

For context, my step sister lives in a NYC penthouse (right in SoHo).

Recently my step sister has gotten in contact with me and told me she is currently struggling in life as she recently was fired (she’s not telling me why). She’s asking me to share some of my sister’s money and I am constantly saying no because I don’t feel she deserves it.

My husband and I had been looking for a roommate for about a month and a half. We texted all our friends and even made ads on Craigslist and Reddit. One of our friends responded pretty quickly. 

She told us her situation at home was overwhelming and she'd love to be roommates. We agreed and wrote up a roommate agreement. We also set up a date so she could come over and see the place before making a decision. 

Well, she never came over. She started making excuses to not come over whenever we'd set up other dates. Our deadline was coming up pretty soon so we were really desperate to get a concrete yes from her. 

A couple days ago she texted my husband and said that we were actually her backup plan in case she couldn't get the place she applied for. She hadn't told us this from the start and only just sprung it on us as we neared our deadline. I was upset. 

I tried one last time to get her to come over but she didn't answer at all. So when I got an offer from a family member I was eager to accept it. This was a concrete plan in my eyes. We hashed out the details and now that family member is ordering her furniture to our address. 

I told my husband to let the friend know that we no longer needed a roommate and that she'd have to find another backup plan. He told her, but left the option of still moving in open to her. He said we'd figure it out if she needed a place to stay. 

I was livid at this point. I told my husband that she needed to find another backup because there was no way she could live on our couch. She repeatedly missed dates and wasn't honest in the beginning. He said I was overreacting and that she's a friend in need.

I quickly made friends and started dating one of the locals. He and I had our own set of friends but we'd all hangout together.

She lives in the uni hostels and I rented a studio apt next to uni but because we spent all our time together she just moved in with me. She paid for nothing (no rent, bills, expenses) I didnt mind because it wasnt a big deal. As I said things were cheap.
My boyfriend, his friends and my friends would hangout at my place most of the time. One specific friend we'll call him Jack started a thing with Emy which led to her having feelings for him.
Emy was in a different faculty and had her own schedule so she couldnt spend time with us most of the time. Because of how often they came I started to get to know the type of person Jack is. In summary hes a playboy.
I tried warning Emy about Jack and she said that I was overreacting and that it's fine for him to see other people because ""they're not official yet"", but she was very protective of him.

I always end up pay for 4 people (me, my boyfriend, jack and any new girl he'd bring) and if they invited more friends id pay for them too.

0,"AITA For not letting my niece stay over with me? | Ok, so let me preface this by saying that I absolutely love my eldest niece (we'll call her ''M''), she's like my little sister. But my sister (her mom, we'll call her ''G'') takes advantage of that.

A little bit of backstory: ''G'' is married to this terrible guy 10 years younger than her and they have two girls under the age of 3 (''M'' is not his daughter). He's straight up not a nice guy, and complains all the time about having to take care of the two little girls and about ''M'' on a regular basis. Also, everyone in my family is a musician, meaning we work all day saturdays, and we're split into two groups ''M'' is in one, and ''G'' is in another one. ''G'' lives with my niece ''M'', the two girls and her husband in their own house. In my house there are currently 10 people living here.

Now, here goes:

I love it when ''M'' stays over. When she does, we sleep in my queen size bed, which I have to tidy up when she sleeps over, and I have no issue cleaning up my bed when she's staying under a direct invitation from me (we go to a lot of cons and outings that require her to stay over out of convenience). The big but, is that when we're working on saturdays ''G'' takes off and goes home and leaves ''M'' here, with no regard of where she'll sleep, and she usually ends up sleeping with me, which means I have to clean up my bed even though I was not expecting ''M'' to stay over. Mind you, we regularly finish working late, so this happens at like 1 or 2 A.M. ''G'' says she's tired and wants to sleep, like I'm not tired too. 

&#x200B;

''G'' does this almost every week without consulting anyone and ''M'' just shows up and stays because ''G'' couldn't be bothered to pick her up after work (it's a family business), and the only reason I put up with it is because I don't want her sleeping on the couch, given the fact that we're so crowded in here. It's not just for work either, ''G'' will have ''M'' come over to my house after a party, an outing, or something and she's just like ''Oh yeah, M is staying over. She's sleeping with you right?''

I feel like I'm being taken advantage of for permitting this. I don't mind having my niece over, I love her and I love her company, but I don't enjoy that her mom just drops her off whenever she feels like it. I could have ''M'' sleeping in my bed for a month, if I'm the one inviting her over, because when she stays over with me specifically, I take care of her every need, and when ''G'' does this, I feel like I'm being thrusted with a responsibility I don't want to take at the time. I can't possibly bring this up with ''G'' because if I do, she'll bad mouth me to ''M'' and I'll be the bad guy.

0,"WIBTA if I asked my fiancé to contribute a bigger share of the rent? | My fiancé makes significantly more money than I do  and currently we each pay for half of our rent. I have student loans and he doesn't, so after paying for those as well as my share of the rent and utilities I'm left with almost nothing, and I have no savings whatsoever. For him, his share of the rent is less than 10% of his monthly income, while it is nearly 30% of mine. However, because of the nature of his job, he goes away for two weeks at a time and then comes home for one week, so he's at the apartment for way less time than I am; while he's at work though, he has no expenses at all, as his laundry, meals and housing are all paid for by the company. I'm struggling a lot and it's been very stressful for me, but at the end of the day he's not in the apartment as much as I am, and it's his money and he works hard for it, so would I be the asshole if I asked him to pay for a bigger share of the rent since he's more financially stable?

0,"AITA for not wanting to make the wedding cake as a present for my sister’s wedding? | Sorry if this doesn’t make sense, I’m kind of mad.

My sister came over for Christmas Eve yesterday and I had made a really fancy cake for Christmas. While we were cutting the cake she said, “You can make the cake for our wedding, that can be your gift to us.” I said not even with any doubt no, I do not want to make a wedding cake, making and decorating a three layer cake is hard enough. She got offended by this like, “Don’t you care enough about us having a nice cake for our wedding?” Of course I care about her I said, but I work full time and I don’t want to spend time baking a wedding cake for a destination wedding that is already set out to be a pain.

Her fiancé jumped in at this point and accused me of being mad that it was a destination wedding. Mistake here probably, I said that having a destination wedding in an expensive area and expecting the whole family to pay a lot of money to come (and make the goddamn wedding cake!!) is kind of selfish. I would come to the wedding and buy her a really nice gift just like all the other guests, I’d participate in the wedding party if she wanted me to, I’d even help plan the wedding and help FIND a person to bake the cake, I just don’t want to spend days baking a cake that will probably taste like shit after being shipped 2000 miles anyway! I know she probably wants me to bake the cake because the kind of cake she wants (with very expensive ingredients) would cost like 700 dollars to feed so many people and she isn’t asking any of her other guests to spend 700 dollars on a gift. 

This was Christmas Eve of course so the whole family started getting involved, sort of a split between “sister is getting married and you shouldn’t be so selfish and you should bake her a cake because it would mean so much to everybody” and my other family members “she doesn’t have to bake an entire wedding cake if she doesn’t want to.” And suddenly I was the one who’d ruined Christmas by being so unreasonable, why couldn’t I leave the argument to another time? But what was I supposed to do, say “sure I want to bake your cake” and then after Christmas go around and say “actually no”?

0,"AITA for buying juice my roommate doesn't like and asking him to pay for broken property? | Sorry for the long post, but I felt that I needed to give as much context as possible so you guys could give a fair judgment.

Also thought it would be a good thing to mention that this roommate only lives with us because his dad is one of my roommate's uncles.

So I live with 4 other people in an apartment. One of them, who I will be talking about now acts like a child and is very annoying. Whenever he comes home, he goes to the fridge and pours himself a big mug of juice (because he can't be asked to wash a cup) then just watches TV. 

He also does this regularly throughout the day. Oh also forgot to mention he never goes shopping or contributes any money towards it. 

The juice finishes very quickly because of this, and when confronted about it starts whining that his girlfriend cheated on him. Now one thing I know about him is that he hates orange juice with bits in it. 

When I was out shopping, I bought 3 large cartons of orange juice with bits. When he came home earlier today he asked who went shopping. Someone told him I did and he proceeded to shout at me, asking why I bought juice I know he hates. 

I told him it was because he always finishes it and if he promised to start washing cups and not drink as much juice, I would buy him juice he likes. He still wasn't happy with this and had a tantrum, throwing stuff around and he even cracked my xbox by throwing another roommate's phone at it (we were the only two in the apartment), also managing to crack the screen of the phone. Now everyone has come back home to find the apartment in a state and roommate that did this is sulking in the toilet.

When he was done, I told him that he needed to pay for the stuff he broke while he had his tantrum. He then started crying, saying all his available money went towards rent and he was doing this because his girlfriend broke up with him.

I am starting to sort of feel sorry for him and he found out his girlfriend of 3 years was cheating on him a couple days ago. Also people think because he is poor that we should let him off. Also sorry for the long post. AITA?",False,False,3,4,2,2,1,3,Fairness
0,"AITA for accidentally interrupting a wedding procession on a boardwalk? | So yesterday I was walking up and down a public boardwalk playing Pokémon Go since it was Community Day. At one point I noticed there was a wedding congregation off to the side of the boardwalk in some grass since the boardwalk is very scenic in places being right next to the ocean.

The boardwalk runs east to west, so the wedding congregation was to the south of the boardwalk. I was walking by the congregation on the boardwalk looking at my phone catching Pokémon when suddenly some of the guests and venue staff (I guess they work for one of the buildings nearby) started yelling at me to get out of the way.

Initially I was extremely confused because I didn’t see anything to get out of the way of, so I gave the staff member a confused look and he pointed at something, which turned out to be the bride waiting off to the other side of the boardwalk (the north side to keep the geography consistent).

Now in my opinion there is no way I could have seen the bride off to the side unless I physically turned around because she was sort of hidden behind some plants. While I continued to walk I asked the staff member “where should I be walking?” and their response was again “get out of the way”. Again I asked “where should I walk?” and got the same response. 

At this point I decided the best way to get out of the way was just to continue walking until I was past the wedding but I was still getting shot dirty looks by the guests.

0,"AITA for outing my cousin to my uncle after she stole and ruined my expensive liquor? | Happened earlier this year when our uncle was visiting us.

So a few years back, my cousin (17 at the time) and a friend of hers (18 at the time) traveled about 400 kilometers for a music festival which lasted several days. During this time they stayed at my parents place, where I still live. I was the only one at home during this time as my parents and my sister were away for the week. Upon my parents insisting, I slept in their bedroom and let my cousin and her friend sleep in my room. Bad idea.

After the music festival had ended I gave them a ride to the train station and went back home to clean up a bit before the rest of the family comes home. I noticed bottles on my liquor shelf had been shifted, they were a mix of different variations of apple coqnag/brandy, with the cheapest of them being 75€ per liter. The most expensive one was 200€ per liter and I had a half a liter bottle of it.

Knowing that I too had been 17 at one point my life I had a creeping suspicion that the girls had stolen some of my liquor. I popped open the expensive one, and with one taste I could tell it was watered down. I was absolutely furious, I knew my cousin was spoiled rotten but going as far as stealing from family was too much. If she wanted to have a drink before going to the festival she should have asked me and not stolen from me. 

When my parents came home I confronted them about this and insisted we call my uncle and tell him what had happened, my dad didn't believe me and took my cousin's side in this matter. I dropped the subject after my dad surprised my with a similar bottle a few weeks later when he came from a work trip. I provided him with a taste sample of the diluted coqnag and the new bottle he had bought and he too noticed the difference but did not want to start an argument with his brother/extended family.

A year or two later my uncle and the cousin in question came to visit us, I was doing some schoolwork and joined their company a bit later. My uncle asked why I had been locked up in my room and I just jokingly said that I was hiding the liquor. He asked what I meant by that and I tried dodging the subject since it was already solved on my part. He kept pushing and asking about it so I told what had happened when my cousin last stayed at our house and my uncle was fuming. They left shortly after, my uncle thanked me for telling him about it but inquired why I had kept my mouth shut. I just told him that I was underage not too long ago. 

But the problem is, my parents consider me to be a major A-hole in this matter. They didn't even remember this whole thing happening and they couldn't believe how petty I was to hold onto a grudge like this. The problem is that this subject is always brought up in a discussion when we have a disagreement with my parents and they start saying stuff like *""MorriCC is so petty he'll probably remember for a decade/I hope you don't go snitching about this like you did with \[cousin's name\]""* and so on.",False,False,2,4,3,2,1,3,Fairness
0,"AITA for pouring water on my roommate's friend | Title is a little aimed at me being the asshole, but let me explain the situation.

I have had a dog for 4 years. Even though he was house trained he had an issue with peeing inside the house. The peeing happened at least 3 times a month and at this point our carpet is at the point where it needs to be replaced.

This last year my roommate (RM) was tired of it and told me to take him to the vet. I did and got all the tests that they recommended, urine, blood, stool, etc. Spending $100s and they deemed it to be a behavioral issue.

They also pointed out to me that it may be related to how much water he drinks. I mentioned that he has a big water bowl that I fill up multiple times a day and they advised that I tried getting a smaller bowl and only filling it up a little over half. So I did this and I monitored how much water I gave him very closely. After a while I noticed that he was definitely drinking more than he needed before. After months of trying this out he went from peeing a few times a month to no times. Only one incident in the last 3 months, due to me being gone longer than usual and him being excited when I got home.

Now comes my roommate's friend. She is not someone I am particularly fond of (*due to her using me as a resource and doing plenty of reckless things because she knew I can/would fix them when we were friends*), but my RM is a close friend so I tolerate and act courteous to her. Every time she comes over she fills my dog's water bowl up to the top. I told her the first time that she shouldn't do it and explained why with the vet appts and the vet's opinions along with my own testing on the situation. And she only replied with ""why does it matter?"" to which I explained that if he gets too much water then he will pee in our house and we don't want that. It didn't connect and we ended up arguing until my RM came in and sided with me. It ended there and I dumped and refilled the water properly.

Well now every time she comes over she fills the water bowl to the top to which I dump and refill. So after this continued (8 times now) one of the last time she was here I told her to leave my dog's water bowl alone and if I find it filled up to the top I will empty it on her before I refill it. Because I have a history of being a pushover she kind of just acknowledged the warning and went on with her day. A few days ago she was over again and she filled his bowl again to the top. Her and my RM were watching TV when I brought the full bowl over and dumped it on her. She was outraged by the whole thing, but overall I know she has no bite so I just stared her down and told her I warned her. My RM doesn't agree with what I did, but she knows how frustrating this has been for me and knows that her friend is doing the wrong thing.

1,"AITA for letting our dog pee on our neighbor's car | Never in my life have I thought this was not OK, but today I overheard something that made me think maybe this is an asshole move on my part. 

Me and my mom have adopted a dog two weeks ago. He's a great dog but he still needs time to adjust. One thing he's not used to yet is peeing in our yard. He needs to go outside the front gate to pee. Because we (mostly I) take him out to pee multiple times a day (he had some incidents), we don't put him on a leash. Instead I just follow him closely. 

Most of the time, he just pees on our fence or the lamp post but he LOVES peeing on car tires. When our front facing neighbor's (son's) car is outside, he will cross the street to pee on the tire (it's a small village with minimum traffic, so this is not like dangerous or anything. Plus I'm there). I didn't think much of this. 

But today I was out with him, letting him pee, when our neighbor's son and his wife arrived by car. His wife seemed to look at us weird. Then, later during the day, I was inside my room with the window open, and heard them running after their escaped dog, when the wife, loud enough for me to hear, asked her husband - ""Do you know what dog has been peeing on our car?""

Now, am I overthinking this, or did she want me to hear this? We live in the countryside, and unfortunately, stray dogs are common. Also other people walk their dogs in our street. So why would this bother her, unless she's sure it's our dog because she saw us today, and she minds us letting him pee on their car?

1,"AITA for wanting my fiancé to wear a family wedding dress instead of my sister? | I (27M) got engaged recently to my girlfriend of five years (27F) and she was discussing wedding dress plans with me—we don’t have a date yet but she is a big planner. Coincidentally, my older sister (30F) also got engaged within a week of me, this is relevant for the rest of the story.

I was talking with my fiancé and she expressed to me how she’s kind of upset that she’s not close to any of her immediate family (they treated her quite badly) so she will not have any family heirlooms to wear on her wedding day. that’s when I got the idea—my grandmother’s wedding dress has never been worn since her wedding day, and she has always expressed wanting one of her grandkids to wear it (I remember she emphasized that this would be for one time because it would have to be altered and it’s a very delicate dress apparently) 

I have no female cousins, and my own sister has always said to me she thought the dress was not modern enough/thought it was, in her own words, “extremely drab”, so I showed a picture to my fiancé and suggested it. My fiancé seemed thrilled at the idea of wearing it because she loves my grandma. 

I asked my grandma for her permission—she then says that my sister also asked to wear the dress a day after I did??? Apparently my sister had a change of heart because she doesn’t want to go out shopping for dresses anymore, and decided she can just wear grandma’s dress.

Now Grandma and the rest of my family is in favor of my sister wearing the dress because she’s actually a grandkid, which I said was unfair and cruel. I just don’t see why my sister should wear something she previously was so rude about instead of my appreciative fiancé. AITA?

1,"Aita for confiscating the gifts my ex husband gives our son? | Burner account*

I’m 36 years old and am married with a child of my own (13 M)and 3 step children (15 F, 14 M, 10F) . All 4 kids live with me and my husband. I have an ex husband who I will start referring to as X. My husband and I married 2 years ago, I have been divorced from X as of 5 years ago. We married at 20 and it just never was really going to work. Honestly surprised we made it 10 years.

We are not poor, but we do not spend frivolously. We have enough money for the life we live and that’s about it. No expensive vacations or anything like that. Now, X I guess came into a lot of money shortly after we divorced. He got a new job or something idk, we don’t talk. X takes our son for 2 weekends a month, and he ALWAYS comes back with something. Videogames and gaming accessories, shoes, sports equipment, clothes, shit even expensive colognes and a chain once. 

My husband and I cannot afford to spend on the kids like this, and the kids understand. They have what they need but ultimately they have to wait til Christmas or birthday if they want something like that. I’ve been seeing tension among the kids, my husbands kids have been getting upset about the constant gifts my son gets from X. My husband thinks it’s a little ridiculous too, like X is just trying to show off, but he’s not going to tell X what he can and can’t get for his own son. 

Since all the sheltering, my son hasn’t seen his father. But last week we got a prime package with X’s name on it. It was a gift for our son. Some game he wanted idk. Before giving it to our son, I decided this was going to stop. I called X and explained that it’s totally unfair to the other kids when they see him with all new things. And that if he wants to buy our son things they have to stay at his place. 

X roared at me “Just because your new husband can’t afford what I can for his own kids, I can’t give my son gifts? I worked hard for my money I can spoil my son if I want to, I don’t have to worry about your step kids feelings. I don’t have to buy my son less because you got remarried”

After that conversation, I really don’t know. X has every right to buy what he wants for HIS son, and my step kids aren’t his problem. But I still feel bad, I know they wonder why he gets all new stuff and they don’t.

1,"AITA for telling my boyfriend to ""stay in his lane?"" | My boyfriend and I got into an argument about one of my Instagram posts. We decided to ask you guys who's the asshole.

We've been dating for about three months now, but we'd previously dated for 7 months before breaking up. In that ""break"" period (neither of us saw or was interested in anyone else), I posted a photo of myself in a bikini on my Instagram; it's just the top half, and cuts off maybe half-way down my breasts. In other words; you can't really see the bikini top besides the straps and a part of one cup in the bottom-left corner. However, by that cup, you can see about 1/5 of my nipple.

Now, I am aware of this. And I was aware of it when I posted it. I originally posted other photos, but I got multiple comments saying my nipples were visible. It made me self-conscious (even though I wasn't initially bothered), I got into a fight with my sister and mom about it (not about the content; it's a long story), and I took them down. Then I replaced them with the current heavily cropped photo. I had texted my boyfriend (my then-ex) about the situation, looking for help and advice, but he said he had to go to sleep. I don't think it's obvious that it's a nipple; it looks vaguely like a shadow or a trick of the light. And I received no messages from people telling me that my nipple was visible in that photo. I liked that photo and I was proud of it.

This was four months ago. 

Today, my boyfriend was going through my Instagram photos (he likes to look at photos of me), and found that photo. He texted me and said, ""I think your nipple is still visible in this. Just faintly. Idk if you care, just letting you know."" And I said I did know and that I wish he hadn't reminded me of it because that was a really horrible night.

He apologized and said, ""The photo just makes me feel a little weird... as your boyfriend."" I told him I wasn't taking it down and that he didn't get to decide what I could and couldn't post. He said, ""I can't control what you do, I can only tell you what I feel."" So I told him to stay in his lane.

That spiraled pretty quickly. I maintain that it's not his place to tell me what I can and cannot post on Instagram, and he maintains that my nipples are a private space between the two of us. I told him I would've taken his opinion into account when I originally posted the photo - but not months afterwards. He says he's very uncomfortable with it. 

For more context: That was the first time I'd worn that swimsuit. It was too small for me. My mom took the photos. I am a legal adult. I have a private Instagram account with 508 followers that I generally restrict to people who are either my friends, family, or go to my school. I don't usually post ""promiscuous"" things; there are about 2 out of 96 photos that could potentially be deemed that - this photo included.

I got an Xbox One S about 3 years ago on my birthday and paid 3/4 of it with my own money. My dad paid the other 1/4 but I paid him back as soon as I was able to pay him. I get money from doing a lot of chores around the house because I like to clean things and things being clean are satisfying to me. I wanted an Xbox so I could play games with my sister together and with my friends. When my dad gave me 1/4 of the money for the Xbox, he told me my sister has to also play on it. I obviously agreed because I wanted to play with my older sister. We enjoyed playing together until we were stuck at home. Since that happened, all my sister has been doing is playing on the Xbox. I don't mind if she plays when I'm at school because I'm there for 6/7 hours a day and most of her friends are also online during that time because they also have no school. Once I have finished my homework it will be around 8/9 hours and she will still be on the Xbox. That's fine because she doesn't really disturb me while I am school and she is playing. Once I'm done with all my work I will ask her to play with me and she will say she can't because she is playing a single-player game and I would distract her if I was there. She will play until it is like 6 PM and then she will let me play. I will play for like an hour and a half before my parents tell me that I have played enough. But, they will let my sister come back and play until like 2 AM. None of my friends are online in this 6-7:30 time period. This just means that I will have to play games by myself which I don't enjoy too much. This has been going on for almost five weeks. I try to explain this to my parents and my sister but they say that she needs this gaming time to calm herself down from what's going on. I have tried to explain that I also want to play with my friends and it's not fair that only she gets to play. My dad reminds me that he paid for 1/4 of it every time this is brought up, even though I paid him back. Finally, I decided to put a password on the Xbox once you try to sign in to an account. I unlock it for her before I go to school so she can play and shut off the Xbox when I am done with all my work so if she tries to start the Xbox again she will have to put in the password. She complained to my parents that she cannot play after school because of the password but I put my foot down and told her that I will not give it to her because I can't play with my friends. 

I think I am being perfectly reasonable giving her around 8 hours to play when all of her friends are online and giving myself time to play as well.

0,"WIBTA if I told my dad his vacation planning hurt my feelings | I (25f) have a good relationship with my dad (54m) and my stepmom, who have been married 15 years as well as my brother (24m), my older half sister from his first marriage (38f) and my two younger half sisters (12f) from his current marriage. I consider them all my equal siblings and have put a lot of effort to keep in touch with everyone despite living in different cities.

Since my parents divorce, I've spent every other holiday with each of my parents (Thanksgiving with my mom and Christmas with my dad one year, then reversed the next, and so on). If we ever went on a family trip, my dad would usually buy all of the siblings plane tickets/accommodations/etc., which I recognize is very generous. When my older sister got married, he told her she would need to start buying her own flights. Between that and her now having children, she doesn't make it on as many family vacations. I've always been nervous about the same thing happening to me as I am now in a serious relationship and my bf (we moved in together a few months ago). 

Recently, when I was visiting my dad, we were hanging out in the living room with a group of people (both family and friends) and I saw a lot of library books for one country so I asked if one of my younger sisters was doing a school project. My dad responded that they were actually preparing for a trip him, my stepmom, and my little sisters were doing for Thanksgiving. 

I was surprised bc this year is my Thanksgiving with my dad and I planned on coming to his for the holiday. I hadn't heard anything about this trip. They had already booked flights and accommodations.  

My dad must have noticed my surprise bc he explained that if I wanted to join, I would have to buy my own flights and they would get me accommodations etc. This is more than fair to me but I feel hurt that they booked the trip without saying anything to me. They haven't sent me their flights or dates so it doesn't really seem like they want me to join. However, we were in a group setting so it didn't seem like the right time to bring anything up. 

This isn't really about the vacation or the flights but I do feel excluded. However, they also excluded my brother so it could be possible they just want a vacation for just their smaller family.

So I live in a different part of the country than my family.  They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I’d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. 

I was chilling at my parents’ house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  

This family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn’t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.

Nope.  The next few hours I get messages like 

“Really.  REALLY?!  You can’t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?”

“She has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.”

When I didn’t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like “I can’t believe how selfish people are.”  “I have to call in to work because some people can’t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don’t get fired.” “Wow.  Just wow.” “You’d think family would be there for you.”  “Must be nice not to have any responsibilities.”  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  

It was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of “must be nice” type comments.  And I haven’t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond “yeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.”  I’m pretty sure they think I’m selfish anyway so I guess what’s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don’t see my family often and I don’t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody’s brought it up to me.

0,"AITA if I don't let my sister move in? | So, kinda a long one.

I am 26. I am the youngest in a big family. One of my oldest sisters is 48.

I have a good job (and am currently going through a year of training for a massive promotion - this is a pretty stressful time career wise and financially because it means I'm unable to do overtime or earn any extras for this entire period, overtime being something I usually do a lot of), I own my house, I have an amazing other half and we have a dog who means the world to us. 

My older sister quit her job a few years ago because it was stressing her out - she had no back up plan. A little while after that she decided to move 200 miles away from her (retired) husband and do a course at university for a year, she completed the course but never used the qualification for anything. She remained unemployed for a couple of years then met someone else (who is married and lives on another continent), left her husband, moved 500 miles away and eventually got a job which enabled her to sometimes work from home. She stores everything she owns in my 'box room' as there's no where else for it to go.

She maintained this for about 5 months before quitting her job to travel. A week before she quit she said to me 'I'll be with you from 22 December, does that suit you?' - to clarify, in the past I had said the words 'I'll always be here for you' and 'if there's anything I can do to help' to her but I'm not sure that covers all of this. When she mentioned December, I assumed she meant for Christmas and went along with it.

When she arrived she had everything she owned other than what was already in my house with her. I didn't know she wasn't going back to her place or her work. She stayed until the end of January when she went off to travel. When she's here she's sloppy and doesn't give me any money but uses the WiFi all day every day to call her boyfriend and does the laundry in a way that I hate, she never ever walks the dog or even let's her outside (we pay £50 a week to have someone else come walk her), never uses the dishwasher, leaves things lying around and of course is at this point taking up two full rooms in my house. Some days I don't even see her, she's just upstairs on the phone constantly. She's very very sensitive so it's impossible to have a conversation about any of this. One time I asked her not to leave dishes in the sink, rather put them on the side, and it was like telling someone they've only got a week to live. Even though she's away now, I can't have anyone stay over because her stuff is taking up the whole guest room and another whole room in the house. 

Anyways she's away on holiday now and just text me that she broke up with her boyfriend. She had future plans to go travel to see him, but now they're cancelled.
She asked me about coming back here but the thought makes me want to scoop my eyes out - however, she has no where else to go.

I argued that since I paid for the packet of Skittles, I have at least 50%, if not more, right to the Xbox. If I hadn't bought the Skittles, it would be impossible for her to enter the draw and hence no winnings. We argued for a bit and then she got angry at me and said I was being TA.

We organised a date for it to be next weekend but yesterday morning she messaged us and said that she still needs to buy the game and needs to buy it tonight in order for it to be here as it takes 5 business days shipping.

She just chanced her arm that we would gift her a saving.

I feel like she’s put us in quite an awkward position, I think it’s quite entitled, selfish and greedy of her. Yeah she said voluntary but it puts pressure on everyone to cough up. I then would feel that I would be expected to bow out as it would be awkward to play with the others knowing that they’d contributed and I hadn’t.

She sent me a picture of the invitation from our cousin a week away from the shower date. 

A little more backstory, I have been prepping and planning for a podcast that me and my co-hosts have started recording in January. For the first two months of the year we set a schedule back in November to record every Saturday, the only day of the week that we can all do it, to start recording a backlog before releasing. 

The date is on the next Saturday, during the hours that we record. On top of it my wife is working that day and traveling is not easy for me because of my disability. The Shower is almost 3 hours away from me, but that is beside the point. I am already commited to something else that I have told my family and her that is my schedule, but I feel ignored all the time when I tell them what is going on in my life.

So I tell her that information, totally honest with her on what I'm doing and no response. I try to call her later in the day, no response and never get anything back.

I go out of my way to give them a call or send a text message to see how things are and I barely get an answer much less a conversation most of the time. I have even explained to them that I'm tired of being the only one to contact them. My Dad doesn't even contact me anymore because I refused to lend him money 5 years ago.

In the 80s, my mum married her first husband and had my sister (we'll call her H), who is now 32. They divorced in the early 90s because he was unfaithful and she met my dad and had me in '96. My dad died shortly after I was born and in the mid 00s, she reconnected with her first husband and they got remarried.

H and I have never really gotten along. She was always very jealous of me because she didn't like sharing  Mum's attention and we had very little in common because of the big age gap. She was also just pretty mean to me throughout our youth. I chalk most of it up to the fact that, in the eyes of her dad she can do no wrong and she's basically spoiled rotten by him. Mum didn't like to argue with my stepdad too much so ultimately H always ended up getting her way. An example of her behaviour: when I came out, our mum threw a little party for me. H didn't like that she wasn't centre of attention and threw a huge tantrum because our mother told her she wasn't allowed to cut the cake. She was 27 at this time. 

H is getting married in a couple weeks time. Expectedly, she's been something of a Bridezilla this entire time. It's gotten progressively worse since the wedding planning has started. It reached a peak last week, when she essentially told our mother that she wouldn't be allowed to be in any of the wedding pictures unless she dyed her hair (she recently had highlights put in it and a family friend made a comment about how nice she looks and how she and H could be mistaken for sisters), and also essentially told me that my partner isn't welcome at all because he has tattoos that are visible when wearing a suit (on his hands and neck) and she thinks it looks ""common"" and ""uncouth"". This wouldn't be an issue at all except her maid of honour *also* has neck tattoos and she has no issue with that. Mum was really upset by this, and I was annoyed by what I perceive to be a targeted jab at my boyfriend. I kinda blew up at her and called her a spoiled brat and a Bridezilla, and told her that I didn't want to go to her wedding anyway. 

She burst into tears and ran out of the room. Naturally, her father took her side and told me what an absolutely rotten person I am and demanded I apologise to her. I refused and he's been hounding me on it ever since. As mum doesn't like conflict, she's told me to just apologise to put an end to things but I don't think I should.

Over the past few months, every time we have done a bank run there has been one particular teller who has been unneccessarily rude to me and also the other staff, even going so far as making one girl cry.

0,"WIBTA for potentially kicking my SIL out of our wedding? | Disclaimer: this is written by the fiancée of this person’s account. I don’t have my own account, but I could use advice. I am on mobile, so I apologize for formatting.
 
I’ll try to make this as simple as possible. I (25F) am getting married to my wonderful fiancé (26M). We are having a big wedding. I’m so excited, because he is the love of my life.
But there is one pretty big issue. My fiancé has an older sister (Mia, 27F) who dated our best friend (Tom, 25M) about 2 years ago. Tom, my fiancé and I are all best friends. We have known each other since college. Of course, they had a  horrible breakup. After a year of dating, they had moved in together, then one day Mia took all of her stuff and moved out without talking to Tom about it. I have always found Mia to be dramatic, immature, and she ALWAYS plays a victim card. Unfortunately, my future in-laws cater to her left and right.

So, horrible breakup ensues. Tom shows me their texts back and forth, and to be honest they are both terrible to each other. Name calling, harsh accusations. Mia immediately starts posting pictures with another guy (who she started dating literally a month later.) Of course, playing the victim, Mia tells my fiancé’s parents that Tom verbally/emotionally abused her. She made these insane claims that I KNOW are false but character limit. Fast forward, she is in a relationship, Tom is not (but is doing okay), but fiancé and I still cannot even MENTION tom’s name around Mia or her parents. So when it came to our wedding, I had to choose between Tom and Mia in our bridal shower. Finances parents tell me that if Tom is a groomsman, Mia won’t be a bridesmaid. I (regretfully) agree with it to keep the peace in the family. Tom is understanding, just a little upset.
 
So here’s where I am wondering if I’m TA. Tom is still coming to the wedding. If Mia is even near Tom, she cries and puts a bunch of attention on her. At my grandma’s funeral, she cried because Tom was there to support my family and I. Ridiculous. So I have made the decision that if Mia causes a scene and cries and takes the attention away from our celebration, then I will pull her aside and ask her to leave. When fiancé’s brother found out, he freaked out at me and called me an asshole. And maybe it seems extreme, but Mia will have her boyfriend (then prob. Fiancé) there, her whole entire family there (who all hates Tom because of the exaggerations and lies) and I just will not be able to stand it if she causes something at our wedding. Trust me, she has cried and made everything about her in the past (i.e. the day we got engaged).
 
So I guess what I’m asking is, would I be the asshole if I wouldn’t put up with her bullshit on our wedding day? We have compromised enough for her, short of disinviting Tom from our wedding, which we refuse to do.

Needless to say, I was excited and when my sister mentioned she wanted one for my niece for her birthday, I told her I would try. At the store I was told they had no extra and the store closest was about an hour away. So I asked if they had a new switch and they told me that only had used. So,  I got her a used one,  accessories and a case and went home. 

I brought the gifts over to their house that night and my niece, a 16 year old girl looked visibly upset at seeing that it was just a plain console. She said thanks and that was it.  

Next day I post online a picture of my new console with a Tom plush and didn't think about the fact her mom off and on will be on my friends list. To make it short,  my sister screamed at me that I'm a grown man who doesn't need it and her daughter is now 'sobbing'. She stopped and dropped the stuff at my house saying she doesn't want it, so I waited a day and then gave it to my friends son who loves it.

1,"AITA for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid? | My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. 

So here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. 

Between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ""ok sure."" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. 

I want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

When I went in, I was the only one in the room. The lady sat me down and sat back down on a chair and started watching TV.

She looked really antsy and nervous for whatever reason, and then she got up and said ""all right, I'm going to cut your hair""

I  tell her what I want, how short, I even showed her a picture as reference and she says ""I'll try my best"". Honestly, I should have realized that it wasn't going to be a good haircut after she said that, but it went over my head.

The whole time she was cutting, she was trembling and sweating the whole time. She totally disregarded what I asked for and it looked like absolute shit. When I say it was shit, I mean it was absolute dog shit. She basically gave me a mohawk and there were tufts of longer hair around my ears.

I didn't say anything, I just kinda stared in awe, I'm pretty sure she knew I wasn't happy with the cut because she said ""I didn't know what you were asking"" and ""sorry, it's my first time w/ a male client. This is my aunt's shop and she's been training me to cut hair""

I asked her where her aunt was and she told me that she went on an errand. I also asked her why she wouldn't tell me that it was her first time cutting a dude's hair, isn't that something you should mention before cutting someone's fucking hair.

I was really mad because the haircut was $25, which is way too much for a guys haircut if you ask me.

I handed her a 10 and a 20 and I waited for my change, but then I see her stick the remaining change into the tip jar.

I said ""really?"" and I took my change out of the jar and left.

0,"AITA for asking my mom for money she owed me in the past? | Background: Back in 2018 I loaned my parents $1,500 (which I very much needed) for a payment for a family vacation. The trip was to Orlando, FL for my sister’s gymnastics tournament (we live in NY), which I really didn’t even want to go on. However my brother is autistic and my mom REFUSED to go without him, and leave him home with me (21 at the time) and my dad. My dad and I were pretty insulted by that, because we’ve always taken good care of my brother and it would have been a lot cheaper just to send my mom and 2 sisters, but whatever. 

My mom is very ADD and cannot really focus on one thing at a time, so I had to go in order to make sure that my mom could go to the gymnastics meets while I take my brother and other sister to the Disney world parks. 

At the time, my dad was short on money, and I had just sold one of my saxophones, and made $1,500 which my dad asked to borrow the day I got it. We had never really struggled financially, so I had no problem loaning it to my dad, since he was the one paying for it. They promised it would be payed back within a few months, which I had no problem with. My mom was in charge of paying me back. Money came back slowly, but I was getting it at an ok rate so I had no problem. 

Fast forward to about 4 months later when they only owe me about $150. At that time I got a red light camera ticket that was $50. I told my mom, if you just pay the ticket for me, we can call it even. I figured a $100 loss wasn’t too much to be upset about, plus I hate paying tickets online. I assumed all had been done until today. 

I got a speeding ticket in the mail (going 43 in a 30 I know, huge crime) for $50 and went online to pay it. I search up my license plate and saw that I had 2 fines that needed to be paid. Turns out my mom had never actually paid the ticket that I got and now the fine has gone up to over $100. I asked my mom why she never paid and she got all defensive, and then yelled at me when I asked her for the money for it. Am I the asshole for asking for the money?

0,"AITA for refusing to claim my grandma? | Some backstory: My grandmother and I have never had a very good relationship. My cousins and I have a running ""joke"" that grandma loves you... Until you turn 13. Then she absolutely hates you until you prove yourself. My oldest cousin got married to a wonderful guy. My middle cousin gave grandma her first great grandbaby. When I started going to college, grandma started liking me again, but that seemed to end quickly when she found out I medically withdrew.

Because I never ""earned grandma's love,"" she's always been really petty and nasty towards me, especially around the holidays. Most notable is the Christmas my brother was born. My parents were still in the hospital on Christmas Eve, so I was alone with my grandparents. My grandmother screamed at me that I was an ungrateful child, my parents give me everything and I squander it, and I'm horribly disrespectful and don't deserve what they give me. I didn't tell my parents for years. It got worse, but I always took it because my brother loved having the family together for Christmas.

Three Christmases ago, grandma started acting nasty towards my little brother. Even to the point that she made him cry on his birthday because she accidentally caused him to spill his milkshake but ended up screaming at him that he was acting ridiculous and that it was all his fault and he didn't deserve the milkshake in the first place. That's when my hatred really began to fester.

Two Christmases ago, I was late to Christmas because of work. Before I got there, my grandma kept needling my dad over petty shit and my dad got mad, which turned into an argument that he ended with, ""This is my house and you need to respect that.""

I show up early Christmas morning to find my parents standing in the kitchen. Grandma left in the middle of the night to check into a hotel and left a note to my little brother blaming my dad for acting immature and attacking her.

Grandpa was gone to check on her. He comes back and goes to talk to my parents privately. My mom tells me that grandpa was sent to tell my dad that she refuses to come back for Christmas unless he apologizes for unjustifiably attacking her and acknowledges that he's ruining Christmas. If dad refused, then grandpa was to pack up their things and leave. My grandma also demanded my grandpa take my uncle's ashes from off our mantel because we ""don't deserve to have him in \[our\] house anymore."" (I was very close to my uncle before he passed.)

Since then, grandma keeps sending gifts to my little brother, saying she is innocent and it's all my dad's fault. My parents haven't let him see any of it (too hard to explain). Grandma has made no attempt to contact to me.

My oldest cousin told me that I'm overreacting and I ""just need to get over it."" My friends have looked at me shocked when I say that it would be easier if she was dead, because that's a better explanation than what's gone on.

0,"Aita for asking my girlfriend to pay me for something her friend damaged | I’m in college. Last week was my birthday and I had about 15 of my friends at my family’s vacation house to party last weekend. My girlfriend who goes to another college came and she brought 3 friends. It was a total of 5 extra people. It was my gf, 3 of her girlfriends and a boyfriend of one of the girls. I am pretty welcoming and since they were friends with my gf I didn’t mind. It was a bunch of fun playing drinking games all night and what not. The next morning people started leaving, my gf said One of her friends had work that day, so they left pretty early. 

As I was doing some cleanup, I noticed there was vomit all over the bed in one of the bedrooms. Bed, floor, sheets, pillows, comforter, you name it. I tried washing everything, but it would not come out to where my parents wouldn’t notice. So I was like okay great, let me find out who this was and they will have to pay for all new bedding. It’s a queen bed with expensive sheets. Idk why my mom wants expensive sheets at our vacation house but she does. 

I end up finding out that the person I knew the least was the culprit. My girlfriend’s friend’s boyfriend. I didn’t really know him at all, so I texted my girlfriend explaining the situation and said I’d need to get in contact with him over the bill. She said she would “let me know”, which I found strange. Also found it rude that they just left in the morning without saying anything, but whatever. 

My girlfriend got back to me saying that this dude basically said he was sorry, embarrassed , thanked me for the hospitality and letting him come. However, he is in his own money troubles, and he doesn’t really know me or know when we’d be seeing eachother, so he does not feel like he should be responsible for replacing the bedding. 

I am not a very dramatic man and I don’t like to fight. So I simply told my girlfriend “ okay, if that is how he feels, you and his girlfriend can either pay me yourselves, or talk to him and get him to pay” 

My girlfriend was offended that I was “blaming” her. And that she wasn’t involved and doesn’t know why I’m asking her of all people to pay me. I told her that she invited these friends, who I don’t really know but I’m a nice guy so I let her, to my house. One of her invites ruined something, I didn’t ruin it, my parents didn’t ruin it, nobody else at the party did. So why should anyone else other than who is responsible have to pay? 

She called me a dick and told me how she could t believe I would ask this kid or her for money when they are broke college kids and my parents easily have the money to replace it. I said it’s not their or my responsibility since we didn’t do it. I told her to talk to me when She lets me know how I’m going to be paid. 

The boyfriend actually texted me a few days later apologizing and saying he pays his own rent and buys all his own food so he really doesn’t have the money. And that all the girls feel really bad too. I left him on read.

0,"AITA for talking at school about my dad's affair and my parents divorce? | 
So my parents are divorced, they divorced because my dad cheated on my mom with one of my classmates moms, who is married. I'll call my classmate Jen.

So my parents were super involved in stuff locally. Homeowners association, parents teachers organization, all sorts of local civic shit, everyone knew them and thought well of them which sucked because behind closed doors things were a mess. My mom can be angry, nothing compared to my dad though, and he had a drinking problem too. Of course it was forbidden to talk about stuff at home so everyone had this picture perfect idea of a suburban family... 

Then my dad screwed Jen's mom and got her pregnant... My parents got divorced, Jen's parents are somehow still together.

And in all this mess, I started to let stuff slip at school, like to say that my parents were getting a divorce, that things weren't as happy as they looked. Just to my friends, and just quietly.

But then, it was like the floodgates opened. I realized it felt really fucking good to be open about what's going on, trust my friends with the truth, not cover anyone's dirty secrets. So I just started opening up. 

My teacher would ask why I'm late, I'd say that my dad started drinking at 7 am and I wouldn't get in the car with him drunk so I walked

My coach would ask me why I wasn't going to a competition and I'd say we didn't have the money because my parents are blowing it all on divorce lawyers because they can't settle shit themselves. So no activities for me for a while.

My classmates would as me if it was true my dad had knocked up Jen's mom and I'd say yeah. 

I'd always felt like there was something dirty and wrong about talking about bad stuff going on behind close doors at home but honestly it's not my dirt to hide. i don't feel ashamed or upset lying to my friends anymore. I met with my school counselor who's teaching me about resources for stuff

I feel generally pretty great, but there is a little pressure on me to be less honest.

People my dad knows because of his involvement in the town know he's cheated and a drunk and all that, and he's real mad

My mom is alright with everything but she's got a lot else on her plate so I think gossip doesn't really make a blip on her radar.

Jen's mad at me for being ""white trash"" and messing things up in her family... Apparently her mom is really upset the personal stuff she's got going on is public now. Jen thinks I'm so trashy for not... IDK, covering it up?

I think there's a lot of drama going on between my dad and Jen's mom, they're fighting like all hell about the child

Anyway, I told my dad that if he doesn't want the word to get out, don't expose me to your bad decisions and messiness and I won't have shit to say. I don't want to have to hear or see this shit myself

She received lots of replies with people offering to send her formula, letting her know what companies send free formula samples, offering suggestions like food stamps etc.

I commented, ""Have you considered switching to breastfeeding instead of formula?"" (thinking maybe formula feeding was just a preference). I received lots of backlash about how ""obviously"" there's a reason she isn't breastfeeding and that the question is ""ridiculous"" and there's ""clearly a reason she’s using formula"" and she doesn't need to ""defend her feeding decision."" One of the moderators asked if I'd be less of a bitch if they gave me breastmilk...

I went on to comment about how everyone else is allowed to offer suggestions, but apparently, I’m not because it’s about breastfeeding? I said maybe we should go tell everyone mentioning food stamps that it's a ""ridiculous"" suggestion and there’s ""clearly a reason"" she’s not on food stamps.

I believe moms have every right to choose how to feed their babies & if they want to feed formula for no other reason than they just don't feel like breastfeeding, that's 100% their choice. However, if you can't afford to pay for formula to feed your child, then maybe you have to give up those preferences. I figured ""fed is best"" can go both ways.

So I have this neighbor that does things that I find mildly annoying on a fairly regular basis. Their trash cans tip over two or three times a month and spill into my yard, their adult son smokes weed and the smell occasionally drifts into my house, and they park their van on the street so that it is mostly in front of my house. I never say anything to him about these things because they usually do a pretty good job of picking up the trash when it spills, weed is legal here, and I don’t own the street. Plus none of it bothers me enough to bring it up. 

My wife and I park both of our vehicles in the garage, however earlier this week we bought her a new car and we will be selling her old car by ourselves. I pulled the old car onto the street and parked at the very edge of my property line so that it is entirely in front of my house and there is enough room for one more car between it and my driveway. I know that will prevent my neighbor from parking where he usually does, but I figure it’s not a big deal because he has his garage, his driveway, and enough room to park two cars along the street on the other side of his driveway, so the man has other options. 

After only three days of our old car being parked there I come home and his van is backed up to within a couple inches of our old car and is partially blocking his driveway, he approaches me and asks if I will move the car so he could park where he normally does. I told him I wanted to leave space for our guests to park in front of our house and that the car would be gone soon since we are selling it.   He then points to where he wants me to move the car so that his will fit again, I point out that if I do so there will not be room for another car in front of our house, in addition to occasional other visitors my wife’s parents are over once or twice a week and it makes sense for them to park in front of my house. 

I asked him if there was some reason he couldn’t park on the other side of his driveway and he said he likes to park on my side because it’s easier ( I can’t see any reason that this is the case). As politely as I could I explained that the street is first come first serve and that if the space was open I would be parking the car there until it sold, and that if he found it open to help himself, however I would not be moving it just so that he could take its place. He seemed upset and scoffed at me before going back into his house. Am I the asshole for not just moving the car?

TLDR:
Neighbor usually parks with 3/4 of his car in front of my house.

I'm 16M BTW. 


So in my religion people celebrate eid on which elders give kids money to buy whatever they want. Similarly I also got eidi (eid money) to get whatever I want. So I collected eidi from every relatives and thanked them kindly and stored it. Its about 500$ usd.

So in my country in that much money you can easily get a good PC for high end games and basic editing or animation stuff. So I told my parents I am storing my money in my cupboard (I told them exactly where and no one else) and what I will do with it.

Then we went into hard times financially but not that hard that we would need to leave home or won't have food. Like one of those times that if you budget you could easily survive with all the bills paid but my parents like to get takeaway or dineout often which is extremely expensive in my country. (like really expensive).

So my parents asked me for some of my money and I asked what got and they said for usual bills. So I initially was willing to give them money but when I asked for details they became dismissive and I decided to not allow them to take my money.

So the time comes for me to go buy a PC. I open my cupboard and count my money. There is a 100$ missing. I immediately go to my parents and ask them who took it because only they have the key to my cupboard except me. At first they hesitate but then say things were financially hard so they took my money.

I asked them again for details but they ignored me and pretended I wasn't even talking. My mom said she will return me my money in 2 weeks. I was OK with that. 6 weeks go by and my dad just got off the phone with a local shop that sells mobiles.

Well I asked him why would he need to talk to a mobile phone guy considering he just got a phone upgrade. He then tells me he is getting my mom a new mobile. Initially I was happy but then I remembered that my mom said she would give me my money so I ask him about it.

He then pretended I didn't exist which made me mad and I went to my mom and asked her about my money. She said they don't have any money they are still struggling financially. I tell her about how my dad   is going to buy a new phone which costs around 100$.

She immediately goes to the kitchen to make food and when I ask her again she pretends I don't ask and like I am invisible.

So later I see dad put the 100$ in a cupboard. I warn my dad that I will take that money if he doesn't atleast tell me he wi return my money.

He again pretends I don't exist and puts the money.
That same night I went and took the money and hid all of my money in a secret drawer i built myself that no one knows about.

My MIL is generally very lazy and unorganized, and does the bare minimum, no matter what the situation. This is important. 

Few months ago, a cousin of hers was in town for one evening, and was staying at my ILs. This is a cousin MIL hasn't seen in 15 years, and MIL invited my husband and I to meet the cousin and her nephew while they were visiting.  My husband and I ended up going there for lunch so we could help my ILs set up the house, etc. As usual, MIL had done the bare minimum. I asked her if we should finish making dinner so we'd be free to host them, and she said we'd figure it out later. I'm a project manager by profession so I like to be organized. And in general I'm well prepared to host parties and cook a giant feast for people, so it was a bit unsettling for me, but I left it at that. 

Few hours later the cousin and her son arrived, and had to step out to buy a few things for their onward journey, and my husband offered to drive them as they weren't familiar with our town. MIL decided to tag along with them, and they were gone for a few hours, way past dinner time.

0,"AITA because I refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she’s very sick? I low key hate her. | I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. 

She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.

Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. 

Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. 

My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.

1,"WIBTA if I told my (43f) friend (50f) she employs a convicted felon (43m)? |  I've been sitting on this for a couple of weeks now and I'm really torn on what the right thing to do is.

The felon is my ex, Mark. Mark works as a sous chef at my friend’s restaurant.

I dated Mark for a couple years, starting when we were 15, we were each others firsts and he ghosted me when I told him I was pregnant with our daughter (27). The last I heard of him was when his mom told me he was in prison; this was around 20 years ago. Fast forward to now, I've been married for the last 12 years, have a 11f and 8m, I have a well-paying job that I love and my daughter is engaged to a wonderful young man. Neither my husband or I have any family around anymore so we are still really close to Mark's family.

So my friend took a day off from work and wanted to try out her own restaurant, she invited me and a couple other of our friends along. We had a great time at the restaurant and when service had calmed down a little the sous chef (Mark) personally came out to take our dessert orders. He looked pretty much the same, except for a beard and a buzzed head.

What rubbed me the wrong way was that he introduced himself with a different name. I think he may be impersonating someone else. I've only told my husband about the incident, who thinks that I should stay out of it. I acknowledge that it can be difficult for someone with a record to make a living, but I feel that he is being dishonest and my friend is being conned.

0,"WIBTA if I don't buy my mom a car and a house? | I am currently in my first year of college and am studying to become a geneticist. I am doing this because I feel genuinely passionate about genetics and genetic counseling, and don't care about the money aspect of it. That said, the median salary is about $85k and can be as high as ~$100k. 

I am a first generation college student. My family has always fluctuated between poor and middle class because my mom (46) is a secretary and my dad (47) is a painter. My dad makes a majority of the money and has supported us during the numerous times (10+ years worth) my mom has been unemployed. They aren't ambitious at all, yet often complain about not having money and are bitter when people they know come into money. They live beyond their means with nice cars and things for the house and going out to eat, so they have quite a bit of debt. 

All my mom ever talks about in relation to me going to college is how I'm going to make money so I can 'take care of them'. She says I'm going to buy them cars, a huge house, and send them on lavish vacations every year or more. Today she even showed me a picture of a Dodge SRT Hellcat and said ""this is the car you're going to buy me."" She never expresses pride or interest in my major or my grades, only desire for what will come of it.

The only thing that I believe my parents are entitled to is the $15k Parent Plus Loan that my dad took out for me because I was unable to take out the loan myself. I don't intend to ask them for more and I already have plans to repay them (including interest). But she seems to think I owe them much more, and when I ask her reasonings are usually involving the fact that she provided me with food and shelter growing up.

I’ve blatantly told her that I’m not going to buy her all the things she demands and she got upset. She started asking things like, “What, you think I don’t deserve to have a good life?” and talks about how she supported me growing up. But she never let me do fun things, sports, clubs, or generally do/have anything involving money. She did the bare minimum. 

Plus, she hasn’t even supported me in college; she had initially agreed to give me $30 a week for food but stopped that only a few months in. And then when I got a refund check that was supposed to go towards college expenses she said she wanted to hold on to it for safekeeping but spent it all and lied when I asked her about it. 

She’s a classic narcissist and usually I’m able to separate her delusions from what makes sense, but in this case I’m unsure. I don’t know if I’m being ungrateful or stingy or just frustrated because of the issues we’ve had with finances in the past.

My dad was cremated, and she has kept his ashes hidden somewhere in her room since then, in the white box the funeral home gave him to us in. She held a very small service, and no obituary. Here’s where everything comes into play, my mom is very orthodox Catholic, and is aware that having someone’s ashes in your home is forbidden, so she wants to bury his ashes somewhere with a tombstone that has no name on it.

I have some good cooking equipment that reflects that fact. My husband decided that he was going to start cooking as well, which I was all for. But he started cooking in the kitchen and damaging my equipment. A non-comprehensive list:

* He cooks with my all-clad skillets with the heat up high for fifteen minutes, and then “washes” them by bringing them over to the sink and dousing them with cold water. He says he “likes the sizzle.” At least one of the skillets is warping a bit, it won’t sit straight on the stove anymore and doesn’t cook evenly.
* He uses my chef’s knife to scrape crud off the counter. I told him to use my razor blade scraper to do it, he said “well, that would be overkill.”
* I have a small toaster oven that acts as a mini-oven, I absolutely love. He butters toast BEFORE putting it in the oven. The fat drips onto the element. He did this so much that I’ve already had to have the element replaced once. He continues to do it and says “we can just replace it again.”
* He cooked a tomato sauce in my seasoned cast iron skillet and then ran it through the dishwasher.
* He leaves lemon juice, tomato, vinegar spills all over the granite countertops. When I tell him to clean up immediately, he laughs and says, “it’s granite, it’s indestructible!”

This all annoyed me so much. I’m annoyed just typing it. Finally I told him that unless he starts actually respecting my equipment, I’m going to put it all under lock and key. He said, “what, you’re banishing me from the kitchen?

My (basically)uncle is very well off. I'd need a map to accurately describe his relation, but just know he's kin but not intimidate. He owns a business with about 50 employees. I used to work there. It's grueling work. You work 10 hour shifts, and you're walking, stepping on steps, and bending over the hole time. It used to start at minimum wage, but now it starts at 10$. The ***CAP*** income for 99% of workers is 13$ an hour. Basically, it's a bullshit job. 

I still talk with a few people there and they say morale has been really low. There's been a major issue with shipments getting delayed, so they're out of a lot of product. This leads to a problem where you work for about 30 minutes getting the product ready, only to find out you don't have enough and need to undo that work, and re-do the work with a replacement. This is very physical work all done on a tight schedule while preforming other time sensitive, also physical duties. This always happens when it starts snowing up north.

At a thanksgiving-adjacent dinner, Basically-uncle was complaining about his employees. Keeping in mind that I'm adding some context to his words and these aren't direct quotes, his complaints are:

1. too many people ""have to"" be fired because they fail a random drug test. 

2. on the rare chance that there's an issue with a machine, most folk opt to sit down after they've gotten as ahead as they can be without making a mess. He's tired of telling them to find a broom or other busy work to do. 

3. People are ""Checking"" their phones, and he ""can see"" people's phones.

I was being quiet for a while but after a man who spends 90% working day sitting at a desk started saying something about people taking a 2 to 3 minute break to get off their feet I just said ""Jesus Christ, dude."" And when he asked what I said ""You're such a gigantic fucking baby."" and ""I mean find a real issue to bitch about."" and ""How can you people listen to this bullshit?"" Voices were raised. 

Without going to far into the fall out, because again brevity, he ended up going home and I was blamed by everyone who bothered to speak up, which was primarily my immediate family.

Since she was little she has been a really bright kid, picking everything up much faster than expected. She could speak in full sentences when others could barely speak at all. When she was 5 her teacher (who has taught for 30+ years) said she's the brightest kid he's ever taught. She has always smashed her targets and always been top of her class. She's doing really well at school. Her teachers all love her and she has lots of friends who she gets along really well with. 

My sister has a son the same age, Tommy. Nice lad who goes to the same school as Anna. They're in the same year but not the same class and they have different friendship groups so don't hang out often. Unfortunately he's not as gifted as Anna. He struggles academically and his grades are often below average. 

The school held assessments recently (not official tests just assessments to see what level everyone is working at). Anna did really well at everything as we expected. Tommy, also, met his targets in his tests too. The targets weren't that high but the targets are personal. Anna got the highest grades across the board. 

Yesterday evening we all went to my sister's place. My parents attended, but they briefly left to do some christmas shopping. Anna and Tommy wanted to go with them which they said yes to. 

When they came back they were both in tears. They were selling giant cuddly toys and they both wanted one. My parents didn't bring too much money and could only buy one and chose Tommy, because they were ''so proud'' that he managed to hit his target grades. Anna spent the return the car journey crying and calling him mean things like dumb and ugly which made him cry too. 

When my parents told me their decision I saw red. So the kid who only just manages to get average grades gets rewarded, and the kid who exceeds all her targets and is the best in her year gets nothing? I was absolutely fuming and had a go at my parents for their bad decision. 

We left early and my husband tried to say that I was overly harsh and that I should consider their point of view. I'm sorry but no. They chose Tommy over Anna even though Anna achieved more.

My thoughts behind the decision: Nowadays there is a pressure to be always available and respond to every text you get instantly. I personally don’t like this and prefer to think about my responses sometimes. When that read receipt pops up the person expects a response shortly. In the past (when my read receipts were on, again not sure how the setting was disabled) I have had people ask me something to the effect of “I saw you read my text at [insert time] but didn’t respond until [insert later time], what’s up with that?” And it’s usually pretty awkward to just say you wanted to think about what to say.

(Just to clarify, we both make good money, and while he's not crazy rich, spending 12K on the ring didn't bankrupt him either.)

I just spent 12K on your ring"" or ""I'm not the one wearing a 12K ring."" I'm tired of it and feel like the ring is a noose around my neck.

0,"AITA. Newly Married, car financial disagreement | 
Before our recent marriage my wife had bought new vehicles so often that she is now currently 14k upside down.  ie. purchasing a 20k car means we have to finance 34k.  A few years ago I made the down payment on her current vehicle, Honda Accord (before marriage as a gift) with the mutual understanding/agreement/negotiation that this vehicle would be the one to pay off over time and own outright and eliminate being upside down.

Well this vehicle was recently rear ended and fully repaired.  No mechanical damage, car runs great, repair was excellent.  

She is insisting that we trade in now before the vehicle loses its trade in value due to the reported accident.  I believe this is a non factor as the plan was to own and pay off this vehicle.  It’s trade in after the terms of the loan wouldn’t be outstanding regardless.  

As a result she wants me to pay off her current upside down value (14k) which non of will apply to down payment and purchase a new vehicle using the reasoning that she needs an suv with a hitch to tow our recently purchased kayaks and also to make it down dirt roads.  I believe these are poor reasons to purchase a new vehicle for another 7 years and that I’m only contributing to paying off bad debt and that she may want to do another trade in in the next 2 years.  

Well sufficed to say she’s super angry with me and believes I don’t love her now, threatened divorce etc, as I have opted out to paying for another vehicle that doesn’t get her ahead, just puts her further behind.

I’m number 4 out of 8 kids in a blended family. Because of this, I’ve never had my own party. Number 7 and number 6 have their birthdays within a 5 day period before mine, and since they go first and they’re younger I don’t even get to pick cake flavor. Last year I opened birthday cards at the kitchen table alone and only my parents and one sibling gave me a gift because the household gets tired of birthdays by the time mine roles around. 

Number 8 has never had that issue as she is the only child who has a birthday in June. Additionally, she has 7 older siblings, is the only member of my household to be blood related in some manner to every single other member, and our parents had her at age 40 so they get exhausted with her antics very quickly. As consequence, she usually ends up getting whatever she wants from someone or another after a tantrum or two.

1,"AITA for giving a presentation at school which basically criticizes most people at the school? | So I (17M) am in a bit of a weird position. I'm not the bullied kid. I mean people tried to bully me once, but it just didn't work. I've always had a fierce confidence, so whenever someone tried to bully me and I bit back, they knew it was going to be too much headache and gave up. 

Nor am I a popular kid. Nor am I considered one of the ''normal'' types who just floats around going unnoticed.

I've always been told by girls that I'm good looking (have sharp jawline and go gym a lot), so looking at me, most people *think* that I'd be one of those popular types, but I just wasn't. I consciously decided *not* to be that stereotype - the fit and athletic jock who is a hit with everyone. I *could* have been that person like my older brother, but I chose not to. 

There's valid criticisms of me too - I'm arrogant, quick to assume and sometimes lack empathy, however I'm self aware and honest about it. 

This brings me to the presentation. In one of my classes, we were tasked with giving an individual presentation on a topic that is important to us - something that is *personal* to us. So of course most people gave topics on a range of issues; ranging from health issues, to societal issues, etc. 

My topic? I used this as a platform to criticize our school. Rather than take aim at the system , I took aim at my school specifically. I didn't name anyone in particular, however I did broadly criticize certain groups. Noone was safe - teachers, jocks, cheerleaders, criticized.

Essentially, my presentation said the following:

- The teachers at the school are lazy and unhelpful. For the most part, they don't pay attention much and seem unbothered in class. 

- Many of the girls, especially those who cheerlead (but also those who do not) are too obsessed with social media. My main point here was shallowness. Both guys and girls are shallow, but our school has a bad reputation for instagram wannabes. I said that perhaps those who cheerlead should focus more on academics, and less on empty validation

- Many of the athletes would benefit from being better role models. They are in a position of great responsibility, and yet our town has had multiple instances of these jocks drunk driving and causing damage. There is a high correlation with our school's jocks and drunk driving incidents

- Many on the debate team and choir should seek help for their mental health. This wasn't an indictment of them, but me standing up for them

The school is a bit clique-y, moreso than other schools I've seen. But **I specifically backed up my presentation with evidence - mainly with statistics and my opinion, backed with some philosophy.**

The teacher was not happy, but he did not get me in trouble. In fact, I was surprised that he said it was really thoughtful. The other students mostly pissed off. Then some girls called me a huge asshole, that I'm insensitive. I may see their point...I do have a tendency of being insensitive, but my teacher did praise me.

1,"Aita for telling my girlfriend i wont spend money on her | Today I (24m) mentioned to my girlfriend (24f) that i was going to buy a new computer for work/school, and a telescope with my tax return/stimulus money. Then I mentioned that I'd put the rest of the money i get into the S&P 500 to start investing. I dont make a lot of money since i'm just out of college and recently moved with my gf to florida since she's working on her doctorate. In the meantime I'm working while i try to get into medical school. Last year, I was unemployed for a while between the time i moved with her and the time i got my new job in a lab here. Ive managed to save up about $2,000 now that i have my new job. Its not a lot, i know, but im still proud of it as a start since rent and bills are much more expensive here in florida than where im from. 

Anyway, after telling my girlfriend my plans for my money, she told me I shouldnt do any of that and should put it in savings. Which, normally id agree with but I NEED a computer for work. The telescope is something that's just a hobby ive been wanting to pick up but could never justify the cost (about 200-300 dollars for an introductory telescope). 

So we got into a fight about it with her telling me I spend too much money. The thing is, I very rarely spend money on myself because I hate parting with it. But when i do, I have to include her in everything i do since she has no hobbies of her own. She also hates the things i like to do, so I end up only spending money on stuff that i think SHE might like doing together. 

Also, the most expensive thing ive bought over the past year were annual passes to Disney World since she hinted at it all the time since we moved here. She's a huge Disney fan so I bought them after i got my new job to thank her for helping me so much when i was unemployed from moving with her. She was ecstatic and extremely appreciative. She's even hinted at wanting them again next year, which was not my plan. Shes also constantly talking about wanting to take trips which I wont do.

 So when she made that comment about my spending habits, I told her that ive worked really hard for the little bit of money that ive saved and that she could kiss my ass the next time I had an opportunity to either spend money on her or save it or myself.

We had a couple of estimates where someone came to our house and went through every room counting and cataloging our stuff so they could make the ""best estimate"". We went with what we thought was a reputable company who provided a non-binding estimate below our employer's max meaning we would pay nothing other than tipping the workers. They implied that the final bill was likely to be less than the estimate, and we got rid of a lot of stuff in between the estimate and move in an attempt to further lower the cost. Throughout the whole packing and moving process, there was no mention of any price increase. Then, about a month after the move, we were invoiced for a price about 50%  more than the original estimate meaning that instead of $0 we would now be paying about $3,000 (we are not exactly wealthy). 

When I disputed it, they said that their estimator made a mistake (the actual weight and packing was way off), but that we needed to pay the extra.

If I try to stand up to her, she gets aggressive, and is not afraid to get somewhat violent. She also blames me for basically everything wrong in her life (mostly because my parents helping me a little bit with college stopped her from going to a specific private K-12 school she wanted to attend). And this isn't to the level of normal sibling fights. No, if I try to ignore her comments, she will literally keep going for HOURS until I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. She manipulates my parents so they can give her what she wants with her doing minimal work, and when I confront her about it, she calls ME the leech because of, again, college (despite all of the things I do to pay for most of it). And she doesn't like my boyfriend much either, always trying to say he's ""fat and lazy,"" which he isn't. This isn't all, but it gives you an idea of how life with her has been like.

Because she makes me miserable, bullies me constantly, and always finds a reason to talk trash about me or embarrass me, I told her and my parents that, at the moment, I can't see myself letting her be my maid of honor one day.

She got MAD, and my parents were also upset, with my dad calling me an asshole for it. But I can't imagine, on such a big day, dealing with that added stress.

We had gotten in an argument this morning but pretty much gotten over it, so I figured this would be a nice way to put it behind us and have a nice night. She said she'd love to so when I got home we both got ready to go out. We were just going out to a casual spot, a brewery actually, nothing fancy. When we were deciding, 

I brought up that maybe we should eat on this side of the river so we didn't have to pay the $4 bridge toll. Normally, it's not a big deal but we're both a little broke right now. But the restaurant she wanted to go to was on the other side of the bridge so we decided to go.

We got to the spot but there was a 25 minute wait, so we decided to go across the street for a cocktail. She offered to pay but I told her not to worry about it because she's even more broke than I am, and she could buy us a drink sometime when she actually had some money. We got the call that our table was ready so we headed over there. Up until this point, we were having a great time. Making jokes and laughing and really getting along. So we get to our table, both order drinks and dinner and have conversation. 

When the waiter comes by to take our plates he asks about dessert and we tell him we need to think about it. We never get dessert when we go out, we typically think it's a waste of money and we usually have some sweets at home. I can tell she's interested in dessert, but I tell her we have ice cream and chocolate at home. She makes it clear that she still wants dessert, and I say something like ""Well if you want dessert, that's all you."" And based on her response, I immediately realized that my point wasn't communicated clearly. So I said, ""Just so we're on the same page, I don't want dessert but if you do, you have to pay for it.""

Immediately things turn. She is taken aback. She goes silent. She's pissed. We sit in silence until the bill comes and we pay. We walk out to the car, start driving home, argue about what happened, and then drive home in silence.

I even showed him a spot in the store that was close by where he could park his wheelchair. He just glared at me and wheeled over to the woman.

0,"AITA for pressing criminal charges on my ex? |  Before I start, I would like to provide you with some perspective on things:

1) I'm from Russia

2) Russian jails are way beyond European standards

It has been a long journey that seems to have finished yesterday. 

I reported to the police that a significant amount of money (around 1 k) from my credit card had been transferred without my consent. Soon it became clear that it was my ex-boyfriend who had committed the theft. He took my phone a few days ago while I was working. He said it was to ""check Instagram"". According to the investigation, at the same time, my bank sent numerous confirmation codes to my phone. They all had been deleted, so I found out about the theft only a day later. I suspected it might have been him, so I told the police. To tell the truth, I thought it would be possible to drop the charges by firming an agreement if I found out it was him. God, I wished so badly it wasn't him. I was desperate to find the truth, but when it happened, it turned out to be devastating. Now I reckon that he's guilty, but, unfortunately, I didn't think twice before reporting. As of today, he is highly likely to spend a few years behind bars. 

We had been dating for more than eight years (I'm 25 now) and broke up two years ago. We managed to remain on good terms, despite the fact he had been cheating on me. I have forgiven him. He had a troubled childhood full of abuse, which seems to have contributed to his constant lies. When we used to be dating, he once stole a hefty sum of money from my house. But he was heavily drunk, so I thought it was a coincidence. After we broke up he found a good job and gave up drinking. We were close. I believed he had gotten better.

Last year he borrowed around 10 k dollars. It was for his safety needs, as he put it. He used to have dangerous friends, and I've seen them, so I trust him in this matter. Also, I got some threats from them. A few months ago I started getting worried that he wouldn't return the money. And then the theft happened.

Being emprisoned is likely to become his death sentence. Firstly, our jails are inhumane. Secondly, he is weak. I don't want to contribute to his death. 

Should I have avoided reporting to the police? Am I the asshole for even mentioning his name to the police? Am I the asshole for feeling guilty? I know he is an asshole, but I can't stop blaming myself. I'm afraid I might crumble. I'm getting paranoid that people around me say that I'm not guilty not to upset me. I hope to get other peoples' opinions. Am I the asshole for everything that has happened?",False,False,4,5,3,4,2,4,Fairness
1,"AITA For falling out with my brother's wife? | Basically this has been going on for a few years now, I haven't spoken to her for some time and my parents said I was probably over reacting and should let it go now . I dated a guy for a year who was my sister in laws best friend. He was super nice at first and then became a leech. He started borrowing hundreds of dollars from me and my niave ass kept loaning it. He eventually owed me over $2000 - honestly, I'd stopped keeping track after a bit because you just don't expect your boyf to take advantage like that. 

It got towards the end of our relationship where I was sending him money for food and he would recieve it and go and sit in a bar with his friends and stop texting me back. I decided to end the relationship due to feeling like this was going to be vicious circle and I had started having feelings for another man who was self sufficient and made time for me. There was no cheating, I ended everything properly and was honest.
He didn't like this and decided this was enough to not pay the money back - said i deserved it. 

He blocked me on everything so I couldn't contact so I asked brothers wife to speak to him please because it isn't fair, i worked hard for my money and he didn't have a job through our entire relationship. She said she didn't want to get involved and got really short with me and said I shouldnt of asked her to contact him and I was putting her in an awkward position.

I said that she was condoning his behaviour and a good friend would called their friends out on their BS and doing so didn't mean getting involved, just reassuring her friend he's pulling a D*** move.  My brother then ended up getting involved and it started a lot of arguments until he finally came back to me and said i was in the wrong for upsetting his wife asking for help and told me it was my own fault for lending money to someone in the hopes of them paying it back.

1,"AITA For ruining my nephew's birthday party after I was mocked and made fun of by my family? | When me (20M) and my brother Steve (28M) were growing up, there was a lot of competition between us and I always felt that my parents/other family paid more attention to him. For example, his HS graduation was a bigger deal with lots of people attending, mine was just a quiet dinner. That was just one thing among many others.

I know it's a bit petty, but I think I do hold some resentment. So Steve graduated from college years ago and it was a big deal since he was the first person to graduate in our family.  I am in college right now and have to take an extra year due to some other issues I am having and I've been frustrated about it.

So my brother has a 3 year old son, and was throwing a big birthday party for him. Throughout the party I was ridiculed, for example, in a conversation with my uncle and aunt, my aunt said about me ""well at least if this one doesn't graduate college, we'll still have Steve to celebrate about."" 

Steve also made a few digs at me, saying in a supposed joking manner ""once you drop out, I'll get you a job to shine my shoes every morning"" and people around me laughed, including my parents. I was ticked me off because I hate being reminded of my failures.

In addition, when there were a few guests that arrived, they ignored me straight up completely and went to Steve even if I was standing right there.

I got so fed up that I walked over to the birthday cake that was sitting on the table in the back and when no one was looking, I punched my fist through the middle of it, then I went back and joined the party.

It turned out to be a mistake since someone did see me and informed my parents. My parents called me outside and scolded me and told me I was being selfish, I told them I was tired of being mocked and how they were also just as bad for not doing anything about it.

I was told to go apologize to Steve and try to make it up to him, and when we went back inside he ran over to me and asked ""what is your fucking problem?""

I told him that I hate being made fun of, but Steve did not express remorse and instead told me to go apologize to his son for ruining the cake, I told him ""you apologize first you fucking dickhead."" His son was only 3 years old, so I figured he wouldn't even remember what happened, and I was mad that Steve refused to acknowledge his bullying.

Steve yelled at me and kicked me out and at this point everyone was looking, I told him to go fuck himself and left. He hasn't talked to me since and supposedly told my parents that he is going to keep his nephew away from me. My parents are also on his side.",False,False,3,4,2,2,1,3,Fairness
1,"AITA for wanting my girlfriend to be less braggy about her work perks? She seems to forget that the way she lives isn't how most people live... | 
My girlfriend has a pretty sweet job. She doesn't have set hours; she just has to work 35 hours a week whenever is convenient for her and make it to her few meetings. She can work from the office or from home sometimes. She has a full benefits package despite being under what most people consider full time. A really nice retirement package too. And the company will pay everything for continued education.

She does work she finds interesting (cutting edge robotics) and gets along well with her coworkers. She has a lot of PTO per year and her boss even lets the employees ""earn up"" more; if they work extra hours one week they can ask for the equivalent in PTO for later.

Her team's managers buy them whatever they want for the office; they want a 500 dollar expresso maker, they get it. They want a type of fancy coffee, they get it. Nice furniture, done... 

They get paid well too; pretty middle of the road salary for robotics but she says the work life balance more than makes up for it. She'd rather have more time than be a top earner. And honestly a midrange robotics salary is still damn good.

And anyway, For a while I thought ""good for her"" for having found something that she is happy with. 

But recently it's gotten frustrating because I think she forgets that this isn't how everyone lives. Like when we're out with my friends or just hanging out she'll talk about the nice stuff her managers bought for the office, about all the vacations she takes, about how she and her coworkers left the office in the middle of the day to see a movie then came back and just worked a little later. 

And yeah, it seems like she forgets that is no way a normal job.

So last night we were at a party and she mentioned how she was going to tour a few new apartments Monday morning and afternoon, and one of the people at the party was like ""don't you have work"" and she said ""yeah but I can set my own hours"" 

And that just rubbed me the wrong way and I said that she needed to stop going on and on about her work perks, it was obnoxious and came off braggy. She was like ""I was just explaining something"" and I said it wasn't just this, it was everything. Most people don't live the life she lives.""

She said that I was coming off jealous and that it was a bad look. That she was where she was because she didn't settle for less; she studied and worked her ass off, and didn't let herself get too settled anywhere she was unfulfilled. And that instead of complaining, maybe I should ask myself what I'm feeling jealous of and what I need to do to get it. 

I told her she was missing the point; she'll always be around people who don't have what she does, and she could be a little more modest about it.

She said I was the only one who seemed to have a problem with it, and stormed off...

1,"AITA for continuing to ask a woman if she would be quieter during a concert when I felt she didn't answer the question with her response | I'm at the city theatre for a concert with a family member. Everyone is sitting down and it ranges from gay men  and a few lesbians to families to a lot of women in their 30’s  at this show.

During the opener, a band which was great, playing some 80’s hits (Hungry Like The Wolf) singing along having a good time, and then the two women behind us start to get loud. Just talking and laughing. And the music for the opener wasn’t really that loud, so they were overpowering the music really. Enough times that the person I was with did the little shoulder glance back so I knew it was bothering them, and I knew it was bothering me, and now I felt justified, it’s bothering the person I’m with.

I actually give it another minute after I decide I’m going to ask them to be quieter because maybe they’re gonna settle. It’s cool to have fun, they’re just a bit too loud. So they continue, and I turn around to face them, and I say and make a point to be as polite as I can (because this is something I’m really working on with frustration) and say “I’m sorry, will you please be quieter?” 

Now this is where I need some feedback to know if I was an asshole. Neither woman looks at me, and I’m directly in front of them, and in their face not as in leaning in, just they have to see me, I’m directly in front, not to the side. The one I’m really talking to, the woman behind me who might be a bit older than me but not a huge amount, says “Sorry.” I want to be clear, this wasn’t a nice sorry. It wasn’t like a genuine “Oh sorry” where she might not have even known she was too loud, and I didn’t want to embarrass her, I would have said no worries at all, have fun, just thanks for being quieter.

But she doesn’t, and it’s a throwaway sorry. And she doesn’t even look at me. I’m really not angry, but I’m not accepting that as an answer, because it’s the kind of treatment where it would be very possible for her to just go back to doing it in a minute. So I say, “You don't have to be sorry, but will you please just be a little quiter?"" I’m sorry” same tone as in she might as well have said fuck off, and no look to me but just above me. ""I really don’t want a sorry, are you gonna be quieter yes or no?” The person I’m with presses my leg so I know reel it in, so after she says “I said I was sorry” I turn around and leave it.

And it’s not a problem again.

Hindsight being 20/20 it would have been better all around to have just turned back after the sorry and if she continued then acted again.

So AITA for pressing it? Reading it back it sounds like it, but it was just a moment of really offering as much as I could to be a polite about it and when it was just a whatever given back to me I wanted it settled.

0,"AITA for cancelling flight and job interview? | So a couple of weeks back I applied for a job that seemed promising. The company was bigger and more well known, and the position would definitely help advance my career.

Part of the job included travelling locally, so a lot of driving. I have my license, and my wife and I share a car. Although if I got this job I'd need to be purchasing my own separate car and insure it.

I got a couple of interviews in, they then told me the salary, which equates to $6,000 more annually than what I'm currently making. If I were to buy a car and insure it, I would be paying more than that. They also don't cover maintenance and repairs. So that's going to drive up my costs. I looked up reviews of the company and many people complained that they don't cover these costs so I don't feel like I'm in a bubble on this. Obviously I could get advances and raises, but I don't want to rely on that.

I was already considering telling them I wasn't interested, but as I was ready to email the hiring manager he emailed me plane tickets to visit their head office for the final interview.

He then replied angrily. Telling me that I wasted their company's time and money. Saying the flight is non-refundable. He didn't call me an a-hole but in a professional manner I felt like he was.

0,"AITA for not looking after my landlord's dog when I always used to? | Landlord has a dog, we love her. We used to look after her a lot as they go on numerous vacations a year. We train her, she’s smart and picks up behaviours well. When she goes home it isn't carried on and when we have her again we work on it (waiting when we put her bowl down etc.), we also clean her water and food bowls as they’re often mouldy.

A few months back I asked if it would be okay for us to get a dog of our own, we look after theirs and they trust us. We live on farmland with lots of space. They said no as a dog may scratch our floor, the wife told me a week later she has not got enough time for her dog, she is trying to get a project off the ground and they worry if we got a dog it would bark, and set their dog off and that would impact her work. They shut the dog in a room of their house which makes her bark more than usual.

Shortly after they approached me when my fiancé wasn’t home, they offered me their dog on a timeshare. I felt they were trying to take advantage of me as we’d expressed a wish for a dog of our own. They wanted us to have their dog when they're away and I walk her for them as then we get “the joy” of having a dog without responsibility. Their dog gets confused when she isn’t staying with us, as they yell at her when she tries to come and see us, we live open plan so when she is outside she is free to approach us. We really wanted a dog of our own and not to share someone else's, mainly as it does confuse her.

I got several messages after asking me at very short notice (an hour before) to have their dog, I had to say no as we weren’t home or were not available. I offered to bring their dog to wherever we were going but they were quite rude in their replies if I said I couldn't. We are now not allowed to pet their dog when she comes to our side of the fence.

They have asked if we would take their dog for a week as they have a lot of work, I declined. We could have her but I feel out of principle they shouldn't just get free dog-care from me when I'm also working at home. I said it would not be any more beneficial for the dog, I suggested I could collect her and take her on an evening walk with me. They recently got chickens and it seems that this has further impacted the level of care for the dog, I thought this would be a good opportunity for them to tend to the chickens uninterrupted. I received a rude response telling me not to bother and basically a “thanks for not helping us”.

Ever since, they’re blanking us. Their dog came to see us today and the wife screamed at her and said “GET AWAY FROM THEM”, I said “oh don’t worry we are happy to say hello!” and the wife muttered under her breath 'only when it suits you'.

1,"AITA for reporting a group of girls in my class for being excludatory to myself and others | I'm a 19 year old college student studying art & design. It's a small class with under 20 students, most of whom are female. There are only 3 guys in the whole class, one of which is myself. Over time the class has naturally divided into 2 separate social groups. One one table there is a group of girls and 2 guys who are quite studious/quiet, they tend to just get on with their work. On the other table there's another all female social group who are very boisterous and chatty. I sit on the edge of this table.

Now, the girls on my table are by all means not awful people. However, being the only guy on the table I have noticed that they treat me significantly differently.

With each other, they're always joking around and having banter, spouting memes and generally goofing off. Whenever I interact with them, they are friendly and polite, but they don't have any banter with me. It's like they think I'm incapable of having fun, when in fact that's my EXACT sense of humor and pretty much how I am with my bros.

Another thing I noticed is that with each other they talk about movies and video games, two things I'm really interested in. Not once have they spoken about those things with me. Usually they will only talk to me about classwork. I also noticed that I seem to cease to exist when they're all present, but if only one of them is in early or something, and I'm the only available option, THEN they'll talk to me.

They very rarely interact with the two guys on the other table either. To me it definitely comes across like they dislike us just because of gender.

I recently started feeling more and more excluded when I would hear the girls on my table talking about stuff in their group chat (which I'm not a member of), and hearing about them hanging out outside of class and having all these inside jokes I can't understand.

So, that brings us to monday of this week. I arranged to have a meeting with our main tutor after class, in which I basically told him everything I've written here. He pretty much said there isn't much he can do in a situation like this because he can't force friendships. He said the only time he can really get involved is if there is actual bullying going on.

I then asked the question ""Is socially isolating somebody to the point where they want to drop out of college considered bullying?""

He said yes it would be, so I said that would mean I am being bullied. My tutor said he would then have a talk with the girls on my table, and I went home feeling better about the situation.

Turns out I shouldn't have felt better because now things are worse. When I came in the next day I was ignored completely. They don't even attempt to talk to me anymore. I also get the impression that they're constantly laughing at me in their group chat.

Until last week, he got rides to and from work every day from one of my friends. I don't know the exact arrangement, but I know that he does favors for him in exchange for the rides, such as helping him build a gaming computer. This coworker that needs rides is a compulsive liar, and therefore I'm not totally certain about certain aspects of his life, but he claims the pick-up truck in his driveway is his and he only doesn't drive himself because it's a lot of money for gas.

Here and there, I have filled in for my friend as the ride to work. He is not terribly out of my way, but I do have to drive the opposite way from work to get him. He and I are not friends, I am doing it as a favor to the one who drives him. He is often drunk on Fridays and is prone to hitting on me on the ride home. He doesn't DO anything wrong, but he does say untoward things that make me uncomfortable.

My friend that is his ride to work had a mental health crisis and quit. He is no longer providing transportation for him, obviously. 

The Friday before last, my boss asked me if I could give him a ride to work. I told him I was willing to give him a ride TO work, but not a ride home. I visit my mother on Friday nights after work because we can't see each other during the week due to our opposing schedules, and I visit my boyfriend out of town on the weekends. We are second shift, so I don't get off work until 11:30 at night. That time with my mom is very precious to me. As petty as it sounds, I am not willing to give even 15 minutes of it to this coworker I'm not close with.

I was assured he would find an alternative ride for him for the ride home. Instead, that night he was waiting for me at my car and told me no one else was willing to do it.

On Monday, I blew a tire and was unable to make it to work. That night, he texted me the following, ""I might not make it to work tomorrow because I'm having trouble finding a ride."" I didn't reply, which I realize is rude, but I don't want to be his daily transportation. Some weeks as crazy as it sounds, I literally do not have a penny of extra gas money. The way I felt was, he didn't ask me for a ride. He hinted around it hoping I would offer, and I just don't want to. I would do it out of pity, but I don't want to offer it.

0,"WIBTA for making my sons play on the same team? | Posting on behalf of myself and my husband.

My husband and I have 2 sons, each from a previous relationship. Both boys are 8 years old. I'll refer to my stepson as ""Jake"" and my biological son as ""Charlie"". My husband and I have been a couple for 6 years now and married 2 years ago. Jake and Charlie have almost always gotten on, but in the time since we moved in together and got married they've been arguing a bit more than normal. We took them to a family therapist who said that boys bicker, so do step siblings, it's up to us to encourage they bond.

Both boys want to play football on a team (just to clarify this is the sport also known as soccer, not American football/rugby). There's a few local teams for boys their age they could play for. My husband and I asked which team they had in mind, as several of their friends play for a team but we weren't sure which. Simultaneously, the boys both say ""Team A"". We say that's great, we'll contact the coach and ask. Later Charlie comes to me and says that he also likes Team B. I ask if he has more friends on that one or something, and he says no, he just doesn't want to play on the same one as Jake. My husband later came to me and said he'd had a similar conversation with Jake, who had also said he doesn't want to play on the same team as Charlie.

So both boys want to play football, both would prefer to play for Team A, but both want to play for a different team to the other. The teams are competitive and play other local teams, so this means there will be at least one occasion in future where they play against each other, and if one of them is on Team A, the other will have to settle for Team B.

My husband and I talked. He feels we should let the boys toss a coin, and use that to determine who is on Team A and who is on Team B. I feel that we should tell both boys they can both play on Team A or not at all. I don't think my husband's idea will end well and he doesn't think mine will, either, so we are turning to an objective audience for arbitration.

1,"AITA Charging a Kid For Driving Her Home From School | My teenage daugher rides bus to school herself in the morning and I pick her up and drive her home in the evening. Earlier this year there is another girl joining the ride.


She is my daughter's junior in school and lives in the neighborhood, about 5 minutes walking distance away from our home. She asked my daugher to ask me to bring her along and she would walk home herself when we reach home. Thinking that it may become a routine, I decided to charge the girl $1 for every ride. She was okay with it.


After a while, I could only pick up the girl 2-3 times a week instead of everyday, because their release time from school are different. My daugher suggest me to stop charging her as we only bring her along under our own convenience, but I said $1 isn't much, more like a gesture of appreciation than payment. She would have paid similar amount riding a bus. I have never forced her to join us, she did it out of her own free will. 


I got a phonecall from that girl's mother a while ago, telling me how greedy and shameful I have been for taking money from a child. She asked me to either take it seriously and pick her up every day or stop charging her money. I told her to discuss that with her daughter and I would still welcome her if she wants a ride, $1 each and only when it's convenient for me.

I know about it because she made the event within a facebook group which I am a part of, so even though I'm not invited, I can see the event title. She does not know I have seen it. 

Here's the problem: she has planned this event at her other friends house (who she has a big crush on) which is on the complete opposite side of the city from where I and all of my friends live. It costs a lot to uber there. Our mutual friend (M28) and my partner (M26) have both expressed to her that if she has the party there, no one will come, or if they do they will leave early and not drink. She refuses to change the location, saying that it's ""not that inconvenient"". The group on facebook she has invited to the event is composed of only her friends, not mine. 

I have asked the mutual friend to tell her that I have been talking about planning my own going away at a brewery close by, and encourage her to change the location to that brewery since that's obviously what I would want. If she still won't budge I am considering revealing to her that I know and telling her that I feel as though she is just using my going away as an excuse to throw a party for herself.

0,"AITA for abandoning my friend and her kids? | I had a friend who was renting a house and was going to need a new roommate soon, as long as I was ok couch surfing for the first month since I just lost my apartment due to money issues after losing my full time job. It was $800 a month for a room in the basement and a private bathroom. That included utilities and internet. Only other stipulation is she would need help feeding her kids (13f & 15m) here and there.

While I worked 2 jobs I wasn’t exactly rolling in dough as both jobs weren’t great. As time goes on I go from feeding her kids sometimes to being the one to feed them and if I didn’t then they may not eat. It got worse to the point where I was working 2 physically demanding jobs on less than 1000 calories worth of food a day. I was literally starving and trying to push what I could to feed the kids. I worked my ass off trying to find a better job and was able to get something finally.

Suddenly the person paying the internet bill decided he wanted to move out with little warning and it fell to me to take care of it. When he came back he never took it back over. So now I am paying close to $900 a month plus a massive food bill. My sister has been asking me if I want to live with her because she knows I’ve been in a bad way and my depression is getting worse since I could no longer afford therapy. April rolls around and it’s time to renew the lease, the roommate who invited me is lamenting she wants to move out but is trying to find someone to take her spot. At this point she has been out of work due to TIA and FM and claims she can’t afford rent anymore. I say let’s sit down and look at the bills and see what’s can be done to balance things out for her and that’s when the other shoe drops.

The whole time she has been paying about $600 a month for three bedrooms (the house has 5 bedrooms), one for her with a private bathroom and 1 each for the kids. She made as much as I did before being on disability so why was I paying $300 more than anyone in the house on top of food costs for two teenagers? Add on the fact that she has Ipsy, other subscription boxes and constantly getting packages from Amazon but can’t feed her own kids even the basics. 

I say nothing but decide since it turns out I was never added to the lease I can go whenever. I talk to my sister and we plan for me to move in at the end of June. Once the date is set I let my roommate know she has a little more than 2 1/2 months to find someone to take over my spot and I needed to get myself on track to getting out on my own again. She is mad I would leave them in the lurch like this even though I gave her so much time find someone else to move in.

Come October she lets me know she and the others were abandoning the house. I know she blames me moving out for the upheaval (they did find someone else to take my room but they weren’t willing to take the extra responsibilities).

At first she was okay with it and was very excited about the discounts I could get her but then when she found out about how much I get paid hourly (I know I probably shouldn’t have told her in the first place), she got really bitter about it. 

I’ve only told a few people about my new job and if she’s around when I do, she will complain about how annoying it is that I’m getting paid the same amount as her when apparently “I don’t even need to use my brain to work and all I gotta do at work is fold clothes”. For context, we’re both students and she works as a cashier/pharmacy assistant. 

A few times when I couldn’t make it to some of our hangouts with our friends for work, she’ll say things like “why don’t you just take the time off? It’s just retail anyway!” Or ask me why I’m taking this job so seriously when it’s not even related to the course I’m studying. 

She also gets weird about the way I spend my money. I really enjoy makeup so I’ll buy myself a few items each month and she’d go around telling people how I have no self-control and that I have a spending issue even when I explained to her that I have a budget on how much I’m allowing myself to spend on my hobbies. 

Now I’ve told before her that the things she said about me or my job are really unfair. She just brushed it off and continues making fun of my job and each time I have an early start (we start as early as 7am) she’s mockingly tell me how she feels bad for me and say things like how she’s so lucky she starts at 9am and don’t have to fold clothes yada yada. I’ve also recently found out from another friend that she told people I’m working so hard to earn money because I’m in a “pathetic” LDR and I have to fly to another country just to see my SO and convinced my friend to not invite me to a trip because I’ll be working or would want to fly to my SO anyway.

0,"AITA for not wanting a new office chair if I can't take my old one home? | Whole office was offered new chairs, I asked about the specs on the new chairs and they seemed pretty basic so I declined because I was one of the lucky few able to nab a really fancy one from a different office when we merged. It's one of the ones with like 10 different nobs and levers to get everything perfect.   


So, they asked me to help assemble all these new chairs (like 20+) when they were delivered and they were telling everyone that if they got a new chair they could take their old one home.  


One of the ladies in our office did not like the new chair once she sat in it so she opted to keep her original chair (it was not a fancy one, just wider). They offered this new chair to any of us that had not switched, nobody wanted it so I sat in it and it was quite comfortable right out of the box and did not need any adjustment. So I took it, it wasn't really any better than my other chair but the fact that I could take the other chair home was enough of a selling point to use the new chair.  


Now, my office mate across the hall (Who has the same fancy chair already and also declined the new chairs) saw me wheeling the fancy chair into the corner of my office & decides they want my fancy chair because the color is different... (hers is more of a beige while mine was black). I told her that was fine, I'll just take the beige one home... I'm sure you see where this is going.  


She says we were allowed to take ""our old chairs home"" and the beige one is her old chair so she will be taking it home herself... So I said nevermind, I'll just keep my chair and someone else can take the new one; she doesn't want it even if she can take the beige one home.

0,"AITA for not aligning with my In-law’s expectations of gender roles and asking my husband to stay home when our sitter calls off? | Backstory: My FIL  and husband are EQUAL business partners of a collision shop. My FIL is the lead when it comes to “back of the house” and my husband is the lead in “front of the house.” They also have two employees working for them, So everything runs real smoothly there and even if someone doesn’t show up, the shop can still run efficiently.

I work as a graphic designer in a VERY small vehicle wrap and sign shop with a total of 3 employees including myself. I get paid well, I get a lot of leniency when it comes to anything at the shop. Basically, I can do what I want as my job is getting done during business hours. I spent years on a degree, which I admit I did not need, however, I am so proud of my work and I love my job. The shop falls behind if I don’t get my tasks completed. 

We had our first/last baby in May 2019. I decided to return PART TIME after maternity leave despite the need for me to come back full time. If I cram an entire weeks worth of work into Monday through Wednesday I still fill the position effectively and I’m still valued. This lets me stay home Thursday and Friday without the worry of childcare. My mother watches our baby otherwise because she asked to. Well, while I really appreciate my mom, she is super flaky, I expected her to be. She’s good for canceling 2-3 times a month on me. So I actually have 2 backup sitters, because if I miss a day of work I set the whole shop back. 

Forward to our recent family debate, argument and eventually my blow-up: TWICE NOW all three of my sitters have been unavailable and it has come down to me or my husband staying home with our kid. My husband wouldn’t mind staying home, he’s not the problem. My FIL straight up looked me in the face and said to me, “you are the woman and the mother, it is your responsibility to stay home if you do not have a sitter.” I’m sorry but I don’t feel this way. I told him as nicely as I could that his son chose to make this baby too and it was also his responsibility. My FIL literally laughed in my face and that’s what pissed me off... I argued with him that we are living in fucking 2020 and that his beliefs on gender roles are fucking stupid. I already (and happily) miss out on two days of work. I need to be reliable for the other three I am scheduled to be there so that I am not replaced. My husband can’t be fired from his own business and it’s not like we lose money if he takes a day off occasionally on the freak occurrence that all 3 sitter options are unavailable. I screamed at him that I was sacrificing a lot for my child but I wasn’t going to give up something I love so much. I called him an asshole as he shook his head and I slammed the door. Nothing like this has ever happened, he’s been very supportive the whole 10 years I’ve been apart of the family but this seems like a no-brainer to me.

I’ve done everything I physically can for this girl and she’s abused it to the point that I’m expected to single handedly work and not question it. I spend hours and hours a day working on things for her and her parents, but in spite of that her family hates me because I’m an ‘asshole’ for questioning what she wants me to do.

Our second year started last month and over the summer, she cracked her phone screen really bad and when she first showed our friend group, she joked about how clumsy she is. Her phone had pieces missing from the screen and when someone recommended that she replace her screen before she hurt her finger, she said that she couldn't afford it yet. 

Last week, I was walking with Kay to grab dinner and I slipped, causing her to also fall and her phone to gain yet another crack.

She started crying and saying that her mom was going to be mad. I went to comfort her and I told her that because I added another crack to her phone, I could give her 50% of the cost right there. She got silent and didn't talk to me at all during dinner. 

Our friends told me the next day that she was mad at me and I mentioned that I offered to pay half for half of the screen so I'm not sure what she's mad about and she should just talk to me about any issues she's having.

After giving me the silent treatment, she finally responded to me (because I was trying to meet her at a local shop for an estimate) and told me she wants me to pay for the entire screen. I think that's absolutely ridiculous because she already had destroyed her phone to the point where pieces had fallen off and was making jokes about it.

I'm also a bit miffed at the silent treatment and the gossip because I immediately offered to pay half although I only added one crack to a sea of 20+.

0,"AITA for getting annoyed at my parents for prying into my financial situation with an offer of help, then backing out when they'd learned everything? |  Backstory: I was a bit of a moron in college, have a lot of student related loans, some of them are very high interest. I have a good job now, but still pay 20% of my salary to debt.

My company has a great PSP, and it allows me to take a loan against it at a much lower interest rate. I recently hit the number needed to pay off the majority of my loans if I borrow against it. In a call, I offhand told my mother I planned to do this.

A week later, my mother called me, and told me that she didn't want me taking that loan because she thought ""The way it works is that they take all interest generated on your retirement fund until you pay back the loan."" I told her I didn't think it worked that way, but she launched into her ""offer"". She told me that she was willing to loan me the money herself, with similar interest rates, on the condition that my parents wanted to work with me to make sure I was budgeting correctly.

I was concerned about this--these sorts of financial issues can lead to lots of rancor, and I've been burned in the past by allowing them to much access and then being nagged about my failings--but in their defense, I had poor financial control and probably deserved it.

Regardless, I agreed to sit down with my mother and go through my budget for the last couple of months to see ""what I could afford"" to pay back every month. We did, I didn't hold anything back, and every time my mother saw something she didn't like she'd get a little testy and go ""That's too much on dumb video games"" or whatever. I said that I knew I wasn't perfect, and what I hoped to get out of this arraignment was someone to keep me accountable and cheerlead for me. I told them I'd make a budget on Google Sheets to track my progress.

She mentioned that ""Well, it's totally possible for you to just hide stuff from us."" I told her that if she didn't trust me to not do that, then she shouldn't offer this sort of thing in the first place. After we went through the debts I had and added them all up, it was about 10% higher than the figure I'd offhand quoted to her in our first conversation.

When I called her next morning, she launched into an immediate tirade about all the things I'd done wrong over the last year, and told me I could ""snowball"" the different loans and it'd all be paid off very quickly. She then told me I had failed at not adding more debt to my situation, and finally finished by saying she wasn't going to loan me any money at all, because the additional money was ""too much"" and they'd rather just not help at all if they couldn't pay everything off at once.

I told her that I wasn't super concerned about her not loaning me any money and she kept talking about all the ways I'd messed up over the last three months. Finally I sort of realized what was going on here, and told her that I thought she'd manipulated me into revealing all my issues with a false promise of trying to ""help me out"" when in reality they just wanted to pry, and hung up.

I thought that was kind of rude of her to say, but I also feel bad that she’s so afraid to be alone in her own apartment. At the same time though, I’m not her babysitter and I don’t like being told I should be home more by a roommate.

0,"AITA for not wanting sleeping beauty in my chair? | A couple months ago I got a very comfortable IKEA chair for my dorm room.

I have a random roommate whom I do not like (he is very annoying, I could make a whole post detailing the shit he does but i digress.) When I first set up the chair in our room I told him that it was totally fine for him to sit in the chair and game but my only rule was don't sleep in the chair (I said this because he has a habit of falling asleep in his uncomfy spinny plastic university given chair.)

&#x200B;

He obliged my request for the first few weeks, eventually though he started to fall asleep in the chair; to which I responded by waking him up and reminding him that I do not want him sleeping in my chair, after which he would make no actions and fall asleep just for me to wake him up again.

&#x200B;

This went on for months, him falling asleep, me waking him up, him falling asleep 5 mins later, me waking him up again cont. until a few weeks ago I finally snapped and told him how infuriating it is to set clear boundaries only for them to not only be repeatedly crossed but straight up ignored when I reminded him.

&#x200B;

This helped until today when I found him sleeping in my chair YET AGAIN. So I let the door slam behind me to wake him up (its on a loose hinge) said hello, and told him that I really do not want to have to talk to him again about sleeping in my chair.

She wanted to know if a character is **dead** at a point in the series which she has already seen.  
I fought it was kind of a weird question but I looked at the Wikipedia page of the Series and of this specific character anyway and found out that later in the series it is going to be revealed that the character wasn't actually dead and what my friends has seen is supposed to be a fake death.

At this point I wasn't sure what to do as she wrote that she didn't want to know any spoilers.  
I told her that the character was truly dead, as I wanted to go the safe route and didn't want to give away any plot twist later in the series.

She accepted it and about 30min later she calls me a ""dumb liar"" after searching online for herself as she wanted to know if the character was **truly dead** or not. She wanted to know the twist.

In my opinion ""Tell me something about the series."" and ""Please do not give away spoilers"" are polar opposites of each other and basically left me in a lose-lose-situation.

0,"AITA for being mad my coworker went to HR on my behalf? | 
I'm a woman in an office that's mostly men, and me and the other women have a lunch out once every few weeks. It's generally good, we help each other out with stuff, hang out and shoot the shit, etc.

One of the women, Julia, has a kind of abrasive personality, kind of judgemental and very quick to focus on bad things rather than good. But I haven't said anything about it so far because I think she's well meaning. 

Anyway, at this lunch, my coworker Megan and I who get along really well were kind of venting about a guy who we work with, who interrupts us a lot, talks over us and shit like that, doesn't really pick up on social cues... 

I'm not too bothered by him, he is like that to everyone and it isn't like he's being disrespectful to us because we're women, he's just kind of socially oblivious towards everyone. But I was frustrated enough about him talking over parts of my presentation that morning that I was venting a little.

It totally wasn't the best choice to vent in front of more people... I'll be the first to admit that. 

Julia started saying stuff about how that isn't right and how I ought to go to HR. I said I didn't think it had come to that at all, so I'd deal with this in person. 

Anyway, a few days later, Julia came to my desk and told me she'd arranged a meeting with HR, and to come with her now. 

I was baffled and went ""Why?"" And she said that she was doing this because of what Megan and I said at lunch about him speaking over us. 

I said ""It wasn't your place to say."" And didn't get up. 

She said to come to the meeting she'd arranged and I said no, I was busy, I didn't have time to do this. I had actual work to be doing. I told her to tell anyone who might be expecting me that she was mistaken and I had no complaints and nothing to report.

She left and seemed frustrated, and so was I. I've dealt with HR before (at a previous company, about much much more serious stuff) and I just didn't think this was something I wanted to take to HR. 

And even if it had been something worth reporting, I'd want the power to do it on my terms, when I was ready, and after I'd prepared with solid evidence, because I know HR departments won't do shit unless you make them think the company could be in legal trouble.

So later that day, I got a meeting request from HR and I figured I knew why. The HR guy told me someone had reported that I felt my coworker talks over women too much. I said that the person who made the report must have misunderstood something, or taken something out of context, because that is not something I have said. And that was that.

I’ve been working since I was 16 but this is my first full time job with a pay above minimum wage. 

I got my first paycheque from the job this week and I was of course psyched. I put 50% of it into savings, used 25% to lay some of my expenses (groceries, my phone bill etc) and I decided I wanted to take my parents out for a nice dinner with some of the remaining money. My parents are lovely people whom I get a lot with and I wanted to do this for them as a thank you because they support me while I’m doinf this internship and going to school (I.e my mom drives me to the train so I can catch it to get to work, sometimes my dad does my laundry and they don’t gave me pay rent). 

I made a reservation for 3 for our favourite slightly higher end restaurant at 7. My older brother (30) who lives with us was supposed to be out that night anyways so I thought it was perfect. He and I don’t really get along anyways and this was supposed to be a treat for my parents. However my brothers plans got canceled at the last minute and he asked what my parents were doing for dinner and if there’d be enough for him because he would be around. The told him we were going out and he asked to come with us. At first I really just wanted to say no but I said “okay as long as you pay for yourself.” 

I didn’t want to pay for him because 
A) this was a dinner for my parents and I celebrating my first big paycheque and thanking them for what they do for me
B) I could afford to pay for 4 people st this restaurant but I wasn’t planning on it and I didn’t particularly want the extra expense as my brother drinks a fair amount if alcohol 
C) My brother does not help me in the way my parents do (I obviously don’t expect him to tho) and in fact actually makes me life worse with his attitude and idiosyncrasies 

My brother agreed to pay for himself but I think he didn’t know I was paying for my parents. After having a lovely dinner and splitting the cheque into 3 even ways (parents, me, brother), I picked the cheque up for my parents and I. My brother said “you’re paying for mom and dad?” And I said that yes this was my treat for them. He said “wow thanks for treating me” sarcastically and was angry and sullen the rest of the night with me.

0,"AITA For telling my Roommate to quit doing everything at the same time as me | This is a throwaway account and I am not from an English speaking country, so I am sorry if anything is unclear.

I am currently in college and am living in an apartment owned by my dad which is near the college, regardless I am responsible for the bills and paying rent as such I got a roommate to lessen the financial strain.

I am not a huge fan of my roommate, he is a bit of an odd guy, keeps trying to use my stuff and seems to be under the impression we are friends which is odd considering we have only known for a month, don't talk often and have nothing in common. But he pays on time and he cleans up after himself so that's the best you can ask for, right?

Well besides his quirks and odd behavior which I am fine dealing with there is one thing about him that is driving me up the wall. The dude keeps doimg stuff at the same time as I do it.

To give you an example from yesterday in my country it is normal to eat dinner between 5 and 8, so I got home late, had studying to do so finally decided to start cooking at 9, aiming to quickly put something together, eat and go back to studying. But instead the moment I start cooking this dude decides he ""Forgot to make dinner"" and also starts making dinner to note I am very tall, he is very broad and the kitchen is tiny, added to that he keeps asking me to borrow kitchen utensils, pans, machines etc which I am literally using and this basically happens every time I cook at home. At first I figured we could just take turns cooking for the both of us but he is on a new diet every week so that won't work. Or the fact I got an xBox in the living room and whenever I play it he suddenly shows up wanting to play as well, when I need to use the bathroom he needs to use it, when I vacuum he wants to vacuum, when I do my laundry he does his laundry and so forth, it is like me doing basic shit reminds him he has to do it so he does it straight away. You may think I am overreacting but this shit makes every fking thing I do frustrating and in the case if cooking and such means it takes way longer.

So this morning I went up to him and told him to stop doing stuff exactly the same time as me, he got offended and said he pays rent, I told him he is right but that doesn't mean he has to do stuff exactly when I do it, its annoying as hell, he seemed really offended.

0,"AITA for pushing someone's dog away with my foot | This happened last summer but I just remembered the incident again so I'm wondering.

I was leaving on my summer vacation and taking a ferry home. There was a small group of people sitting next to me with a big yellow dog (labrador? sorry I'm bad with breeds). I don't even know if such big pets are allowed in the lounge area but I guess that's a moot point now.

Now I have to point out I (24f) didn't grow up with pets so I'm not comfortable having them in my space. It was fine as long as the dog was sitting by the owners' side and playing with them but I got spooked as it tried to come up to me. I moved to side a bit but the leash was long and it could still reach me and sniff me. So essentially it could have licked me or bit me if it wanted to.

I told the group multiple times I wasn't comfortable and asked respectfully if they could keep the dog closer to their table. They seemed annoyed and although they did call it over couple of times, for the most of the trip they ignored what their own pet was doing. And I couldn't move anywhere else because the ferry was packed with both locals and tourists, unless I wanted to stand on my feet with all the baggage for the next 2 hours.

When the dog got way too close at one point, I was already annoyed so I (gently) pushed it away with my foot. The owners saw me and got pissed that I touched their dog with my dirty shoe. What about their possibly dirty dog touching me though? And I didn't hurt it in any way.

At least they kept the dog away from then on but I still think they overreacted given their lack of consideration for other people on a packed ferry.

Us and two other roommates are about to move into a larger rental home to accommodate all of our needs and give us more privacy from each other.

The BF and I usually take the master as our roommates are single, but we split everything evenly which roughly equates to the BF and I paying half of the bills with our combined portions.

The BF and I have been discussing practicalities and trying to plan for him to be away from home (and thus be unable to control most of his accounts while abroad) and we've got most everything ironed out except for this: I want him to continue paying his portion of rent while he's away.

His portion is just shy of $500 while he's expecting to make just shy of 2k per month to start with while away. I'm not asking him to pay utilities (he won't be using them obvs) or anything, but I feel that it's only fair he continue paying his portion of rent.

Why?

We're about to get a more expensive place and putting a double portion on me is incredibly unfair as my income could not reasonably support that. If he's going to stop paying when he's away then I don't want to move.

Anyway, I met with a friend for brunch a few days ago, and she was commenting on me looking a lot better, so I told her it was because I made lifestyle changes and started seeing a personal trainer. She started asking me about him, so I answered a lot of her questions. She asked me if I could send her the workout I was using and my meal plan. I told her that our caloric needs, strength level, etc. would be different so it would be better for her to hire her own trainer and nutritionist. 

She seemed a bit miffed but I thought nothing of it. Later on she asked me for his contact information over Facebook. My friend can be a bit of a cheapskate, and in the past I've referred her to someone and gotten embarrassed by her conduct. I referred her to my hair stylist and she tried to use a groupon (for a different salon) and tried to get her to give her a discount.

In the past my hair stylist has used me as a hair model for certain things so I have gotten free or low cost services, but I never thought my friend would be so cheap (she wears designer clothes, shops at Nordstrom, etc). I was mortified and personally apologized to my hair stylist and chewed my friend out over that. 

Since I didn't want a repeat of last time, I told her that I didn't feel comfortable referring her to my trainer because of the scene last time, because my personal trainer charges an amount that she would think is absurd, and because she's one of those people who the stars must align for before she works out (she has an excuse for everything). I also know they wouldn't get along and he'd probably fire her as a client after a few weeks. 

She argued with me and I ended the conversation abruptly by linking her to multiple personal trainers that I don't personally use.

Backstory: When I was 20 I was at a party and ended up sleeping with a girl who we will call Tracy (she was 22 at the time). I did not know this girl at all, I just saw her with her friends and thought she was attractive.

Anyway around 3-4 weeks later I got a text from a random number saying it was Tracy from the party saying something she needed to tell me something, she said that she was pregnant and that it is my child. I was shocked and asked her how she knows it was my child and she just replied that she had not slept't with anyone else for weeks before me and that Im the only person she has been with. This made sense since I did not use protection and used the pull out method (which was stupid of me).

I said that even if this child was mine I cannot support one at the moment and asked her if she was going to get a abortion. She said she would not and that she wanted to keep it and that I should help her since its my child as well. I said that I would help her financially but I do not want to be apart of this kids life at all as I do not want children. She keep nagging me saying that he will need a father figure but I refused. She backed down eventually and I never ended up paying for any child support because she never asked afterwards or pressured me afterwards.

Story: I never really thought about my child afterwards until about a month ago I got a message from someone on facebook saying that they were my son. I was confused at first but after asking them they said that their mothers name was Tracy and I knew it was true. They asked to meet up at some point as they always wanted to know their farther. 

I said no as I have never wanted children and I blocked him and told my girlfriend about it and she got legit angry. She said that I should have at least met him over a coffee and explained why I was never in his life rather than just completely dismissing him.

Recently, I realized that my son is amassing a massive mess in his room every week and just leaving it for the housekeeper to clean. I told the housekeeper to stop doing his room. He told me I’m being unfair because I have said in the past that he can keep his room however he wants it as long as it’s not a health or fire hazard. I feel that he is taking advantage of the system.

1,"AITA for not giving my girlfriend the profits from a watch she gave me? | My girlfriend's dad died 4 years ago. It's taken some time but she decided she was ready to get rid of some of his stuff. 
She was getting rid of some of his clothes and told me to take anything I fancied before it went to the charity shop. 

In the box were lots of his clothes but also a box with his military dog tags and watches from when he was in the army, some coins too. I told her and she quickly realised and took the dog tags and coins out as she wanted to keep them. 
There were 3 watched in the box and I asked if I could have the gold watch. She said sure and I took it along with a belt and necklace. 

A few months passed and the watch broke. I took it to a shop to be fixed and the guy said it was super valuable and actually worth over £300+ if fully functional. He checked it out and offered me the £300 there and then. 
I was at a hard point in my life and had car insurance due, rent due and money owed to a credit card and my MOT due. I took him up on the offer and then excitedly rang my girlfriend to tell her. 

At first, she got mad and said I better get it back and that she didn't give it me to sell it. I said that it was being given away anyway and she said that no, the clothes were to be given away but when she realised she had the box of dog tags and watches was in there, she took it out and only gave me that watch because it was me who asked. 

I said that I was sorry for the misunderstanding but that what's done is done and I can't just go and get it back because the guy will sell it for a profit, not just to sell back to me for what he bought it. She asked how much I got, I said £300 and she screamed at me and said it was worth way more than £1,000. I checked this later and in fact it's worth around £800-900. 

She then said if I'd sold it then she wanted at least some of the money. I said I'd already booked my MOT and paid off my credit card. She cried and said I'm an asshole. We spoke the next day and she said she was genuinely reconsidering our relationship. 

I don't think I did anything wrong at all, but AITA?

0,"AITA for taking my ex to court for back child support? | My ex and I divorced in 2008. We have 4 kids together. Short version of the why is that he knocked up his girlfriend while they were deployed (and still married to me).  At the time, my oldest was 15 and youngest was 8. 
Child support was always an issue. He wanted to pay into separate bank accounts for each of the children so that he wouldn’t have to pay me at all. That’s not how this works.. so he paid me. BUT, he paid me what he felt like he should pay and not what the court order stated... 
Fast forward to this passed Monday- we’re in court because 1. I finally had the money to take him to court and 2. The kids are older and not as likely to get pulled into this. (Side note: I’ve kept all this BS from them all this time so that they didn’t have to feel like they had to choose sides)
So, we’re in court.. my two oldest kids walk in with my ex.. planning to testify that THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A DIME OF CHILD SUPPORT COME TO THEM FROM ME... 
I’m devastated. I am still in shock and total disbelief. 
Ex has been sporadically present during their childhood and never sent Christmas or birthday presents/cards.. nothing. The three times he’s had them for Christmas in the ten years we’ve been divorced is the only time they’ve received any gifts of any kind. 
So... before we get in front of the judge and shit goes down- ex tells his lawyer to tell my lawyer that he does in fact owe me exactly how much I’ve claimed and just wants to set up a payment plan. 
The kids haven’t made eye contact with me or acknowledged me in any way the entire time. 8hrs. Nothing.
We get out of court... I’ve discovered that my kids have blocked me from all social media, disconnected from my Netflix account, blocked my number on their phones, stopped sharing location on the phones... basically cut me off without saying a freaking word to me.  
So why am I the asshole for taking him to court? What did I do to warrant being shut out of their lives? I raised them and gave them everything they needed and wanted even when I couldn’t afford it. I found a way. I went without more times than I can count so that they would have what they needed.... they’re all good students and I’ve put three into and through college. The oldest went into the army instead.

0,"AITA for telling my mom that she was wrong about money usage? | Ok so a bit of background: i live in a family of 4, mom and dad are divorced, i have a brother and a pomeranian dog, i am currently 21 YO. This happened 4 years ago but i still don't knowbif i blame myself or her. 


So my brother is 4 years older than me, graduated universety with a biology degree, traveled to London to pursue his education in Forensic science for a whole year and now is in the military.

My parents kept on sending him money by the loads (like 2000 pounds each 2 months) i asked them if its not too much and if there is going to be enough left for me to do my masters locally or abroad. They told me that yes they saved up a significant amount just for my education and nothing and no one will use for anything else. 


After my brother finished his masters and returned, i was closing in on finishing my liscence in management and ready to head directly in masters. But then my parents got devorced (wich costs us a shit load) and my mom wanted to move out. I decided to join her, we went and searched for a nice place, and nice neighborhood, we also went a chose the furniture (every single thing) and we payed and moved in. Little did i know that the money that my mom used was MY masters money. I was pissed off more than i think i will ever be. 


Now i need to tell you that my mom is the nicest person i know and she told me she feelt bad when purchasing the furnitures but didn't think i was good enough in university (my grades where averaged between 10/20 and 12/20) and went ahead and payed for them with the saved up load. 


Now my dad is paying the fee while i search for a job, i hate the place we are at because of this situation. 

I talked to my mom about it and told her that what she did was wrong and an asshole move and that i felt hurt that she, my own mom, didn't think i had what it got to reach higher levels of education. She made me feel like a disappointment im comparison with my brother when i opened this subject.

0,"AITA for using gym equipment someone else was using? | I (20 M) go to the gym after work at 5:30pm, and have done for the past year or so and this has become part of my routine. 

For some background, the gym isn’t the biggest but it’s the most reasonably priced within my local area it’s also short walk from my workplace and many other offices. Because of this factor, the gym is extremely busy from 5-7pm on week nights. 

Today, I was in the gym and went towards what I thought to be a free bench press. There was still weights on each side of  the barbell, so I visibly had a quick glance around to see if anyone was using it and come to the conclusion that someone had just not bothered taking the weights off each side, annoying but no big deal. 

I sit down to start my set when a guy stands over me, then tells me he was already here and would be no longer than 5 minutes. Again no big deal, I assumed he just went for water etc and had just got back. Fine, I move. 

He then goes back to using the free weights and a bench. Now I understand during quiet periods people do occasionally use multiple machines at once but this gym is packed. 

This is where I’m unsure if I became the asshole, but fuck that guy I’m using the bench I went and sat back down. He didn’t notice for around a few minutes, but quickly went out his way and  asked me to move once he noticed. I explained it was busy, I wanted to finish my set before leaving which I did. He suggested I was just trying to ‘piss him off’

1,"AITA for asking my boyfriend to pick up and drop off my child on weekends which made him suggest a break up? | So for full disclosure my partner works full time and is usually at work from 7am-7pm, and I have a weekend job that requires me to be away from 9am-12pm. We don’t live together but we are local so we are always in and out of each other’s homes. 

My son decided he wanted to play football on weekends- he’s 12 years old and really excited about it. I was initially going to ask my bf if he could pay for it but I mentioned it to my mum when I went around for a cup of tea and she was strongly expecting me to pay and told me it was my responsibility not my bf’s... even though he’s been in my life 3 years. 

So I ended up having to pay but in order to afford it I extended my hours at work to 9-5. I asked my bf if he’d be willing to pick up and drop off my son on weekends as obviously if be at work and he looked uncomfortable and said sorry no can’t his dad drop him? 

I admit I snapped at him and told him that his dad lives in south London whereas we live in north London and his dad doesn’t drive but my boyfriend does. I asked him if he really wanted to be part of this family and if he did he wouldn’t mind doing small stuff like this for me. I suppose his dad COULD take him but what would be a 1 hour + journey for his dad would take 15 minutes for my bf. 

He got really angry and told me that he was having to work longer hours to support me and my son and that he wanted to use his weekends to go to football games etc as I wasn’t at home anyway. He said that he wanted to chill and relax and that I was forcing things on him way too quick. He then suggested that we break up bc ”I was putting too many responsibilities on him” and I was like.. really? Over a bloody football game? Welcome to the real world love!

1,"AITA for outright refusing to ever do the dishes | This happened over a year ago with an ex, and reading all the weird relationship stories here got me wondering if I was an AH over this situation. TLDR below. 

I lived with my ex for 2 years in a nice place. We both worked, me full time and her part time but full time school. Honestly it went really well the whole time, but this was the one big argument we ever had. We split up chores just based on what needed to be done. We never had to ask the other person to do anything really, stuff just got done, except for the dishes. I would do them much less, and we had no dishwasher. 

It came to a point when she suggested we set up days where each person is on shift for dishes. At this point I told her I absolutely hated doing the dishes (and still do). I don't like getting my hands wet, I hate the disgusting food on the plates and the smell from stuff I hadn't eaten. I told her I would prefer to just take over more chores in exchange for never having to do the dishes. She couldn't accept that, and tried to convince me more but I never backed down. I told her I would do basically everything else that needed to be done, even if she requested it, just to avoid doing the dishes. She again refused, and for the remainder of our time there I only did the dishes one more time while we continued splitting up the other chores.

I keep the kitchen spotless. Counters are constantly spotless, I buy new drip pans for the stove every 2-3 months, I load and unload the dishwasher 1-2 times a day and there are rarely dishes sitting in the sink for longer than 10 minutes after dinner. I also cook dinner for my roommates every night. I don't resent it - the kitchen is my baby, I love to cook, this isn't the problem for me. Hell - I insisted on these roles.

I am sick of it. I have sat them down several times (6 times) and told them I am feeling incredibly disrespected that I am expected to maintain the kitchen because rotting dishes are disgusting, yet they ask for my help every time they want to clean out the borderline hoarders nest that every other room turns into.

So, i have very bad eyes. My vision is just overall blurry, but i also have pretty bad double vision and loss of my peripheral vision because of a disorder i have. My glasses correct the blurriness and double vision (to an extent). 

I try to keep my glasses on pretty much all the time, except for when i’m showering. My sister has a bad habit of taking off her eyelashes in the shower and putting them on the rim of the bathtub part. 

Well, the eyelashes tend to kind of roll up into a circular shape. Without my glasses, this looks like a giant-ass furry spider. I’m normally not too afraid of spiders and bugs but that changes when you’re naked. 

So i see this weird spider looking thing coming into the shower, and start freakin out. I cupped my hands and used the water to guide it towards the drain until it was washed down.

A friend of mine wanted to go to a restaurant for his birthday and asked toto RSVP so that he could reserve a table. The restaurant hadn’t been open very long, but it already had a built in audience since it was part of a franchise. About 25 people answered. 

I am always the one that’s on time, which is early for everyone else, and that day was no exception. No one was there, not even my friend, but still, I told the hostess that I was part of the group, and she told me that they already had the table waiting, but I must wait for my friend. That was fine, he got there 10mins later. He approached the hostess to ask her to take us to the table, and she refused. She said that she could only sit ya if there was half of the people he had reserved there. We were shocked, we had never heard of such policy before, especially at a franchise spicy chicken wings place, and also we knew that our friends were not going to be there on time. 

We had to wait for an hour and a half on the sitting room. We saw how the place went from mildly busy to packed, and from the sitting room we could see our reserved table and how they never touched it. They just wouldn’t let us go in until half the people were there. 

At the moment I thought that it was because they didn’t want the waiter to get confused on our orders, but turns out that’s what he did later. 

Maybe having only 1 waiter for a 25 people table and have him still wait on his whole section wasn’t a good idea, but he still made a lot of mistakes. If we asked for water he brought Coke and when we tried to send it back, he told us that it was already in the system and he had to charge us for the water in addition since he couldn’t delete the coke. He did this with several items and people had to pay double for food they didn’t order. The bill was astronomically high at the end of the night, and there was food on the table that no one touched because we hadn’t ordered it. We asked to speak with the manager and he said that the waiter was right in how he had handled it, and there was no way to fix his mistakes. 

We only paid for the food we originally ordered and left.

0,"AITA? - I Got Someone Fired for Calling a Female Worker the C Word, but he Said it to me in Private. | Context: This happened many years ago while I was at my first job at a movie theater. I was 17 years old and so was everyone else involved in the story, except our manager. I have always thought about this and feel bad for the kid, I would just like to know if people think I'm an AH or if I did the right thing.

I used to work at a movie theater restaurant. I was a runner/busser. My fellow department's job was to essentially run out the food and drink, and to clean theaters in between showtimes. We always had a team lead that was in charge of the department for the day - they would basically direct who would clean what theaters and who would run out drinks and food unless a manager intervened, which was uncommon. There would be anywhere between 5-20 of us on at any given time.

That night, it was fairly quiet. This girl, I'll call her Kendall (16 F) was our team lead for the night. She was a great worker, but could be bossy I suppose, but not if you were cordial with her. I was working with her and about 7 other bussers that night. This dude, I'll call him Lance (16 M) was fairly new to the theater. It was maybe his 6th week on the job or so. He was already pissing off managers by taking forever to run out food or drink (he was fairly heavyweight and did not have the best work ethic).

Well this night, Lance was being told what to do by Kendall and did not seem to enjoy this very much. She was a good leader and would make sure we weren't screwing around. She continuously kept good tabs on Lance, and often told him what to do when we were bussing the theaters (sweep, wipe, leave to help run food, etc.) Well Lance was getting pretty fed up it would seem. After finishing a theater, he and I were standing outside together. Kendall comes up and tells him to head down to another theater to start cleaning. ""What a Cu\*t"" he says to me as she walks away. He didn't intend for her to hear ( I don't think), but still I was caught off guard as she was our leader for the night and he was so new there.

About 10 minutes later Kendall and I were cleaning the theater, Lance was off doing something else. This was annoying Kendall. I decided to let her know what he said about her, since I knew her for months and she was a buddy of mine, Lance was not. Kendall did not approve of this, and she went and told our Manager. Within 20 minutes, Lance was fired.

The managers were not impressed with Lance, and the job did have a high turnover due to the constant crowds and running around all over the place the entire dinner rush on weekends. I believe that if he wasn't fired for this, he may have been fired for something else sooner rather than later. But, that is just my opinion.

He then proceeds to just stand there and ramble about stuff that is vaguely related to the topic while not teaching us anything. Wednesday he spent over 25 minutes letting us philosophies on how we should layout a web page despite the fact he hasn't taught a single html tag in class.

&#x200B;

The worst part by far though is the work load. For the next 14 days we have various small irrelevant things due and almost 4 chapters of reading. Despite being a web programming class, tonight we have to write a page paper pretending to ""advertise"" our website. The thing that pissed me off though is that he never announced any of this in class or though the announcement channel. Last night we had our first reading and first project due (4th day of the semester). We had to build a simple site in html despite the fact he never announced that 2 chapters of the book were due or the project in class. This morning when we came people were complaining and he told them ""tough luck"" and to pay closer attention to the due dates.

&#x200B;

As class was getting started people were still complaining so he announced that he would reopen it for tonight but I raised my hand and told him that it still does not make it right because he has yet to teach us anything about html. He then told me that it's my responsibility to read and learn and that he wont be repeating what's said in the book because that is ""not his job"". He then said that the book will teach us and we are supposed to come to class with that knowledge.

&#x200B;

Most of the kids in this class are freshman with only 3 or 4 seniors like myself filling the credit requirements. I have never had a class like this and every programming teacher i've had at least introduced us to the languages before and I told him this. He got defensive and told me that this is preparing me for the real world. So I stood up and with everyone looking at me told him ""Well, if the real world will consist of a out of tough old man who is more concerned about being cool than setting the people below him up for success then I might as well give up now. If it isn't clear i'm dropping this class. You're a clown and i'm not sticking around for this"" and walked out.

My street is VERY tiny but also has street parking. Due to the street parking, only one car can go at a time. Turning around is a BITCH. 


A few of the neighbors have a driveway, including the neighbor directly across from me. I do not have a driveway. It’s just a dirt path that has to stay clear because it leads to a back side street. Sorry if this is confusing but we live in a historic district with very awkward layouts. 


Anyway, every day when I have to leave for work, I pull in to my dirt path and back out. When I back out, the tail end of my car goes in to my neighbors driveway


NOTE: I have never driven on their grass or yard—strictly the edge of their driveway. I don’t even go in, just enough to back my car up a bit to turn around.



Recently, my neighbor put up cones in her driveway every morning. They are gone by the time I get home from work. To me, this was incredibly petty. Like, i can’t use the EDGE of your driveway to back up? I’m not parking there, going in your yard, or blocking anyone in. I’m just turning around to go to work. 



So I started hitting the cones. Just a little bump because I barely need that much space to turn around but if they are in my way and get a little bump, oh well. Doesn’t hurt my car.



Now my neighbor has told on me to my landlord. My landlord thinks she’s a crazy bitch but gave me a heads up just in case I want to keep the peace with her. He doesn’t care what I do.

My gf and I share a closet that we both go into every morning to get dressed for work. The closet uses a sliding door that means that only one half of the closet can be accessed at a time (I have half, she has half).

The issue is that she often leaves her shoes in the line of the sliding door instead of pushing them all the way into the closet or just putting then elsewhere. I never bother to move her shoes and simply slide the door over them because I just want to get ready and don't want to move them. This obviously scuffs the shoes where the door hit them and she got mad at me for ruining some of her shoes. I however take the stance that it is a natural consequence of leaving things directly in the path of the sliding door that she knows will have to move through there every day and it is instead her fault for placing her shoes there (I always make sure my stuff is out of the way).",False,False,2,3,1,2,1,3,Fairness|Proportionality
0,"AITA for having security track down my colleague after hitting my car? | Well this is a strange one. I think I was completely right, but my colleagues think I have been weird and unreasonable. 

I work in a building that has an underground car park. Last week, I went downstairs to find that my car had been hit. The front bumper has been cracked and scratched, but no other damage. There was no note on the car. I went to a car body shop and they told me I would be looking at around £500 to supply and fit a new bumper. My car insurance excess is £750 so there is no point in going through them as they will put my premium up come renewal. 

I went to my work reception and informed them, and they basically told me that there was nothing that they can do. So I went to a manager at my office, and they initially seemed concerned, but they came and saw my car and told me that there was hardly any damage and I should just forget about it. So then I went to building security, and asked them to find the CCTV so I could find out who hit my fucking car. 

The next day i got a call from them to say they had the footage, and that they knew who had hit my car. I went to their office, and sure enough they have footage of one of my colleagues getting into her car, reversing into mine, getting out and looking at it, and then driving off. 

I confronted my colleague and she initially denied it, but when I told her that it was on CCTV she then admitted to it. She then said that she saw the damage wasn't that bad so figured nothing would ever come of it and that would be the end of it. She then asked how I knew it was her, and I told her that I went to building security and got them to look back on the CCTV recordings. She then starts acting very dismissive saying that I am being unreasonable, the damage isn't that bad, and that it is ""a bit weird"" that I have gone to all that effort for minor damage. She also said that she wouldn't pay for the damage. 

As if that wasn't bad enough, a few of my colleagues have said that it was a bit weird to go through all that effort for ""nothing"" and that I should just drop it and move on

So, am I being weird? Am I unreasonable? Should I just accept this, pay £500 out of my own pocket and move on?

0,"WIBTA if I tell employers why I was fired? | I (24f) live in a smaller neighborhood within a medium-sized city. My kids are in school here and husband have a good apartment that we can actually afford. There are lots of local businesses, a great community, and lots of connections and interactions between groups of people/areas. 

Until recently I worked for a local business which is a specialty store in an subject area where I have particular knowledge and skills. I was hired two years ago by an awesome older lady - she trained us to do most of the store tasks: ordering, creating displays, social media, running events and community groups, etc on our own. This was great until she sold the business and retired. 

The new owner is a retired government drone (I'll call her Karen), WASP, micromanager, and in way over her head. She has a habit of changing how we do things impulsively , which causes issues, then sending passive-aggressive emails, misreading stuff and blowing up at people over these issues, and just generally not cool behaviour sometimes. She had high standards for us, but hey, her store, her prerogative. I didn't work the same days as she was in, so not a big deal for me, and her outbursts usually blew over fast and I could avoid the worst of it. 

However, a couple weeks ago there was an incident at the store Karen felt we didn't handle well, and she sent multiple angry, accusatory, and passive-aggressive emails, texts, and a voicemail. In one email about 12 hours after this incident Karen berated my shift parter and I for not apologizing immediately for our role. 

I'd had enough and sent an email back saying, pretty politely and calmly (coworkers vouched for this) that, a) I was not ok with how she was handling this (way of accusing us, sending multiple emails and texts, her tone), b) the one berating email particularly was not helpful for figuring out what happened in the incident and how to rectify it with my coworker and I, and c) I was not going to engage with the angry behaviour over email and we could talk about it in person the next day. She emailed back a really angry response immediately, at the end of which she fired me. No warning, no acknowledgement of the issues I raised except to say I was being ridiculous. Ok, fine, good riddance, and I'm moving on. Maybe I deserved it for getting involved.

The WIBTA issue is this: I need to get another job in the same neighbourhood, among business owners who know Karen and the store I used to work at. Can I tell them the above, or the gist of it, or am I the AH for speaking ill of her and her management style?

Basically the issue is that whenever I meet new people I will introduce my girlfriend as my girlfriend rather than my fiancee. At first I think she brushed it off but now she's been getting annoyed at me and brought it up in conversation a few times. I refuse to stop though; I don't like the idea of a ""fiancee"" to me you're either married or you're not. For now we are just boyfriend and girlfriend, and in a few months we will be husband and wife, there is no need for an intermediate stage.

She has been very insistent that I refer to her as my fiancee but the most I am willing to say is ""my girlfriend who I am engaged to"". It really is a matter of personal preference and not something that should matter at all in my view; to her though it's really important.

He's basically on-stage between every divisions performance, making jokes and small theatrical numbers while the crew is preparing the stage for the next divisions performance.

Last year my brother couldn't find anyone in the club willing to photograph the show, so he asked me (M 21) if I'd be willing to do it, as I am a hobby photographer with rather professional equipment. I agreed, and photographed the whole thing and delivered a few dozen pics to use for their website and what not. My mother then asked if she could have some of the pics to design a photobook for my brother as a christmas gift. I was happy to help and my brother loved the gift.

Ok so fast forward to this year.

The preparations for the show are almost done as the show is set in two weeks. As my brother hasn't asked me to be the photographer again yet, I assumed he found someone from the club that would do it. But now two weeks before the event he asked me anyway. I was a little taken confused as to why hed ask me just two weeks in advance, which seemed a little on short notice. So I asked him how come they didnt have a photographer lined up yet, and how come he didnt ask me earlier.

He then tells me that they in fact have a photographer but he wants me to take photos too, so he could get a photobook again.

So I told him that:

1. I dont want to photograph alongside another photographer
2. He can get a photobook made from their photos too

I was there in my capacity as a mystery shopper: think of me like an undercover hotel critic that produces an internal review for the hotel owners: I wasn't leaving a nasty yelp review.

I was reviewing an upscale ""boutique"" hotel in the Hamptons, where the rooms were costing me $500 a night (not that I was paying out of pocket, but that shows you the clientele whose mindset I was trying to put myself into). The hotel was in a converted summer camp with bungalows and a ""rustic"" theme. One thing that was advertised on their website was that every room came with a grill for barbecuing. So when I came to check in, I brought some meat with me to BBQ since I hadn't done so in a while.

To my surprise, while the grills were advertised online, there was no charcoal or fuel. When I went to the front desk to ask for some, the woman running the front desk seemed surprised, and then recommended me a store nearby where I could buy some. I mentioned that it was a long walk away, and she offered to let me rent a bike free of charge to go there.

I've reviewed plenty of luxury hotels in this job, and for $500 a night I would expect them to stock charcoal so I could grill if it's advertised on the website. And if they *didn't*, they should have sent someone to a store or supplier to go get me some, without my asking. I did notice that there only seemed to be one bellman or porter for the entire hotel, and very little staff overall. To be clear: I am perfectly capable of riding a bike to the store and buying charcoal, but while I was *mildly* miffed that it wasn't available or provided to me for free (or as part of a resort fee) I would imagine the target clientele might be *more* pissed.

In my internal review, I was asked if the staff fulfilled my needs and I said no. I later polled a few other people in my industry, and people seemed split down the middle about whether it was reasonable to expect charcoal be provided, that if it wasn't provided someone should've gone to the store *for* me, and if whether or not suggesting a store and offering a bicycle for me to buy my own charcoal ""fulfilled my needs.""

But as this is his senior year, he's been paying for his college applications because I want to teach him how to become a responsible adult and pay for his future.  I pay for a lot of things like his car registration, half of his new phone (he pays the other half) and school functions like prom and winter ball, I even hired a college applications advisor for him, but we got into a fight yesterday about this because he feels that since college is non-negotiable, I should pay for the fees.

She was going to an appointment so she drove us into the city, then rather than spend money on parking she asked me to drive the van back to the spot where we were staying. During that 20 minute drive I had the air con for a little while - it was a hot day. 

Fast forward a day or two later and we are driving somewhere and I suggest we put the air con on. She says we can't because it's broken, and it may start leaking. I say 'oh shit I wish I'd known yesterday as I had it on for part of the journey'. But no leaking so we both forget about it I assumed.

Now last night, I receive some texts from her about how its started leaking and I say that's annoying, then she says she's gonna have to send me the invoice to get it fixed. 

I tell her I think that's unfair for a few reasons, such as it being already broken and she hadn't given me prior warning. Additionally, I think part of owning a vehicle means accepting wear and tear and maintenance costs, and paying to fix it is a bonus in itselfs due to the added value of the car.

The grades were announced on September 2019. My class threw a huge wobbly about it because most of our grades SUCKED. Many opted to hide the grades from their parents but of course the school issued a letter stating the grades shortly after they got out.

I guess this friend got lucky and intercepted the letter before her parents received it. I adviced them to own up and tell. Their grades aren't flawless, to be frank, but they're not dreadful either. Just a bunch of Cs and Bs. They dismissed me.

Several days ago, I met her mother. We were talking and the subject of IGCSE came up. She complained that the certificates are taking a while to arrive. That's where I went ""screw it"" and told her that the grades and certificates are out already, didn't she know?

I put them all into my cart initially and the £10 items were taken off the total, at which point I realised that if I did it as 3 purchases, one with all the £25 items, one with all the £15 items, and one with all the £10 items, I'd save more money, so I went from having about £30 knocked off the total to having about £50 taken off. It wasn't a huge discount but it was nearly double what I would have gotten taken off otherwise, so I put it through as 3 separate purchases.

So when my ex, Sasha, and I were seeing each other she got pregnant. She decided she wanted to keep the baby and go back home to her parents in LA. She already had a daughter and because she would have two kids now she wanted her parents help. I decided that I would stay where I am so I could establish my career, pay child support, and just go visit my child as often as possible.

A year or so later my work offers me a transfer to LA or Dallas. So I of course say yes to LA and move over there. 

Sasha and I started seeing each other again and after awhile we decided we would wanted to get married. We were going to after a long engagement, so I would get some more time to get to know her daughter better. The idea was that if everything went okay I would formally adopt her, so we could all be one family.

Things didn’t end up working out between us though and we broke up a few months ago.

We’ve recently been looking at preschools for our son. Last week we went to see a really nice one near us. Sasha really loves it. It’s a lot nicer than the other preschools, but she thinks we should still send our son to the same one his sister went to because it’s more affordable.

That’s when I brought up that my parents had already set up a education fund for him. I had only found out about it a few days earlier when I brought up looking for preschools with my parents. 

My parents had said they had set up and education fund for each of their grandkids and that we could start using some of the money right now for preschool and private school since the public schools in our area aren’t that good.

We got into talking more about it and how my brothers and sisters kids also have their own educational funds. Including my sisters two stepsons.

Because of that Sasha has asked if I’ll consider still adopting her daughter. She says it would be better for their relationship if her daughter and our son have the same opportunities and I wouldn’t have to do anything more than what I am doing. I told her no right away and the. she said I was a jerk for not even thinking about it.

But I just don’t want to be legally responsible for her daughter anymore. Obviously I’m still going to be in her life because she is my sons sister. Like Ill still take her out to places with my son sometimes, but I just don’t want more responsibility for her than that anymore.

0,"WIBTA for towing a resident from covered parking when it’s about to snow? | I know I have the *right* to tow them, but I’m hoping to find out if I’m morally in the clear - I know “legally right” and “morally right” get mixed up a fair amount. This may end up being a non-issue if it’s resolved before I get home.

Basically: my apartment complex has outdoor parking. There is a small amount of covered spots. There’s a waitlist you have to get on, after which you have to pay $65/month to reserve a specific spot. I got on the waitlist in October and I got my spot in December 2019. The covered parking situation was outlined to me when I moved in April 2019, so it’s fair to assume other new residents are informed as well.

Last night, I got home at 10pm to find that my spot was occupied by another car. I took a pic of their car info and forwarded it to the leasing office. I parked elsewhere uncovered, and left my house at 6:30am today.

At 8am, the leasing office responded saying that they will contact the owner of the car letting them know that they need to move their car. I was informed that if I wanted them to move, I had to contact a towing company myself. I received confirmation via email that the resident was contacted, though I’m not sure by what means.

**My question is this: WIBTA if I have the car towed if the resident hasn’t moved it by the time I get home (6pm)?**

Some further details: I live where it snows. It’s going to snow tonight. For me, $65 every month isn’t nothing. The carport reduces 10 minutes of snow/ice cleanup in the morning to 30 seconds. Given I’m outside at 6/6:30am in freezing and below weather trying to get my car road-ready, it’s unpleasant to deal with. But I am a little worried about retaliation for being so impatient.

On the resident’s part - I don’t know if this is a new resident making a first-time mistake, or if the towing costs would be really damaging to their financial position. They have less than 12 hours’ notice to move it or get towed. I don’t even know if they were contacted in a way that they could feasibly check within 12 hours (phone, email, paper in the door handle...). If I were them - if I made a one-time mistake as a new resident and got stuck with towing fees because another resident was impatient with me - I’d be mad.

Or they’re just some prick who’s lived here a while and didn’t think twice about it. I dunno.

0,"AITA for taking the car I lent to my mom back? | I have been letting my mom and her boyfriend use my car for the last few weeks. I had no problem with this really, because I was able to share my boyfriend’s car with him because we pretty much have opposite work days. 

Yesterday, I went to my mom’s house to do some laundry, and my little cousin asked me for his vape back (which I confiscated from him because he’s too young). The vape was in the glovebox of the car I lent them, and so I went to check if it was in there because I completely forgot about it when I gave them the car. 

The vape was not in the glovebox anymore, so I figured that they got it out and put it away, assuming it was my cousin’s (he’s been known to acquire them countless times). No big deal, I guess. Expect mild agitation they’re going through my glovebox. 

So I go into the house and ask my mom “Hey have you seen a white vape? It was in my glovebox” and she immediately starts yelling at my cousin, completely ignoring my question. This is usually what she does when she’s lying: yell at anyone she can. So I just redirect the attention to me and say it’s mine now because I took it from them and I am giving it back to my cousin’s friend’s mom, who I’m pretty sure they got it from in the first place.

She claims she has no idea and changes the subject. So I just go into the room where the laundry is and check the drawer where they always put vapes they’ve confiscated. Of course it’s there. 

So I ask her boyfriend (who’s been with her for 11 years) if he knows anything about it, he acts like I’m stupid for even asking. But I already know that it was most likely him, he’s gotten into my glovebox before and found lube I left in there and tells everyone in the world about it. 

At this point he’s  just straight lying to my face and going off on me. Accusing me of snooping in their drawer and saying he has no idea how it got in there. He ends up calling me a “stupid fucking cunt” and I tell them I’m taking my car back since they want to steal and lie about it. 



Okay, this is the part where I feel bad. I took the car back. But it’s the only car they have (besides my sisters who also lives there, but still needs the use of her car). I made sure my sister could drive my mom to work before I took the car. I feel like my mom should’ve defended me after he called me that, instead she just yelled at me and my cousin for starting a problem. Her bf has got dr appointments as well, but I honestly don’t care if he gets to them or not. It’s my mom I feel kind of bad for, but the lack of respect is what made me decide to take the car.

0,"AITA for not wanting to look after my autistic younger cousin? |  

Some background, my cousin is 16 and I'm 20. I've always been fond of him, we used to be really close, people would joke about us being brother and sister.

So, last week my uncle called my mum to say that my aunt (who was a recovering alcoholic) had started drinking again and she's not getting out of bed, not showering, not helping to look after my cousin etc... and I just felt this immediate sense of dread because this same thing happened before. When I was 17 my nan got that same exact call, I offered to go with her to check up on my aunt and we ended up coming back with my cousin. I was pretty happy at first, I wasn't seeing much of him at the time so it was nice to be able to spend time with him.

After a while, I realised that my mum had agreed to let him stay at our place while my uncle was trying to get help for my aunt in the hopes that I would be the one looking after him. My mum was working full-time and my sister was away for the summer with a club, which left me as the obvious candidate as I was on my summer holidays. I didn't mind at first, it was nice having him around but looking after him meant that I had to be with him all the time. I had to take him to the park, I had to bring him with me to hospital and dentist appointments (I was late in my recovery from surgery so I had a lot of follow-up appointments). From when he woke up at about 5 in the morning until my mum got home from work at 7, I had to be watching him. I couldn't go out with friends, couldn't even have friends over otherwise he would kick up a fuss. The only alone time I had was at night which is when I like to go on my laptop, listen to music, do some writing but by that time I was too tired to do any of that. There were times when I'd catch him masturbating, not even accidentally walking in on him but he would do it in the open in the living room, would shove his hands down his pants when we were out in public. I would tell him not to do it, he would say sorry but carry on.

That was my whole summer. I was stressed, I was missing out on a lot and I was missing my friends, my mum kept telling me that it wasn't for long, that we (?) were doing it for my aunt. He was here for over 6 weeks. That's the experience that turned me off of wanting to look after him again.

My mum got in touch, told me it's happening again and if I can come home for a week or so to help look after him. I just straight up told her no. I'm older now, I'm living away from home, I'm a student working part-time with amazing friends. I told her that I have a life of my own now, I can't just drop everything and come home to look after my cousin. She got really upset with me and told me I'm being selfish because she has to work and look after my sister (who's now the same age I was when the responsibilty was dumped on me). I told her that it's not fair to just expect me to do it and then hung up on her. I've been trying to forget about it but a part of me feels bad.

I changed my tune and admitted to him that I would love to buy him dinner once I’m on my feet again, but it would not be responsible for me to pay for our sushi dinner.

Around four months ago, I have decided to become a vegetarian. The reasons why are unimportant, what is important though is the impact that that decision is having in my relationship; we've been together for almost six years, and I have always been the one who took care of cooking for both of us. He's quite picky with his food, especially when it comes to vegetables, but before I became a vegetarian it was easy because I could just literally make chicken and potatoes for the two of us and he'd be happy.

However, now that I have changed my eating habits, it has become tougher for me to cook because sometimes I have to think how to make two different meals. He never thinks about buying his own meat or defrosting what he already has on the freezer, won't eat the veggies I make unless they're exactly the way he likes (a very restricted list), and he won't even try to taste vegetarian products I buy for myself to see what it's like (like veggie nuggets, oat milk, that sort of stuff) that could help me find easier ways to make our meals.

On his side he says I'm trying to change the way he eats and it's not fair, but all I feel I'm asking is for him to be a little more concerned now in what happens in the kitchen instead of just demanding food and to try to become more flexible.

I said that’s fine as I’ve had to work 2 jobs at min before to cover bills of my own so she can do it. All seemed well and we finished dinner.

A little later in the evening she came to me saying she found us some places that seem nice. I look at them and they have all the niceties 2 people our age would love then I saw the rent. The common rent for all these was around 2k a month and I said well that’s easily 1k a month from each of us before we add in utilities. She looked a bit stunned when I said utilities so I asked what was up. She said she was hoping I’d cover my half of rent and utilities since I have a higher paying job than she can get. To this I said that wouldn’t be very fair to me to cover those expenses on my own just because I can earn more than she can at the moment. She teared up, ran out of the room and slammed her door shut. My mom went asked me what she’s upset about and I explained the situation to her. She said she understood and went to talk with her. A couple minutes later I get a knock on my from my mom asking to talk. I let her in and she began asking why I wouldn’t be willing to cover utilities. I said because that isn’t fair to me due to having a higher paying job. She didn’t say much and just walked out of the room, I’m guessing, a bit bothered by my answer.

1,"AITA for eating my coworker's food? | So this happened on Friday and I'm still at once racked with guilt and feeling defiant. 

I work in a co-working space with a bunch of other freelancers and start-ups. The communal fridge gets fully cleaned out on a biweekly basis so things don't get gross in there. One of my fellow freelancers told me on Thursday that they were going on holiday on Friday for two weeks. We had a quick chat about it while grabbing coffee about where they were staying, what they have planned etc. They said something about arriving that afternoon, so I had it in mind that they weren't going to be at the office on the Friday. 

So Friday comes along and I forgot to bring my lunch, which I realised as I went to look in the communal fridge around noon. I stood there with the fridge door open, annoyed at myself and so not wanting to step out into the rain to grab something from outside, and suddenly I see that the above mentioned coworker's name was labelled on a microwaveable pad thai. Well, they weren't going to be here anyways and the fridge would be cleared out by the time they return, and plus the food would've surely gone out of date by then, so I figured why not save some food from going to waste.

So I nuke the pad thai, bring it back to my desk, and about an hour later I see that coworker in the office, walking towards the kitchen. Five minutes later, I see them walking back and I overhear them asking another coworker if they'd seen their pad thai. I got up and told them I ate it, apologised and explained the situation, and took cash out to compensate for having eaten their lunch. They gave me a wtf look, didn't really accept my apology (but accepted the cash) and told me that was a really weird thing to do. Also explained that they were flying straight after work (after I expressed by surprise that they were still here). So that left me with a weird empty feeling for the rest of the weekend, despite being full from their lunch. 

TLDR; I thought my coworker was out of town and left food in the communal fridge when I forgot my lunch, so I ate their food, but it turned out they weren't out of town.

0,"AITA for kicking someone out over spoilers? | More specifically, that and their attitude after the spoilers occurred.

So this actually happened a few hours ago, and after a period of radio silence between us, I'm left wondering if he or I were the one to overreact. 

Alrighty, so on to the story. The person I'm seeing (32m) and I (27f) enjoy watching shows together. Generally speaking he picks them because he has kind of a different taste than I do (ie, I could watch mad reruns of The Office and be content, but he likes to mix it up, and watching shows with more grit). Now, in principle, I'm generally fine with this because he does show me things I haven't seen before that I do end up enjoying (although I have had to put a foot down once or twice when I'm completely disinterested in a show, and he puts it on anyway... but that's a whole different ball o' wax...).

So today we were watching one of His Shows, that took me a little while to get into, but I'm beginning to be invested in the storyline, so I'm actively watching as well. At the end of the episode, there was a moment off camera with a gunshot, and it was framed like Female Character would die. I reacted like, ""oh no,"" so he says, ""Don't worry, she doesn't die,"" which peeved me, but I felt was said with good intentions. The next episode comes up, Female Character actually shot someone else, and the story moves on.

He followed my sigh of relief with, ""She does die later though.""..... Like wtf dude, ok spoilers much?

So I asked him to give away nothing more because I would like to watch the story unfold. He counters my request by saying, ""Well, Male Character dies, too..."" .... Male Character also hasn't died yet... 

So I asked him to say nothing more about it, or I just don't want to watch this with him right now cuz he was ruining it for me. He complains that, ""You're allowed to make comments but I'm not? Yeah, ok that's fair.""... which would be a fair point if my ""comments"" weren't all related to what's *currently on screen* in *shows he's already seen and I haven't*.

So I got frustrated with the whole ordeal and just quietly switched off the show, did not choose another, and leaned back silently to browse my reddits and breathe. He took this as me being passive aggressive, and started scrolling on his own phone making very loud comments about everything on his feed.

I asked him to stop that as well, and when he chose not to, I asked him to leave. (Funny enough, got a text half an hour later saying he'd cooled off... )

0,"WIBTA if I didn't give the wedding gift at the official gift receiving proccess because I think it's made to shame guests? | I have been friends with the bride for around 10 years, but we stopped talking regularly in the last 3 years when she moved out of the country. Now she's back in her hometown, and we got to catch up right before her wedding, which is set to happen in less than a month. As we are neighbors, and the wedding is happening soon, I have been involved with planning and helping MoH with some details. (I live in the capital city 10months, 2 months in the 'Bride' city.)

&#x200B;

I was talking with the MoH (who I met a few days ago) and she told me she is worried about not being able to handle the alcohol during the gift recieving proccess. Apparently, there is a particular way the gifts are being recieved at the weddings here, and I was shocked to learn about it. Around 3 in the morning, the guests usually form a line at the venue, come up to the MoH and best man one by one, and announce on the mic who is giving what kind of gift to the newelyweds, and then the guest and the MoH or BM take a shot. Thing is, it is tradition to give money in the envelope, and there is not a set amount we are supposed to give, but it's usually around 200-300 euros (from my experience) or more (if the person can afford/wants to give more).

&#x200B;

I asked the MoH if she was sure they had to read the amount of money that is given, and she said yes, and even asked why not when she saw the look on my face. Now, I didn't want to say it was incredibly rude to put your guests on the spot like that, but the more I think about it, the more I'm annoyed. I don't want the amount of money me and my family are gifting to be read in front of 250 people. We are not rich by any means and even though I won't be giving less than the usual amount of money, I still feel it is disrespectful to put anyone on the blast like that. It's our gift for the bride and groom, not a gossip piece for people to talk about later.

&#x200B;

Because my sister is incredibly shy, and only me and her are going to the wedding, I will certainly have to be the one to do the wedding gift proccess. I was wondering if I could simply ask the bride or the MoH to give them the gift before or after, but also I don't want to put more preassure on the bride because she is already stressed out and the MoH seems to like the idea of that kind of gift proccess.

0,"AITA for holding this grudge against my dad from a decade ago | Ten years ago my stepmom accused me of stealing money from my stepbrother. I was 19 at that time, my stepbrother is a month younger. The whole thing was a set up, my stepmom told me it was. She and I had a fight the day before and she told me to just watch what she can do. The next day I got back from work and was met with the accusation that I've stolen thousands of dollars from my stepbrother. My parents kept our money in a lock box in their room with the key hidden. I also had a bank account so I had my own debit card for gas and a little spending money but 90% of my money went into the box. Stepmom claimed thousands of dollars were missing from my stepbrothers money in the lock box. After days of fighting it was determined that there was no proof I stole it but I would be punished anyway. My dad sat me down at the kitchen table to tell me my punishment as my stepmom stood behind him with the biggest smile,dancing and flipping me off. First was that they were cutting off paying for my college. They had already paid for my first and second semester at a community college but they took that money back out of my money. They also took away my debit card and gave me a strict allowance of only gas money to get to work, this included keeping track of my odometer calculating it down to the mile. This was to go on until I moved out which I did about a year later. 
  News was spread around that I was a thief and friends and family distanced themselves, plus I could not go out with no money and being tracked. I was doing well in college but I was not allowed to go back until I moved out and could have control of my own money. There are many reasons I rarely have communicated with my parents the past 10 years but this is one of the bigger ones. My dad has been trying to get me to meet with him and talk things out, mostly because he wants to see his grandaghter. My brothers car broke down so Ive been giving him rides to my parents house. This time I got stuck there talking to my dad. He asked me whats going on with me ignoring him and everything so I tried to talk. First thing I brought up was the situation explained above and my dad and brother laughed out loud at me. Dad said he cant believe I still think about that and that its a long time to hold something agaist him. I told him if we cant even get passed that there's no point talking and left. My brother texted me throughout the night and today trying to get me to come back and talk more, he says 10 years is a long time to hold that against my dad and I should leave it in the past. They say even with what happened its my own fault for not finishing college and moving out. Just thinking about it, 10 years does sound like a long time to hold on to somthing and plenty of people do put themselves through college under worse circumstances. So now im wondering if I am wrong to hold this particular grudge from ten years ago against him.

I invited some friends from my hometown and booked the rooms, since I get a big hotel discount. I worked overtime for 2 weeks and used the extra money as a budget to set aside for my weekend in the city. While we were out, I got a massive bucket drink under the agreement that everyone would venmo me for part of the cost split up equally. My hometown friends were also in agreement that they would pay me back for the room. As the night went on, one friend refused to pay for cover or drinks, and kept trying to tell everyone where she wanted to go and refused to go on my birthday, so I got fed up and told her if she didn’t want to pay for anything and kept throwing a fit about going to where she wanted to go then she could go home, which she did. I paid for the rest of their covers because one of their cards wouldn’t work and the other had to pay a huge service fee for withdrawing, under the agreement I would be paid back with venmo. In total, they owe me about $150, which isn’t a lot to some, but it is to me as a broke grad student, and it blew my budget for going out. 

They refuse to pay me back- one of them agreed to venmo me and then when I mentioned it the next day, she smirked and said she never had venmo and would never download it. The other two are similar. I tried texting and calling them with no response, and when I sent a paragraph a week and a half later, one of them accused me of being heartless for asking her to pay me back while her dog was in the hospital (which she never mentioned to me at all), and then refused to pay me back, saying I would get the money whenever she felt like sending it. The other two want my exact banking info (routing and account number) to pay me back. When I refused and suggested paypal, venmo, or cashapp, they got angry at me and then stopped responding, leading me to think it’s a scam.

As I was walking into the store, there was a lone cart that someone just left. I sped up to it, and rested my hand on the handle. I always like to clean it with a disinfecting wipe that the store has a dispenser of, so I turned my back and walked about 5 feet from my cart to get a wipe.

 I had mentioned to my neighbour across the street that I was going to buy a sofa bed for our office to use for overnight guests.

I ended up selling it for $75.

Neighbour saw my FB ads and she comments on one of the pics saying that if I’m getting rid of the sofa bed she wants it back.

I didn’t respond and then that night she sends me a FB message, “As per my comment, blah blah want the sofa bed back if you are getting rid of it”.

I responded that i no longer needed it so I sold it to recoup some of the cost of the new mattress.

I tell her that it's not my problem, and start walking towards the checkout.

We have photographer friends who offered to do our engagement photos, which we loved and used for our save the dates. We decided to hire a photographer for the wedding, and found one we really liked based on her portfolio. She encouraged us to do an engagement photo shoot (even though we didn't need one). We agreed because it seemed like a good way for her to get to know us before the wedding. The photo shoot itself was... odd. Her co-photographer was there (he'd also be there for the wedding). It turned out they were both \*very\* religious. We are not religious, and it seemed to bother them. They made some uncomfortable comments (we were kissing and he said ""save some of that passion for your wedding night"", or my fiance made a fart joke after they asked us to laugh and she said it was ""really inappropriate to say that in front of your future wife"", while I was laughing). Even given this, it seemed like it was going well (they weren't rude, just odd).

However, when I saw our photos, I was pretty upset. I felt like they went out of their way to make us look awful, and they looked unedited.

I was under a lot of stress at work and didn't want to be a bridezilla, so I took several days to think and showed my photographer friends the photos. They agreed that they seemed unedited and provided specific feedback (they also said there were a lot more ""bad"" pictures than they would expect). I then asked her (using some specifics) if she could re-edit the photos, or refund our deposit so we could find a new photographer. After a few days, she responded with a VERY long email that made me feel pretty bad and included re-edited photos. I must admit they looked better (and my friends agreed).

The clearest one I remember is when we were at a fair at a beach in the middle of summer when I was 8 and my brother was a few months of 7, it was some time in the afternoon we walked passed several booths selling BB guns (realistic looking ones not the obviously fake ones). We were trying to find the food booth to get drinks and a snake, my brother saw the BB guns and immediately declared “I want that” and pointed to the BB that looked like a rifle.

Mums first response was no as was dads, this caused my brother to not only cry but to scream that the top of his lungs in the middle of the street while declaring that our parents are cruel, nasty, selfish, cheap and that he would be better of living with strangers than our parents because then the people he lived with would care about him and love him. My parents stood there for about 5 maybe 10 minutes while this was happening and then my mum chucked her purse at my dad and told him to go buy the BB my brother had pointed at, it was over £40 (I don’t remember the exact price he broke it the same week). We then had to go home immediately and my parents were angry the rest of the day and the rest of the week.

He truly believes that what he wants should come before us being able to keep a roof over our heads.

My parents are seriously worried about his entitled behaviour and how he doesn’t seem able to grasp the concept of working for money or paying bills to live somewhere. They’re now wondering how he could have grown up to behave like this and don’t seem able to see that it could be there fault.

0,"AITA for wanting to return the ""perfect"" gift? | Hi all, this is my first time posting so please bear with me. 

I am a 26M living at home with my parents. My older sister is 30 and my brother-in-law is 34 and they both are not living with us. 

This past Christmas, I received a gift from my older sister and BIL. They kept telling me how this was the ""perfect gift"" for me and how it's the ""best gift ever"" so when it came time to open gifts with my family, I eagerly tore into it. It was a brown, checkered blazer. I like blazers and I like how this blazer looked so I thanked my sister and BIL for the gift. 

That evening, after my sister and BIL left, I tried on the blazer and looked at myself in the mirror. The blazer was too long in the sleeves and too wide in the body. In other words, it did not fit me. I asked my parents for their opinion and my dad agreed that it was too big on me, but my mom said I should just shorten the sleeves and it would be fine. 

I didn't want to keep a blazer that didn't fit me, so I texted my sister telling her I appreciate the gift, but the blazer doesn't fit and asked for the receipt so I can exchange it for a size that fits me better or return it. My sister tells me in an annoyed tone that she has the receipt but I should just get it altered. 

Yesterday, I saw my sister and BIL at another family gathering and they told me how the jacket is worth $300 but they bought it at a department store for $30. They also told me that they went to that department store to look for a blazer for my BIL and found this one but it was too small for him so they decided to give it to me instead. I told them I don't want to spend money on alterations and would instead like to exchange or return it. 

My mom and dad are telling me I should keep it and get it tailored since it's a $300 jacket. My sister and BIL are upset that I want to return it, and said if I did return it, to give them the $30 they spent on it back. I sense that everyone thinks it would be rude of me to return the gift.

0,"AITA For Venting About a Guy | Sorry for the weird title, couldn’t really think of anything better.

Last month during spring break, I was feeling pretty low after my boyfriend broke up with me. I made a tinder just to mess around, and ended up meeting a guy I liked. He seemed pretty cool, had all the same interests and music taste.

His mom took us out to dinner, I had an okay time. Told the guy we’ll call Andrew that his mom made me a little anxious because she was so overbearing. Well, he told her what I said, and made her dislike me. I was upset, but whatever, he apologized and that was that.

Fast forward a little later, I was asking a friend for advice on what to do because I didn’t think I liked him “like that”. I felt bad because he told me how much he liked me and I just didn’t feel the same. After getting his advice I made plans to tell him tomorrow. The mistake that I know I made, and shouldn’t have done, was I let Andrew put his fingerprint in my phone. I was thinking “maybe I should delete these.” And then my second thought was “no, I trust him not to look through my phone.”

Well, he did. He read the messages between my friend and I. While I was sleeping. He left my apartment at 3AM, and drove 45 minutes back to his house. His friends were calling me every name under the sun in the Discord he added me to. His reasoning was he had the right to look through my phone because I let him enter his fingerprint. I’ve learned my lesson with Tinder, at least.

I was served quickly and was sitting eating my food when the owner/manager came over and said, “I’m sorry, we need to close now” (implying I needed to leave). I wasn't even halfway through my food. I checked the time - it was 11:40, so I assumed the internet had been wrong and they really closed at 11:30, so I said, “Oh, sorry, I thought you were open until midnight.” The guy confirmed that they did indeed close at midnight but that they “need\[ed\] to start closing up now.” I argued a bit - asking why I couldn’t just stay for 5 or 10 minutes to eat a bit more and why they couldn’t clean everything but my table while I was finishing and then quickly clean my stuff when I left. But the guy wouldn’t give me any leeway so I ended up leaving having only eaten a bit of the food. I still gave the waiter a 20% tip because it wasn’t his fault.   


All that seems fairly clear-cut I guess, but here’s why I think I may have been (at least a bit of) an asshole: I was the only person in the diner by then and it was a Saturday night, so I can understand that the staff saw an opportunity to get out a little early and enjoy their evening (and I can relate to that having worked customer service in the past). I could also have taken the rest of my food to go, but I have pretty severe OCD (diagnosed by psychiatrist), which makes me very anxious about eating in my apartment (in case I make a mess) so it would not have been an enjoyable experience for me, and I just wanted to enjoy my meal. I guess I could have eaten it outside but again, that’s awkward and not relaxing. So, am I the asshole for wanting to stay and finish my food, even though it would have meant the staff having to hang around for another 20 minutes?",False,False,3,4,1,2,1,3,Fairness

When I was in high school my family was low on money. My parents pulled me aside and told me that they had to cut costs and that I probably wouldn’t get much more than a stocking this year. Being in high school I understood money was tight and they probably wanted to make sure my little brother had a good Christmas. I made one simple request, some new mesh for my lacrosse stick (about $30) they said okay.  Christmas came and everyone had gifts under the tree. We opened the gifts one at a time so my parents could take pictures, explain the gifts, etc. When my older brother opened his and got a PlayStation game I got a little confused but I wrote it off as that being his one big thing. My first gift was a hand me down pair of sunglasses that my dad had been wearing for month. The loop happened again and my older brother opened up a brand new tackle box. The pattern continued with me getting hand me downs and dollar store gags while he got much more expensive things. By the end I was pretty pissed and I yelled at my parents which started an argument prompting me to stay with a friend until after New Years. While I was really pissed at the disparity the thing that really set it off was that they didn’t even get me the one request I had after having spent well over 300-400 on each of my brothers. They later explained that they wanted my older brother to have a memorable Christmas since it was his last one before he turned 18.

To put it simply, I’m exhausted. I’m chasing after two kids all day, while recovering from a C-section, while dealing with a fussy newborn baby. All on my own.

Today I was so tired that I asked my husband if I could order some pizza or Uber some McDonald’s because I didn’t have it in me to cook for everyone for the umpteenth time this week. And tbh I just wanted to enjoy a greasy burger myself. I was expecting him to say yes and was just asking as a courtesy.

Well, he said no. Keep in mind that for the past 2 weeks he’s been posting about his lavish dinners of lobster (which he is paying for btw, not the company!) and all of the alcohol he’s been drinking. He’s basically on a vacation right now. We can definitely afford to spare $10 to get McDonald’s.

On Friday she called me at 3AM to pick her up knowing I had work at 7AM. I still went to get her. She had a friend with her that she didn't tell me about and said they needed a ride home. I agreed even though it was out of my way.

They kept playing music I didn't want to hear the entire time and I asked them to turn it off because it was late and I didn't want to hear it. She started complaining and I told her it was late and I didn't want to hear that music.

I didn't have to pick her up in the first place. Everyone else usually says no, especially this late, and she doesn't even say thank you.

She started saying ""Well I can find my own ride no one told you that you had to."" And saying it wasn't even that late and I told her to remember that next time she needed a ride and she said ""okay"" in a way that just pissed me off. I pulled over and told her to find her own ride if she can do it that easy. 

We sat there for twenty minutes until her friend apologized and asked me to let it go for now and at least get them home. I agreed just because I needed to get back home to get ready for work anyways.

The pay was hourly but we all worked way more hours than we are allowed to report on our time sheets. Minors are only allowed to work 48 hours a week but there is really no time off at camp. The day starts at 7 am and ends at 10 pm. Not to mention if kids wake up in the middle of the night, or pee their beds, then more time. So 15 hour workdays, 7 days a week. 105 hours a week. We're only allowed to report 48 a week, which means only getting paid for 48 a week. 

There is no cell service or access to landlines for us, no internet access, no transportation except cars on or off the camp which is deep in the woods. None of us 16 or 17 year olds had cars. I feel like more people would quit on the spot if they had a way to leave. 

So, onto the drama. Two months into the summer, the camp was having a staffing problem. They'd fired one guy. That guy's three best friends quit on the spot with him. Two international counselors quit soon after. 

I was working at the arts and crafts shed, along with Tom who's 17. We're good friends and I kinda have a crush on him.

One of the girls in our group was the camp owner's daughter, who is really really spoiled, she's used to getting everything she wants if she says ""but Susan's my mom!""

She wanted more craft supplies, and I said no, every child only gets three because we need enough for everyone. She started a screaming crying fit going ""But I want them! My mom's Susan, you have to give me them! you have to!"" It was silly but it was my last straw, and I was like ""Actually I don't have to do anything."" She goes ""Yes you have to, Susan's your boss""

And I go ""Not anymore."" I went to leave and Tom followed me, he said he was done here too. We ran into another counselor with a radio on the path and said they should radio the office to send someone else to the crafts shed, we were quitting.

We packed our duffles and walked away, it took us almost four hours to walk the dirt road out of camp and to the nearest small town, where we went into the dollar store and asked to use a phone because we had no cell reception. His parents were only two hours away so they came to get us that night.

Things apparently got crazy behind us. The counselor we'd told about quitting didn't know who we were so nobody knew who had quit for a while. The camp director was furious at us for having left the children alone, but also furious that we, two minors, had walked off with no ride and no communication with parents. I guess we were in a weird place where we were employed and responsible for children while also legally being children they were responsible for...

They had offered to pay my rent throughout university so I had 10 days to find a new place to live. I ended up sleeping on my friend's sofa. About 6 weeks of no contact later, they called me asking why I hadn't called to wish my mum a happy birthday. I wanted to know if I was TA for not wanting anything to do with them given the way they cut me off. It later came out that the reason they cut me off is that my older brothers told them I'm a lesbian (which... I might be. Still figuring that out. But my brothers didn't know that). I sent my parents proof my brothers lied and they apologised but I've not forgiven them and probably won't ever. I'd applied for emergency housing and a full student finance loan but as I couldn't prove my parents cut me off the services I had to go through said they couldn't help me. I was also looking into a work placement as my course offers them and they pay a decent amount.

So here's how everything has shaped up:

* I won't be getting emergency housing from uni. I've not heard anything and there's less than a month left before summer, so I'd be shocked if I got it at this stage.
* I'm still living with my friend. She got me a job at her workplace but refuses to take any rent off me so I've been repaying her by sneakily buying food and cooking her dinner as I get home before her. We have plans to move in together this summer ready for next year.
* My parents have done a complete 180 and now want me to forgive them so badly that they're still refusing to sign a letter showing they've cut me off, so I'm still fucked with student finance. My parents have also offered me my truck back, so me, my roommate, and 2 more friends will be going to my parents' house some time soon to collect my truck and some things from my room. My tutor has written a letter for me for student finance which they might accept but I'm waiting to hear back.
* My course changes were approved so now I'm doing what I want, not what my parents want, and it looks like I got my work placement, so I'll be either working and studying part time for 2 years or working all next year and finishing studies the year after. Either way I'll be adding an extra year to my course but I get paid and get relevant experience in my field.

Ultimately, everything seems to have worked out as well as it could. Thanks to everyone who commented because a lot of you had great advice and thought of stuff I didn't, and I was truly concerned that I was in the wrong so thanks for the reassurance, too.

0,"AITA for not asking my brother to babysit | Quick backstory

I'm a single mom of an 8 year old. My brother (42) recently separated from his wife after a 20 year marriage and since both of our parents passed away, we are our only family left. So while going through the separation and divorce process, he is renting a room from me in my house.

Now AITA

When he moved in, he was a mess, pretty sad, was blowing off work, wanted to talk a lot etc. he was just really emotional, I think most people get pretty emotional during a marriage breakdown. About a week after he moved in, my ex husband had a major work issue that caused him to not be able to take our son for his scheduled visit that night but would pick up the next morning, this has happened in the past but is rare, maybe about once or twice a year. Of course, my son was really disappointed and cried that he couldn't go to his dad's so I decided to try to make the best of it, I got him a pizza, we watched Ralph Breaks the Internet and let him stay up late. 

Unfortunately, I had plans with my boyfriend so I had to cancel. When I say plans, I was going to go to his house, we were going to make ramen and watch Netflix, so we weren't going to a big event or anything. Just hanging out plans. 

Anyway, I canceled and my boyfriend blew up and told me that my brother was selfish for not offering to babysit and that I should have made him since he's staying here. 

I was miffed because my brother pays rent, he pays for his own food, he's like a roommate and babysitting my son is not his responsibility. Plus, he was pretty emotional and watching my son was a last thing he wanted to do thing. 

I also felt that since his dad was busy with something really important like his job, I felt it was my responsibility to try to a disappointing night into something that would make it a little less disappointing and that includes spending time together.

When I told my boyfriend this, he said that was unfair and that it's obvious that I don't have my shit together because I'm not making him a priority. And that since my brother is staying with me, I should be able to come to his house more because I have ""a live babysitter.""

I'm not giving up"".

Today he texted me and asked if I was upset because he insulted my boyfriend. I said ""I mean it definitely wasn’t cool, but I’m upset about other things as well"". He apologized for the lack of communication and then followed the apology up with ""on the flip side though, you probably could have done a better job communicating what was going on with (boyfriend)  months ago. I think you were a little naive/unrealistic about what was happening"". I explained to him that my boyfriend and I only started dating in January and that I told him about my boyfriend multiple times. I also said that I had zero idea that he was attracted to me. The final text he sent me was ""Oh wow. Literally everyone in (Dorm Hall) knew I had feelings for you, I assumed you did too. My bad. I guess I took things wayyy too slow. It’s too bad because we have damn good chemistry"".

1,"AITA for insulting my friends lazy eye? | I have a strong friendship group which hasn’t changed in years. I (18) sometimes can be overly harsh by saying what I think about people before assessing if it’s worth saying.

Anyway, recently another person has been involved in our friendship group, the majority of the group dislike this person due to his annoying and constant lies about anything and everything. We only allow him to be with us as one person of the group is good friends with him and don’t want to upset him.

So one night we are all talking joking about and he says (me) is such a dumb cunt, everyone kinda freezes and goes silent. He then says omg (me) honestly boils my blood by how annoying they are, I honestly fucking hate (me). I quite astonished and at the time seeing his lazy eye looking the wrong way say “at least I don’t have googly eyes.” Everyone gasped and he walks away and blocks me on every social media.

Half of my friends say it was uncalled for but I said if he calls me a name I’m going to say something back. They said due to it being personal to him I took it too far and should apologise.

We split the housework roughly 60/40, which me doing more of the housework. I do a heavy clean every other week. She rarely cleans, besides cleaning up after herself. Maybe once per season she will do some (but not all) cleaning in the bathroom. But besides that she never touches the bathroom or the kitchen. She also rarely vacuums even though 60% of the stuff we vaccuum up is either her hair, her cat's hair or cat's litter.

She does do the laundry (more on that later). I do most of the cooking. On my days off this also means I do the dishes. She does dishes 1-2 days per week.

Laundry: She does the laundry because she's particular about how she likes it done. Not because I don't know how to do it. I'm an old school dude. I use laundry detergent, bleach and water. I've done my laundry since I was a teenager and I've always had nice, clean clothes. She also cleans some stuff way too often, for instance the sheets. She also likes dumping in all these products to make the laundry smell scented. She just likes the clothes to smell like weird fruity scents. I don't. I like my clothes to smell like nice, clean clothes. But whatever, pick your battles, don't die on random hills, you get the drill.

I've asked her to clean more because she has an extra 450+ minutes per week than I do because she works right next to home. She did this for a week and then basically fell back into her old habits. She feels that since I have an extra day off, per week than she does, it means I have more time to clean. I told her we literally work the same amount of hours, I just spend an extra 7 hours or so per week on the bus.

0,"AITA for not accommodating to a church's parking request? | So I (24M) live in an apartment complex in downtown of the city I live in. The city isn't too packed but downtown is the worst and particularly on my street. I pay $25/month to park on any green meter space and my street is lined up with them. Parking is usually charged by the hour but I bypass that with the $25/month parking permit I have. On my street, right next door to the complex I live in, is a church. On Sundays, they have permission from the city for church-goers to park diagonal on a street that is usually for parallel parking (lined with green meters). To be honest, it's not a huge deal and does not cause much traffic and it's only for the portion of the street the church is on. 

Here is where a problem arose. This past Saturday I came home late and there were no spots in front of my complex. It's no biggie, I just parked 20 feet away in front of the church on one of the green meter spaces that I am allowed to park on. Not only because I pay monthly, but it's also free on weekends so even if I didn't pay monthly, I'd be allowed. The next morning I go to my car around 11am and there's a bunch of church folk leaving and I notice a letter on my car. It was from the church, strongly-worded, and basically said the city granted permission for people to park diagonally in these spots from 7am - 12:30pm and that I have caused a huge inconvenience and to be more respectful next time. For specifics, the letter said that *if* I am parking in front of the church to between 7am - 12:30pm, to please accommodate and park diagonally. Nowhere stated it was mandatory.

They left a number to call and I did. I apologized for the inconvenience, told them I lived in the complex next door, and if I can get towed if I park like that again. The guy on the phone who is the Director of Ops for the church, said they can't tow, the spots are still owned by the city, but they have permission to park diagonally for those certain times. I said fair enough, however, I parked there around 11pm last night which means I was not subject to the diagonal parking rule as it's only allowed from 7am - 12:30pm. The guy told me that to avoid further inconvenience to the church, that I fix my parking around 7am, if I am forced to park in front of their church again.

I laughed. I explained that I am not going to inconvenience myself on the one day a week I can sleep in to accommodate to your church guests. I explained I pay for a permit to park in these green spots and that since they are still owned by the city, I am well within my rights to park there and since I didn't park between 7am - 12:30pm, I'm not subject to accommodate. If I parked diagonally any other time, I would be ticketed. 

He continued to pester, I told him the conclusion is that if between those hours on Sunday, I will accommodate, however, if I am forced to park there on a Saturday night, I will not get up to accommodate. I said take it or leave it and hung up.

My (19F) Mom (52F) has this incredibly annoying habit of eating my leftovers without asking. Now, this might not seem like a huge deal, it kind of is for me because I work part time and only make minimum wage (I've tried looking for a better job, but so far no luck) so the times that I get to eat out are fairly rare. I also tend to order quite a lot of food when I do eat out, with the intention of getting multiple meals out of it. However, my Mom seems to take that as an open invitation to eat them. The last straw was when I came home from work to discover that she had finished off my leftover Arby's sandwich which I had been planning on taking to work the next day. I feel like buying myself a mini fridge and putting it in my room would be the best option to stop her from eating my food, because I feel like if its on the second floor and not in the main floor kitchen, she won't feel like getting it.

Now, here's where I feel like I might be a bit of an asshole. I'm currently living with my parents rent free. I've offered numerous times to at least pay for groceries or some utilities, but each time they've refused under the reasoning that I should be saving my money (which I've been doing). While its annoying that my Mom feels entitled to my leftovers, I also feel like it might be kind of shitty of me to not share my food since neither of my parents expect me to contribute to the household financially.

0,"AITA for not changing my ceremony time for my grandma | I (27 F) got engaged late December 2019. My grandma had called me and asked that I not book my wedding between a couple dates - one early 2020 and one end of July 2020. I told her I don’t think I’ll be planning it for either of those times. 

Side note: my mother told me to not worry about planning around my grandma. That I should have my wedding whenever it suits me. But I do want my grandma at my wedding. 

Fast forward to last week. We have viewed several venues, most of which are booked up in 2020 and even some into 2021. We found a place I love and decided on August 1st date. The had a couple other openings in August but this date would not conflict with some unknown travel dates of my fiancé. 

Today my grandma called saying how sad she was that we booked August 1st, as that is the date they will be porting from their cruise. She didn’t say what time, but she looked at flights and was worried she would not make it to the ceremony. 

Per the venue, a typical ceremony is around 5:30-6pm. The flight my grandma found would arrive around 4:30, and takes maybe an hour to get to the venue from airport. 

She asked me to move my ceremony start time back to 6:30. I didn’t outright say no, but I think that’s too late for a ceremony to start. 

I asked her about canceling her cruise. (Note she goes on several cruises every year). She told me it’s a “once in a lifetime” trip and she didn’t want to miss it since she’s getting old. I kindly told her that my wedding is also once in a lifetime and that if she couldn’t find a suitable flight, she would have to choose. I even offered to help her find flights. The flights are limited, I’ll admit. And not knowing what time her cruise boards, it’s hard to help. There was one flight that would work, but it would be tight timing.

I feel awful for choosing a wedding date that conflicts with her plans, but we were limited on dates/venues. She also told me not to do the wedding at the end of July. I don’t remember if she gave me exact dates.

One of the influencers has asked me to pay 100% up front ($263 USD) right now. The only problem is, I’ve never met this guy. He’s an internet stranger who lives in Serbia and for all I know, he could steal my money and run. 

Also, I made the mistake of paying an influencer $750, all in advance. He disappeared for a month and was unresponsive to my emails. It wasn’t until I threatened to sue him that he grudgingly responded and asked me why I’m so stressed out. He said he couldn’t respond because he’s too busy, but funny enough he was quick to respond before he got my money. 

So I said to the Serbian influencer, I’ll pay you half up front and the other half after you post my links. He responds and says that “I’m not like other influencers” and he demanded the full payment right now. I hate arguments and I’m not a confrontational person, so I replied and said that I’d pay him the full amount in advance. 

After thinking about it all night last night, I wrote an email to the Serbian influencer explaining the bad experience I had with the other influencer and how I wasn’t comfortable with paying 100% up front.

I went vegan just this year but I'd been making vegan desserts/dishes for a while then because it helped make it a bit easier for me to avoid dairy. 

My mother was hosting (Canadian) thanksgiving this year. She asked me to make a couple side dishes and dessert - no one else in my family really likes to/can bake, and they like my vegan desserts just fine. I made the same dessert I'd made last year that we all liked - a vegan pumpkin pie. I made it really early this morning because it had to chill and set in the fridge for a good few hours. I carefully wrapped it up and stuck it at the bottom of the fridge behind a couple things so it wouldn't get knocked off. 

I'm not exactly sure how or why it happened, but my brother (30) went to get something out of the fridge and pulled out the pie to get at it and put it on the counter. He ended up knocking it off the counter and the pie plate broke and the pie was ruined. He went to the store and bought a store bought pumpkin pie.

We don't have any living room which restricts me socialising as much as I desire. That is the main reason I wanted to move out initially.

Since I moved here, I requested from landlord to change just the bath as it was rusty and you can't clean it as more you try to clean more rusty it gets. Couple of months ago he called me on a Sunday saying, he is refurbishing the toilet and the bathroom whole together. It was nice of him to do some investment in the flat which  let's his tenants to have humane environment.

It was the last drop. I had been looking for flats for couple of months and just before the lock down I found a decent room which is smaller but have a living room and a small garden just 20 pounds more than I am paying now and since I got an increase on my wages I can afford it.

During this time I've had roommates rotating in and out to help afford rent. The latest roommates are a couple, Dan (24M) and Jess (25F).

A few months ago they announced that Jess was pregnant and due in a couple of months!!! I was really surprised because, I feel mean saying this, she wasn't showing very visibly through her body shape. I congratulated them but when I asked what their plans were for their future family home they said they were hoping that I would move out. I said that goes against my plans that I've had for years and that I was planning on staying here. They insisted that I would ""have"" to move out as they're a new family now and need space. I told them that was great and I respect that need but if they wanted space they would need to find a new place as I was here first.

Shit got pretty cold from there. We haven't really talked much, until now. They had the baby and it's now about a month old. I knew I'd have to bunker down a bit so I took all of my things from the common area (TV, consoles, kitchenware, etc) and with some work I got a pretty nice compact setup in my room with some DIY soundproofing and a makeshift kitchenette so I can ignore the baby's crying. They used my stuff previously and were not happy at all and had to beg on facebook until someone got them new dishes, making sure to shit talk me in all the posts which I thought was pretty rude but whatever.

Because I found out so late about the pregnancy, we're still on the lease for a good 6 months. They want me to break the lease so they can focus on their family. I told them that as I said before this wasn't going to happen. Either they break the lease or they put up with me living my life the way I want to, which includes having people over, listening to music, smoking weed (legal state), drinking, etc. They said they can't afford to break the lease. I said that's unfortunate but neither can I. They said it would be easier for me because I'm not a parent and that I would just need to scrimp a little bit so I can afford to pay two rents. I said maybe but I'm not going to hamstring my lifestyle because they chose to inconvenience everyone around them with their kid. I was admittedly kind of the AH for saying this but I was being harassed.

We were rear-ended on the highway because traffic was slowing down rapidly due to construction. It was the other person's fault, they admitted that to the officer. After the accident, my neck was very tight and I was considering going to the doctor over the next few days if the pain didn't go away. My sister calls to make a claim and I made sure to have her let the insurance agent know that I was having neck pain. My sister told me that her neck hurt too, but not as bad as mine did.

Now, a few days later, I get a call from the other person's insurance company asking for details. I told them that my neck is better, I'm just a little sore. They offered a decent amount as a settlement, although not a large amount (I don't think the actual dollar value is relevant). I figured I should accept because I'm feeling much better and the soreness is almost gone. So we proceeded with that. I then let my sister know about their settlement offer because I was going to see if they offered her one as well. Turns out she didn't let them know that she was hurt, because she didn't think it was too serious.

Now she thinks that she should get some of the money they offered me because she was in the accident as well. She said that it wasn't fair for me to make money off of her misfortune, so I should pay her some of the money. However, I don't think that she is entitled to the settlement money because she chose not to make a claim.

The wedding invite explicitly stated (in a terrible bit of prose) that they expect cash as a gift, as they have ""everything"" else they need.

This has really rubbed me the wrong way because the wedding is already costing us cold hard cash. 

$400 on bridal party attire (as stipulated by the couple)
$100 on the bachelor party
1.5 days of vacation days for me (because the wedding and rehearsal are midweek during 9-5 work hours)
4 hours missed work for my husband

My partner and I just made a baby. Our baby is a beautiful blend of us, she's healthy, and she's easily consolable as long as you pay attention to her needs. I feel very lucky to have such a chill baby. This is our first kid so I'm learning to be a dad and she is learning how to be a mom. 

Im not a fan of documenting every moment of my life,  I prefer to just live it. I have a stoic demeanor and tend to be extremely mindful about things being impermanent. I was a very reactive young man and as I grow older being slower to react has been the lynchpin to my ability to cultivate close romantic relationships. 

We all have our dispositions and tendencies. This is mine. My partner has another.

My partner loves to take pictures of everything she experiences. Her Instagram story is basically a play by play of every meal she makes and every experience she encounters. Our baby has been hot content for her lately.

I don't like that our baby is social media content for her, but if she feels rewarded posting pics about our baby 24/7 so be it. My only ask is that she leave moments with me and baby out of it. The first 3 weeks she did not follow my boundary and from time to time I would find myself on her social media sharing a candid moment with our daughter. I let it slide because whatever were new parents, but I continues to reiterate that I would.rather not be content in her social media world.

Yesterday as I'm walking around the house feeding baby I turn around and see her recording me. I understand that she thinks this is a sweet moment to share with social media but for me this is a private moment I'm having with my family that I don't want to be shared. Im learning how to be a dad and I feel vulnerable enough as it is without having my moments be turned into content for my partner. 

I snapped and told my partner ""please stop fuc*ing posting pictures of me and baby"". I immediately regretted the reaction but I felt like all of my other polite requests were ignored and I reacted in a harsh way.

0,"WIBTA for not letting my brother-in-law go on vacation with us. | warning: wall of text. Lots of backstory. 

Several years ago my wife and I had a destination wedding in another state. Her whole family went. Her parents are divorced and the older of the two brothers lived with his mom.(this is the brother in question) Because they didn't have a lot of money they road with us in the car and took a bus home at the end of the week. (We stayed a second week by ourselves for a honeymoon). 

Her mom talks about that trip all the time. she said it was one of the best trip she ever took in her whole life. she talks about how much she loved to go back there someday. 

so this year for Christmas we decided to surprise her with a suitcase and a letter saying basically that we were taking her back there this summer. Because my wife sister is older and married now they will be going also. 

A few days ago I find out that the brother somehow thinks that he was invited to and that he's going on vacation with us. My wife doesn't really care so long as he pays his own way. 

Here's the problem though. This brother is like the most socially inept person I've ever met. He never learn to be an adult and is just a complete embarrassment to be around in public. He has this really annoying need for constant attention. If people are talking about things that he doesn't know about or have any experience with, he will just start making stuff up. He makes up insanely unbelievable stories about things he's done or seen that anybody would know is not true. And when you're talkin about things he will try to correct you and tell you you're wrong and then make up lies to support it. 

Ex: someone asked if Dr pepper is made by Coke or Pepsi. I explained the doctor pepper is its own company and not made by either. He chimes in that dr. Pepper is actually made by Coke but Coke keeps it a secret. I told him that's ridiculous. He tells me that his friend's dad is the CFO for Coca-Cola and told him that they make Dr pepper. 

It causes a lot of stress in the group. He will start trying to cut me down and tell lies. I will call him on his lies and expose him. Then he will get mad and pout and everyone will get mad at me for being mean to him. 

so anyway I find out that he thinks he's going on this vacation. I told my wife no way. If he's going I'm not going. We have going on a week-long trip with him before and it was a nightmare. everyone was mad at me the whole time for arguing with him. They think I should just let it go and let him lie. 

Part of me realizes that since I'm the only one that has a problem with him, I should bow out. But my wife and I are the ones that planned this trip.

I said sure because I genuinely thought they were nice and wanted them (but also didn't want her to waste all her time). I got the shoes from her but didn’t pay yet and when I went home I found out she got them a size down. Stacey suddenly wants the shoes back after I say I could make a profit of off them because she went through all the trouble of buying them so she wants to resell them herself. I don't see why I should because they’re technically mine and even offered money for the trouble of lining up. Ended up having huge argument where she accused me of taking advantage of her and that if I give her money instead of the shoes we were done being friends.

Because of that, we were estranged.

Two sisters live in Florida, and when I was 20 (four and a half years ago) my dad started rekindling his relationship with the them. To show support for that, I did as well. I never felt comfortable, because of the history, but I tried my best to be as sisterly as an only child could be.

Last summer our father died. Before the wake even happened, my sisters, brother and I went to dinner and other than “hello,” the first thing my oldest sister said to me was: “his money should be split between the five of us.” That rubbed me the wrong way but I moved forward because I thought that dad would be excited to see all of his kids together getting along.

About a month, maybe two months, after he was buried (September/October), this same sister posted on Facebook about how her ex husband wasn’t treating all of his kids equally, and she went on to rant about how her “biological father” treated only one of his kids well and ignored the rest. I have proof of letters, cards, etc he sent them asking to see them/talk to them that they blatantly ignored (they were adults when I was born). She continued to rant and just talked a lot of crap about my dad which really upset me for a few reasons: 1, as I just stated he didn’t throw them away, and 2, he wasn’t there to be able to defend himself against her nasty words; he was the best dad. 

That night, I made the choice to cut off ties with all of my siblings for good. I was tired of getting upset about their BS constantly. Shortly after this, the same sister emailed my mother stating that she believes my mom is entitled to ZERO of my father’s life insurance money/unpaid salary/etc because they divorced and that money should be split among his five children. My dad did not have a will, but his job informed us it was all left to my mom in trust for me. I initially wanted to send all four of my siblings some of the money, but that left a very sour taste in my mouth after my mom had set up all of the funerary arrangements so they didn’t have to.

0,"AITA For disowning my cousin (who's also my wife's best friend) |   

My cousin decided to marry her boyfriend of 2 years (they were both 21 at the time.) I became good friends with him and continue to be today. He was deployed overseas after being married for almost a year (Army.) Fast-forward nearly another year. He returns from overseas to discover she wants a divorce and on top of that had been cheating on him while he was deployed. They get divorced and she moves in with her parents. A mere few months later she is pregnant by the guy she cheated with. He immediately ditches her and the baby, leaving her to raise it alone.

My cousin and I are very different despite being close as kids. We didn't hang out much but I harbored no ill will until she cheated on her spouse who is a close friend to me. I was upset but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. ""People make mistakes"" I thought.

Fast-forward 18 months. Cousin gives birth to the baby and is living with my grandparents. They are getting on in years and they noticed their memories are not what they used to be (History of Alzheimer's in the family.) They decide to talk to their lawyer to check their affairs are in order because they are unsure how many years of being sound of mind they have left (Keep in mind right now they are still fine.)

Cousin takes grandparents to lawyer’s office. Cousin gets in her head (don't ask because I don't have an answer) that they are going to sign over to her sole power of attorney and management of their finances in preparation of them being unable to make such decisions in the future. The lawyer immediately shoots it down stating the following:

""That is premature as well as a poor choice of guardianship as the grandparents have two perfectly capable sons in their early 50's.""

Giving a 20-something single mom with no job and hardly any work experience that responsibility and power is a bad move.

She gets up on his desk screaming at him he has no right,etc. Lawyer asks her to cease at once or he will call the police. She doesn't. He gets on the phone to dial 911. She explodes out of the room and speeds off, leaving my grandparents stranded. The lawyer apologizes and pays for my grandparents to get a ride home.

Cousin is also best friends with my wife. They would hang out all the time and my wife really enjoys spending time with her little one. For me though, it was the last straw.

My husband and I still maintain separate bank accounts, while having 1 joint account for bills that we both put money into every pay, and 1 joint savings account.  We both put money into RRSP's, however his employer matches his RRSP contributions up to a certain amount every pay and his RRSP contributions are automatically taken out by his employer.  This also means that his employer does not tax him on his pay for the amount equal to his RRSP contributions.  Come tax time, he is usually more or less squared up even for taxes.  Myself, on the other hand, have to pay into my own RRSP account that my employer does not match.  This also means that I am taxed on my RRSP contributions and I get this tax money back as a tax return every year.

She said without the house that I am looking at, they will have to take out loans to afford an actual apartment. I said no because I have been putting in all this work to find the house, and while I do make more money than them on paper, in reality, I have other expenses that sop up that extra money (student loans, auto loan, savings goals etc).

We used to split chores 50/50 apart from cooking which I do every night since he has never learnt how to cook. He started making remarks that I should pick up some of his chores because I'm reading a book while he's still reviewing a lecture. The way I see it is we both have the same work load I just handle it more effectively and already cook on top of doing my 50%. I shouldn't be punished for studying effectively. If it were occasionally when he has an assignment due I wouldn't mind but I don't want this to be the new normal.

1,"AITA for inviting ex-husband but not his young fiance to my wedding? | \*All names have been changed

My ex-husband Richard (33, M) and I (36, F) were together for about eight years and were married for three of those eight years. However, after we were married it became clear that we just weren’t right for each other and ended up getting a divorce four years ago. Luckily, everything went relatively smoothly and we are still on good terms and are still in contact. Richard has been such a big part of my life for so long and since we are still friends, I want him to be at my wedding in October. My fiancé Ben (38, M) is completely fine with this. However, I am not comfortable with Richard’s fiancé Claire (22, F) attending the wedding. I don’t know her very well as I have only met her twice and I don’t want a someone who is basically stranger at my wedding. Besides Claire’s always been standoffish around me despite my attempts to be friendly with her, and the majority of the people at the wedding will be adults who are at the youngest in their thirties so I think it would be weird to invite someone who is still basically a teenager. 

The invitations I sent out do not have a plus one option on them. If I’m inviting a couple then they both get their own invitations to avoid confusion. After I sent the invitations out, I got a call from Richard mentioning there being no plus one option and that he wanted to bring Claire with him. I politely informed him that she was not invited and explained my reasoning to him. He did not take this well. Richard told me that he was only going to go if he could bring Claire with him. I again informed him that Claire was not invited to my wedding. He hung up after telling me he wouldn’t be going then. I tried to call him a few more times to smooth things over, but only got his voicemail. Ben and my friends say that I should just invite Claire or that I just shouldn’t have invited him in the first place. I disagree- I think that since Richard and I have always been so close that he deserves to be at my wedding. I don’t know Claire and I don’t want Richard’s little arm candy at my wedding. If the scenario was flipped and Richard asked me to come but not bring Ben then I would go and respect this. On top of that, I heard through mutual friends that Claire has mentioned that I am “harassing” Richard and her by calling them. I’m planning on mentioning this to Richard when I next speak with him as reason as to why I don’t want her there. I don’t think that I’m being unreasonable but everyone else thinks I am.

This might be a little petty, but i’ve been feeling genuinely uncomfortable with this thought. 

so, for my art project, i’ve had to make 30 little 5x5 centimetre drawings. i’ve been doing them on my kitchen on the dining table because my laptop is usually there and i find the lighting there best for small details. 

my mom has been doing her work from home also on the dining room table, so she’ll see me do my work and sometimes step in to help if i’m stuck with anything. she’s asked to take a picture, just so she can show her friend, but i told her i didn’t want my art to be seen by her friends, mostly because she’s shared a lot of my personal experiences and pictures to her facebook or instagram (which both have over 5k people looking at, i’m on instagram and facebook, but i never check them). 

so i told her no, and she complained a little bit about how she just wants to show her friends, but i knew she’d end up posting them somewhere else. but me being the idiot that i am, i left the little squares on the table, because i was afraid i’d loose them if i bring them up to my room for the night. 

well, the next day i find on my moms facebook, a picture of all the drawing i did, that she took without my permission and didn’t even put my name or watermark on any of them. i only found out because she opened her facebook in front of me. 

i told her to take them down, as this wasn’t the first time she’s done something like this, but she told me that as she is my mother, i don’t have privacy and she should be allowed to show the work of her child. 

i don’t want to confront her, because i’ve tried in the past to do this, but she would never take me seriously or she’ll just say that she’s my mother and she can share whatever i do to her friends. WIBTA if i really confront her?

In the lecture hall the seats are kind of in levels similar to a movie theaters and the guy behind where I sit always has his feet resting on the seat in front of him. (Where his feet rest on the seat is pretty level to the floor, so he’s basically just stretching all the way out)

0,"AITA for not paying my aunt's phone bill? | For most of my life, my aunt has a difficult time listening to me.If I'm upset about how she's talking to me and voice it, she brushes it off and says I'm being too sensitive. If I'm telling a story, she'll interrupt and ask something that had already been said.

If I tell her not to give bad foods to the dogs, she'll go ahead and do it behind my back. My mom has had 4 strokes in the last 6 years, and I've been trying to get her to eat healthy. Every 6 months is a conversation about not buying french fries, soda, etc. Just recently, my mom had a check up where her cholesterol was through the roof, and I had a conversation again about not buying all that crap. When I confront my aunt about it, she says that ""it's only one time"". It stops for a while, and then it continues. She also listens to other people before me, even though I've backed up my POV with facts and sources.

Sunday was my mom's birthday, and I told my aunt a week before to buy a vanilla cake from a specific store because my mom likes their vanilla cakes. I also tell her not to buy bad food. She agrees. Sunday comes and she calls me from a another store asking what flavor. I say vanilla, but that isn't the store I told her to go to. She says that she had plans for today and she wasn't going to go out of her way to go to some other store to get a cake I respond by saying that I had told her a week ago and that she said agreed to it, and her response was that I'm overreacting.

When she came home, she has the cake, along with a bag of french fries and soda. I ask her about it. She says that it's only for her birthday, and I say that that's why the cake was allowed. Plus, I had asked her not to buy other crap, She waves me off. 

Later on, after we've sang happy birthday, I see my aunt sneakily giving my dog cake, using her body to block my view. I tell her that she's going to kill my dog. And she says that I'm just overreacting. I just went to my room, and slammed the door closed.

Every time she doesn't listen to me, it gets increasingly worse. It went from being civil, to me making petty and shady comments, to just screaming and now slamming things. 

So I decided to no longer give her money. Monday, my mom and aunt were talking about my aunt's phone service. It had been cut off because she didn't pay the $80. Today, while I'm at work and more inclined to say yes to things because I don't want attention, my mom calls. She asks if I can pay for my aunt's phone bill, and I say no. When I tried to explain to her why, my mom interrupts me and starts saying that she was my aunt and family. I tell her that I'm trying to say why and she's not letting me. My mom ignores it and asks if I was going to pay for the bill, and I say no. She said thank you and hung up on me.

**TL;DR**: I don't want to pay for my aunt's phone bill because I feel like she's not treating me with enough respect to value how I feel and think.

0,"AITA for demanding a rescue take a foster dog back? | I volunteered for a shelter-less dog and cat rescue (read: animals were rescued and cared for entirely by foster parents, there was no central structure to house them in).   I’m an experienced foster parent and took on a 3 year old male dog as a foster but told them I couldn’t keep him through the holidays because I travel with my resident dog. I pay for food, train at home with him, and shuttle him to and from all of the rescue’s adoption events and potential meet and greets. The rescue spends most of its time advertising the puppies and cats they have up for adoption but rarely post about my guy (and, because this rescue is shelter-less, social media is really the only way people hear about their adoptive dogs). As time goes by, the foster dog has more and more behavioral issues (crate breaking, marking, general destruction), and I ask that the rescue find somewhere else to place him. They tell me that all of their foster homes are full. I take my foster to obedience classes that I pay for, put tons of time into working with him, but things don’t get much better and he’s a constant source of stress. 
Fast forward to early December when the rescue posts on social media congratulating themselves/thanking people because all but one of their animals (my foster) has been adopted out. I call pissed off and demand that they place my foster elsewhere, since all of their other foster homes are obviously open. They tell me again that no one else can take my guy but that “they’re working on it”. I’ve had this dog for six months now and the holidays are two weeks away. I tell them that if they don’t find a place for him by the end of the week I will leave him tied to the railing of the rescue coordinator’s house (empty threat, but they didn’t know that).  Magically by the end of the week, they find an adopter for him, and tell me they will no longer use me as a foster parent and cut all ties. Suffice to say I wasn’t interested in working with them anymore either. 
AITA, because I no longer wanted to devote my time and money to a volunteer position that wasn’t working out and that could have been resolved if the rescue was doing their job, advertising the dog and placing him elsewhere if his current placement wasn’t working out?

Both very excited about ‘our house’ and,living in an ‘all girl house’ however a week before we moved in together she got a boyfriend who just never leaves, he is very at home here, having baths etc. 

Last night I told them, in the nicest possible way, that it is nothing personal against her boyfriend, but I don’t want to live with a couple.

She threw what can only be described as a tantrum. Full on Romeo and Juliet type dramatics. Saying words to the effect of ‘ I pay half the rent, I should be able to have people over whenever I like’ ‘why don’t you want me to be happy?’ ‘Why do you want us to break up?’ I wouldn’t care if it was the other way round’ ‘him living here has no affect on you why do you care.?’ And other things.

I didn’t ask her to do anything, I didn’t ask her to break up with him, I specifically have not asked her to do anything, I just told them I don’t want to live with a couple, In the  hope that she would see where I was coming from and we could discuss a solution moving forwards. So these are words she is putting into my mouth. 

Her boyfriend owns a car and lives half an hour away. Our house is a lot closer to their work (they work together) and he lives with his mum, she has been to his house before, met the family and so on.

This house is more expensive than we would have both liked, we figured it would be worth it as it is a place that is ‘ours’. 

He hasn’t offered to chip in with rent or bills, but even if he did, I wouldn’t want him to, I’d rather just not live with him. I’d rather live in a house were I can roam about in my underwear and spend time with my friend.

As such, I take her bins out for her. Not a big issue as I have to use the same passageway to take mine out anyway and she has always been a good neighbour.

Around 2 years ago, her kids all chipped in and got her a mobillity scooter. They had spoken to her before hand but she said she did not want one as she would not use it. They went ahead and got it anyway. 2 years later and she has still yet to use it.

The issue is, it is parked in our shared passage way as there is nowhere else for it. The passege way is too narrow to allow her to keep it in the garden (would not be able to turn it to get through the back door) so there it has sat for 2 years.

Every time I need to take the bins out or use the passage way for anything really, I have to move this damn scooter, there is no light in the passage way and I have lost count of the number of times I have ran over my own foot moving the damn this out of the way.

If she used it then I would have no issue but all it has ever done since she got it is gather dust and be an inconvenience to me.

0,"AiTA for not trusting a delivery driver? | Today I ordered food off of an app- it's a third party delivery service that picks up the food and delivers your order. Once you pay online, you're given a code that you give to the delivery driver once he gives you your food (I assume that's how the drivers get paid). The app generates a time that you can expect to get your food by, and the drivers are expected to complete the delivery by then, so if you don't get your order by the promised time you often get a percentage of your order cost refunded. Drivers are not limited in how many orders they can pick up simultaneously (they use their discretion to pick up the tickets they want), but if they take too many at once, they will exceed the time limit and most likely suffer a penalty.

&#x200B;

I had ordered one tea and 2 pastries, for which I only received one. I called the shop and the manager was very apologetic, offering to using the service to send me out the missing pastry ASAP. I had assumed they would just refund me through the app, but that solution was fine too. The shop paid the delivery fee, and I was given the code to give to the driver when my order arrived. About twenty minutes later, the driver called me to ask for the code, stating he was on his way. I thanked him for letting me know he was coming and hung up, to which he called back two minutes later asking for the code again. I replied that I would have it for him the minute he arrived. After another two minutes, he called back again telling me he was nearby and he was running out of time, could he have the code? I told him he would get the code when I got my food. This time I was a bit annoyed, as he knows the rules as a driver and the only way I can guarantee that my food will be delivered is to hold onto the code until my food is here. The guy snapped at me: do you not understand the code is about to expire?! And I retorted back: Well, you better hurry then, right? as nicely as possible before hanging up. I didn't want to argue any longer, but I wasn't about to risk not getting my item by giving up the code. My friend told me that I was being selfish and unkind since the guy might not get paid for the delivery. I argued that since he voluntarily picked up the ticket, he shouldn't have taken ones he couldn't deliver on time. He said something to the effect of, ""thank goodness the world isn't full of unkind bitches like you"".

I attended the first day of class but it was packed so I had to stand in the back.  Then I missed the Friday lecture as well as the Monday lecture.  Today, Wednesday, was my 1st day back. I knew the class was packed so I came 10 min early to get a seat in the front row.  I prefer to sit in the front row because I have anxiety.  By sitting in the front I'm able to ask questions/answer questions without being forced to shout it across the room.  I'm perfectly capable of doing well in a course if I'm forced to sit in the back...this is just a strong preference.

All seats are first come, first served.

You have to notify the school, then the professor makes sure that seat is available to you every lecture.

Girl 1: Yeah but I've been sitting in this seat all semester (this is our 3rd lecture out of like 30). There are still open seats in the back that you can move to.

0,"AITA for not wanting to drive my girlfriends roommate to work in the morning? | Hey everyone, first post here and looking for advice. 

My girlfriend had a girls night planned for her friends birthday and she invited me to come out as well. We went to a few bars and everyone was pretty drunk after a couple of hours. I started drinking water to sober up and drive home while everyone else kept drinking. One bar closed so we all moved to the next and by now the loud music and large crowds are starting to get on my nerves. Finally everyone decides to leave but no one is able to drive. I told the GF we can take her roommate back to their place but I needed to go home and take care of the dogs afterwards. I guess some words got mixed up because now She’s upset that I didn’t want to wake up in 5 hours to drive her roommate back to work since she left her car at the bars: I told her that her roommate needs to be more responsible when going out if she has to work the next day and that she can Uber (it would cost $20).

Just because people are going to ask, we both have full-time jobs and I make more than he does (by quite a bit).
 
Recently, there was some severe water damage to that rental property and it needs quite a bit of construction to fix the damage. He wants to use some of our marital savings to pay for the construction. I said absolutely not; it’s his property so he needs to pay for it with his own personal savings. He didn’t like that and argued that since we are married we are a team so we need to conquer this together. 

I do not agree. If our marital house had this same damage, I wouldn’t think twice about using marital funds but don’t think it’s fair to use them on his property. He made it perfectly clear that the property was not marital property so I have a huge issue in spending marital funds on that property. I argue that I receive no benefit by putting my money into his property (I will never see a return nor receive my money back) so I will not allow the expense. I’ve instead offered to loan him money (interest-free) via a contract with structured repayment period but he won’t agree to that as “I’m making it more complicated that it needs to be”.

1,"AITA for being salty about a wedding gift and insisting we share it? | My wife and I are both very musical people. I work in a studio for recording musicians and my wife is a music teacher. I play violin and nylon string guitar, she plays electric guitar.

We have separate finances and assets. It's a conscientious choice because our incomes are similar enough and we have about the same worth of valuables, we'd rather keeps things in our own names rather than joint ownership of it all. In case of separation, it's clear cut basically and avoids the headache. At least this is how we mutually justify it.

In our culture, it's appropriate to surprise your spouse with an expensive gift on the wedding day. We decided among ourselves to have a $1000 limit. I think we both had the same idea of something musical related.

My gift to her? A year in advance I ordered a ""Fender Custom Shop"" guitar made to her favorite specifications. I went overboard, way overboard, and spent around $4000. Maybe many of you are out of the loop but this is artisan built one-off quality, made by people at literally the ceiling of their occupation.

Her gift to me? Some new rosin. Bought off the shelf at my local music store with the pricetag still on the box. $12.99. I thought it was a joke but four years later I'm still waiting for the ha-ha payoff. It's something I think about every day, always in the background noise of my brain, just the disparity in our gifts.

We talk about this a lot. It's my ""go to"" petty line when we're fighting, something I say in the moment that really digs in. I argue that we should lift our separate assets ""clause"" for her wedding gift. What I got her is an investment, something you pass down to your kids, something that might be worth something some day. It's the most expensive single item either of us owns to give an idea. She insists it's hers and hers alone.

I'd be lying if I said this doesn't put a strain on our marriage but am I in the wrong? Whenever I ask why she spent $13 on my gift, she said she wanted to break the tradition of a sentimental gift on wedding nights because it's a turbulent topic in our culture. But she was all fine with it up until it happened, even asking me for ideas and dropping hints on what she wanted.

0,"WIBTA for breaking a promise to my sergeant to keep quiet? | Last year I completed the police academy and was hired by the local PD as a CSO (Community Service Officer). A few months ago there was an opening for a law enforcement officer position and I was told to apply by my sergeant. The application process was extensive and required several background/credit checks and interviews with family members, friends, and previous employers. Everything seemed to be going well, and I was getting a ton of positive feedback from the higher-ups.

Fast forward to last week, I was offered the position and was told that I'd be sworn in next month along with another graduate from the police academy. I was super excited and shared the news with my immediate family. Then yesterday the captain called me into his office for a meeting. After an exchange of pleasantries, he then notified me that my offer had been rescinded. I asked him what the reason was, and he stated that another candidate ended up being more qualified than me. It didn't make any sense, but I didn't want to question the captain's decision.

Today I was talking to my sergeant about the captain rescinding my offer. I have a great working relationship with my sergeant, and honestly he feels like a father figure to me. After listening to me vent my frustrations, my sergeant confided that the offer had been rescinded because the captain found out I was 12 weeks pregnant (I'm not showing). He told me the department wasn't comfortable putting a pregnant woman out in the field. He also added that I should apply again after I gave birth. I asked if he agreed with the captain's decision, and he said it didn't matter because it wasn't up to him. We ended the conversation with me promising not to say anything about what I was told.

It's been several hours since I got off my shift, and I am still seething. I'm pissed off that the captain rescinded my offer based on my pregnancy. I know this is workplace discrimination, and it's the most disappointing fucking thing that it's happening in the PD. I know I shouldn't have promised my sergeant that I wouldn't say anything. At the time when he asked me to keep it between us, I still hadn't completely processed what I had been told and was kind of just being compliant. Now that I've had more time to think about it, I feel like discussing this with an employment attorney. I know pursuing this will result in my immediate dismissal from the PD, but at this point I don't care. I really don't want to work for a place that condones discrimination.

My moral dilemma is having to cite my source (my sergeant) when I talk to an attorney. There is no doubt in my mind that he will have to face some backlash from the captain and possibly the rest of the department for letting the cat out of the bag. It would also be the end of our friendship, for sure.

0,"AITA for insulting a creep at the gym? | TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm a female and in my early 20s. I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. 

Yesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. 

At this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him ""can I help you with something?"" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him ""there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits"" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. 

After about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)

I feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.

My mom actually offered to do the dishes on my sisters days which surprised me because she’s never really helped out with the chores much.

First week of summer comes along and I do my dishes like usual. When it came to my moms turn she didn’t do them right away. She waited 2 maybe 3 weeks before doing them. It got so bad that I’d have to wash myself a dish to eat off of for every meal. Eventually she did do them. Half of them.

She loaded them into the dishwasher (the same dishwasher she has claimed “doesn’t clean the dishes enough”. We’ve always hand washed them) and most came out pretty clean. But she only did half and the rule usually is that if you don’t finish the dishes you have to finish them before the next person does them.

She said that she’d finish the dishes the next day. I believed her because she had actually done half of them this time.

She didn’t do them.

Now she’s waited about 4 weeks to do them. But this time she’s claiming that the dishes aren’t rinsed enough and she’s not doing them so it’s my turn.

(A little backstory here is that for a VERY long time me and my sister have constantly complained about her not rinsing her dishes AT ALL. She either ignores us or says that she made the food so she shouldn’t have to. She rarely cooks.)

Admittedly yes there are about 6 dishes that aren’t rinsed nearly enough and that’s likely my fault. Also there are quite a few peanut butter knives that are poorly rinsed. But there’s also a large amount of perfectly rinsed dishes in there.

This morning I got a ton of birthday calls from family and a gift from my brother. He looked quite apprehensive about giving it to me and quietly explained he wasn't happy with the gift and didn't think I'd like it.

I made sure my message was a polite as it could be and that I didn't sound accusatory because I didn't want to start a fight over a bad gift. Well, that's kinda what happened. My mum messaged back defensive and annoyed because from her perspective it was a beautiful necklace that would go nicely with my dress for going out (it wouldn't at all for a plethora of reasons), it was more expensive than the allocated amount so I should be grateful, and it was bought overseas so they have no way to return it.

I keep telling him we have enough and we’re financially responsible, but she just shuts me down & tells me I don’t know how expensive babies are. He’ll send me money unsolicited, with passive aggressive messages implying that he’s saving us from poverty. 

I finally found out the reason why he’s acting that way. I have a cousin with a 1 year old baby who keeps insisting he can’t afford the baby, even on a dual income, and needed financial help. Their baby even sleeps on a mat on the floor of their living room instead of a cot. He has various family members sending him money and buying stuff for his baby. 

I had to quit working due to health reasons, so my husband does make less than what my cousin & his wife makes combined, and my dad knows it. 

The thing is, I’m friends with my cousin’s wife on Facebook and I know they actually have a lot of money for the baby. His wife actually went on a dive trip in a private yacht in the Maldives when the baby was 4 months old. That costs at least $10,000, so there’s no way you can’t afford a cot if you can afford that. 

I thought I should just let me dad see how well my husband is taking care of the family and he’d realize that yes, my husband is financially responsible. 

I gave birth in one of the top private hospitals in our country, and our baby is definitely spoiled since I’ve been splurging on all the best baby products for her. And yes, we can afford a damn cot for her. 

Unfortunately, my dad still hasn’t changed his mind. When he visited me in the hospital after I delivered, he was on his phone the entire time, and the only thing he said to me as soon as my husband left the room was, “Do you need money?”

I’m getting so tired of how he’s treating my husband & I really want to just tell him my cousin is just bullshitting to the entire family to get easy money. Would it be a dick move to expose how full of shit my cousin is by showing my dad his wife’s Facebook posts? It looks like they’ve placed the entire family on limited profile, but I use a different name so I think she forgot about me.",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness

Jason and I were really close, he was there for me when I came out as gay to my family and always stood by me during hard times and we even dated for a while but things didn't work out romantically. I lent him 500$ last year because he had some debts he had to pay off and I told him he could pay me back in increments and I didn't expect it all back in one go. He was fine with this arrangement and paid me back 25 each paycheck. He then lost his job so I told him not to worry about it and to pay me back when he could. Few months go by and I lent him another 300$ with him promising hr would pay back and then after a while he got a really good paying job through his husband's company. I asked him if he could possibly start paying me back since my hours had been cut at my job since things were slow. 

A few months went by and he hadn't paid me at all but he wasn't quiet about his big purchases of a new 2018 Porsche, all the weed he was buying weekly and a Rolex for his husband for his birthday. I shot him a message saying if he could please start paying me back since he can clearly afford all these things but I was left on read. I started to make peace with the fact that I probably wouldn't be seeing that money again so I just started to distance myself from Jason

This morning I woke up from 2 notifications. 1 was from Paypal saying Jason had sent me 1000$ and the second was a message from Jason saying he accidentally sent me that money and if I could please send it back. I thought about it for a second but then thought how it would greatly help with some backed up bills I had. However to be fair I was just gonna take the amount he owed me (which was about 600). I told him I would send back 400 but keep the 600 he owed me. He started to blow my phone up saying I was a thief and a bunch of other names and expletives. I told him that if that's how he's going to be then he can forget about getting any money back then I blocked him. 

My boyfriend said I was in the right and so did some of my other friends but some other friends said it was a dick move and that I have to be ""the bigger person"" and send back all the money.

0,"WIBTA if I stopped cleaning the office for my coworkers? | So a little backstory. I work in a small office with 6 other people. We don't have a budget for an office cleaner so we take turns each week cleaning the washrooms, taking the garbage out, and some light housekeeping to keep the place nice. 

We have our weeks on a calendar and make arrangements to trade weeks if someone is busy or out of the office.

There are 3 co workers who either ""forget"" to do their week or do a half-ass job and the other 3 fix for them. 

Last week one of the ""forgetful"" ones didn't clean the office on Friday. I thought of leaving it but the bathrooms were bad and the garbag bins were stinky. I took care of it and left her a note letting her know she missed her week and asked if she could take a week for me when I would be away from work. She agreed to the switch and said she was sorry she missed her week.

Well today is Friday and I am currently the only one in the office. It's a long weekend here so half of then took the day off and the other two worked a half day. The person in charge of this week left at 12 and said ""see ya Tuesday!""

The bathrooms are gross and the garbage bins are full. I don't think it's fair that I have to clean it again just because I'm the only one here. But I also think it's not fair to leave it to the next person as that person always does a great job and it shouldn't be on them to do double. 

In the past, we have mentioned to the person who blew off this week that they don't do their fair share and they threw a stink fit and ignored half of us (me included) for a month.

1,"AITA for taking my stolen dog for 2 years from a family which loved her? | I adopted my dog from a shelter August 15, 2014. It was a small sized mutt which looked a little like a collie, so we named her Collie. Collie is the 3rd member of our childless household of family pets, we had 1 more dog and a cat.


We had Collie let loose to run around the neighbourhood every evening, and she would come back in about 30 minutes. It wasn't that we won't walk her, she just doesn't do well with a leash and prefers to run around all by herself. Our other dog prefers to be leashed and me or my wife would walk her every other day. 


One day Collie didn't return, it was 11 May 2018(yes I record down the dates). We were devastated and looked for her for weeks. Posters with reward, social media and shelters, we did everything we could. Eventually we gave up and accepted that we may never see Collie again.


Last month, I was visiting a client's house and on the way happened to saw Collie entertaining herself in somebody's yard. I wasn't sure at first, but the similarities were definitely there, so I called out her name and she actually raised her head and responded, that confirmed it. I went knocking on the door and 2 children answered, the adults weren't home.


It turns out that the younger child of the family took Collie from the streets, thinking that she was abandoned. The family took Collie in and never bothered to find her owners(Collie had been microchipped and my contact number was on her collar). 


I told the 2 children that I will be taking Collie and left them my number, telling them to let their parents contact me for the expenses for 2 years, I will pay them. They tried to stop me but I warned them that they have stolen my dog and that stopped them. 


I had been in contact with their parents and they've begged me to return Collie to them. They said that they could even pay me for her. I said no, Collie is part of my family and they should have thought of that when they decided to keep a stolen dog.


I had been running through pictures of the family's Facebook Page and from the videos and pictures it seems that they really did loved her and treated her very well. It doesn't excuse them from stealing her though.

When she came over today I asked her to take this second pregnancy test just to be sure. She adamantly refused saying that it shows that I dont trust her. She was extremely upset and started saying stuff like, ''If you can't even trust me when I say I'm pregnant how could we raise a child together?''

This is nto about trust at all to me, this is about being sure. I would also get a DNA test or wHatever it is to make sure I'm the father. This isn't because of trust, it's because I've heard of horror stories and I don't want to end up like that.

0,"AITA for refusing to believe that my dog tried to attack someone? | Basically what the title says. 

My dog Cerberus is a bit of a mutt. He was a rescue and was found as a stray so we're not entirely sure *what* he is, but judging by his size and the shape of his head, there's some Doberman in him somewhere. He's a big, big guy and I get that he looks a bit intimidating and hell-houndish (hence why I named him Cerberus) but he's honestly the chillest dog I've ever met. He only really gets excitable at playtime; other than that he's a lazy sod and is incredibly content to just lie down in his favourite spot for literal *hours* and only get up for food. 

The issue at hand happened yesterday. I had a small gathering at my house. Not so much a party, but just a handful of friends over to play board games, eat food and drink wine. One of the people in attendance was my friend's new girlfriend of ~2months. She hadn't been to my place yet and hadn't met Cerberus. According to my friend, she'd given no indication prior that she was nervous of dogs but as soon as she arrived at mine she became visibly on edge. I asked what was up and she (quite rudely) said ""Nobody mentioned there was gonna be a *massive* dog here."" I kinda laughed and said ""Oh yeah but don't worry he probably won't move all evening."" She asked if he could be put outside or something because she'd been ""almost bitten"" (her words) by a Doberman as a child and was frightened of him. I said no to putting him outside because it was chilly and that's not fair, but did concede to put him in the kitchen while we played games. I thought that was the end of it, but the GF later got up to go to the toilet, which meant she had to cross through the kitchen. While in the kitchen she began screaming and freaking out. We naturally rushed through and she said that Cerberus had gotten up and came over and ""made to attack her"". I argued this wasn't the case, he'd simply gotten up and come over because he was curious who was in the room. She insisted it was terrifying and I kept arguing that I *know* my dog, he's never bitten anyone in the four years I've had him and he's not vicious. She kept saying ""any dog can turn"", which I agreed to, but maintain that he hadn't and wouldn't. She and my friend eventually left. She's maintaining that he tried to bite her and made her ""afraid for her life"" and that he should've been put outside. I'm maintaining that if he'd acted as viciously as she's saying we'd have heard barking or growling or something, and we didn't, alongside the fact that he is categorically not an aggressive dog.

1,"AITA for asking date why she would not hold hands and asking if it was due to her cultural upbringing? | Throwaway. So I was on a date a couple of weeks ago; and I've just been thinking about it for a while. So on the date, I asked her to hold two times. Both times she denied my request, which was totally fine. And I did not push her into holding my hand in anyway. The first objection was her concern for PDA, so I asked her later when we were just walking on the street and not too many people around. She said no again and I didn't really ask her why.

The following is where I may be an asshole or whether I should have simply not done. I ended up texting her and asked her why she wouldn't hold hands. I thought the date was fine and what not, but was also just curious. I asked her if maybe if she wanted to take things slow.

She didn't answer for a few hours. And then one of my friends suggested that maybe it was a cultural thing (she's from Asia). I then texted her saying sorry and asked her if it was a cultural thing. Still no response and I go to bed, not really sure if I had just made a fool of myself and what not.

I wake up in the morning to a text saying that I was really nice and sweet, but it wasn't just a romantic chemistry between us. So obviously this is the reason why she didn't hold hands. But was an asshole for asking if it was a cultural thing? If I wasn't an asshole, should I still not have texted? Or is it fine?

Well no, not really, but I write stories and post them on writing websites to collaborate with other aspiring authors.

The author was 12 so I never expected much. I took the idea, drabbled with it and made it my own. There wasn't many similarities other than plot, characters and climax. I received phenomenal support from others on this website and attain quite a large group of readers. Now this other version, the 12 year old's, wasn't very popular, especially compared to mine. She approached me, admitted something I didn't need to hear (bad parents, no friends, bullied, writing was her only escape, blah, blah, blah) and asked me to take down my story. I didn't because that wasn't her right to ask me. Someone starts the rumor I 'stole the idea'. My readers didn't take this to well.

When we lived on the other coast, I noticed a habit of immediately volunteering cash to her sister whenever she needed it for bills, etc.  Sister and husband are good people, weren’t devoid of funds because they were spending it on stupid stuff, they both worked, etc, and I get being all about family.  What annoyed me a little bit was that I was working massive OT, and then a second job, for us to save up for our dream wedding, and she just lend them the money without even asking me or discussing it.

Since we got here, my wife has bent over backwards to be accommodating to her family.  We were here nearly two years before we had our daughter, and during that time my wife would always watch out nieces and nephews whenever asked.  Even if she had work at 4 or 5 am the next day, she couldn’t say no.  And if childcare was needed and she wasn’t available, she would volunteer me first, and ask me about it later.  No consideration for how tired or anything else we may be.  Now that we have a child of our own, the stress and exhaustion level of her mom and sisters always factors into whether we ask them for help, usually I end up switching my work schedule around.

The last straw came with a move her sister’s family just made.  They were living in the house her mom owns and paying half the mortgage.  Now they have moved out because her mom wants to get it ready to sell.  The process of deciding if they should move out is a whole other story, but the back and forth has been about a year plus.  Suddenly, when they are going, they realize their mom will need a fridge.

So I got engaged recently and my friends and family want to celebrate. I work weekends so I’m always pretty busy but I had two dates that would be the best time for a dinner or something like that since me and my fiancé don’t want anything too big. We said we would be happy with a few drinks and not a party with lots of people, we only wanted something low-key since we’re both not really outgoing people.

That was fine, I told my parents and my mom picked one of the dates. To be very clear, it was agreed that this would be a dinner with only close family on my side, just a dinner with drinks and nothing else.

Then a couple of days ago, in front of most of my close family, my mom announces that we’re having a party in our house which includes my family and my fiancé’s. Everyone is really excited about it and my sister asks if she can invite her friends as well. Me and my fiancé are taken aback and don’t really know what to say and since I’ve been put in an awkward situation, I kind of agree to keep everyone happy.

I talked to my mom later privately and told her again we didn’t want a big party and she agreed, saying it wasn’t going to be “that big”. I asked how many people would likely be going and she said as many as you want, then listed off all the people on my side that would want to come. I tried to explain that my fiancé’s close family is quite big and they would not all fit in our house (We both still live with our parents but are trying to move out soon) but she kind of brushed it off and said that we could invite whoever we want.

Now this thing we didn’t want is growing arms and legs. My sister is inviting her friends who are wanting to get their hair professionally done for the party when I’m not even going to that effort myself. A distant family member is coming over from another country and people I barely know from distant parts of my family are asking if I’m having something and giving me very generous engagement presents. It made me and my fiancé feel quite uncomfortable to say the least.

I just want to say that we do appreciate that people want to celebrate the fact we got engaged and it’s nice of them to sort of organise something for us but not to this extent. We would probably have to book a venue and catering for all these people going now and we really don’t want to spend massive amounts of money since we’re trying to save.

My fiancé says we should just cancel everything and tell everyone the party is off but I’m more reluctant since I don’t want to offend anyone. So we’ve decided to take it to reddit because we’re both suck on what to do and how to handle this without coming off as complete assholes.

I washed my dishes but ignored his, washed and ironed my clothes but not his, didn't cook for him anymore and I've been ignoring anything he says that isn't an apology but he refuses to apologize saying he wasn't in the wrong. And now he apparently told our mom what I've been doing and she's mad at me.

0,"AITA for not reimbursing my boyfriend for a concert he wouldn't let me go alone to? | Hello everyone, this is my first post because I really just wanted to see the opinions on this situation that happened a few months ago now. 

My boyfriend (22M) and I (19F) are long distance, and I had been planning to visit him over winter break. Coincidentally, my favorite group of all time was going on a world tour and would be making a stop where he lives while I would be visitinhg. So, naturally I really wanted to go because I was already going to be there and would save on a trip. 

I bring it up to him (a few months before I was gonna go when it was announced), and naturally he's not really enthused because the music isn't his cup of tea, and he somewhat blows it off. Over the course of me waiting for me to go and getting everything situated, I bring up a few more times to show that I do have serious intent to go. He kinda doesn't want me to because he would have to go (we'd have to take a train to the destination because it wasn't /in/ his city but a nearby town) and he was not letting me go alone. So fast forward to the day before, I had been scouring money to buy some tickets and I found some realtively good seats for a good price. I believe they were $100 each. Beforehand, I had asked my boyfriend how much he was willing to spend on his ticket and he said $80-90. When I made this deal with the person selling the tickets, I asked if he was willing to go $10 more for the $100, and he said fine. He sends me the money and I get us the tickets. We go, and I was having a great time although he didn't know any of the songs and didn't like the group. Towards the end, he was getting angry because he thought the concert was ending and it wasn't (encore) and he kept huffing and puffing next to me and I had to do my best to NOT let him ruin my mood. So the trip home was tense because he was mad that he went and it didn't end on his terms and I was mad because he was really throwing a tantrum.

Anyways, the trip ends and when I come back home, he was saying suddenly that I owe him $100. I honestly thought he was joking and was confused and asked him for what, and he said for his concert ticket and I said that I would pay him back. This, I definitely DID NOT do and if anything I said I would pay him back the difference. I barely had enough money for my ticket and was basically broke after the trip so there was no way I could nor did I feel like I should. He actually got rather upset and ended up telling me to just drop the subject and it has dissapated since. 

All in all, I felt like I shouldn't pay him back because he was already willing to put in up to $90 on his own without me asking, and also he wouldn't have let me go by myself and knew I wasn't going to pass up the opportunity. So, AITA?",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness

I still thing he’s just messing around, so I just roll my eyes and say “I’ll need a ring first”. He then got upset and said “If I bought you a ring would you still react like that?”

1,"AITA for asking my bf to just give me money instead of expensive things? | I (19F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) for about 6 months. I come from a rather poor background, and had to work for things that I needed. My boyfriend grew up middle class, but has a considerably large amount of savings and wealth he gains from his own business, investments etc. I still work at my job (but do much less hours) because my bf pays for my bills and lets me live in his house with his parents. Since we started dating he would always pick up the tab on anything we went out to do, dates, restaurants, because he feels it would be wrong to expect me to pay for those things (considering the difference in our access to money). 

&#x200B;

But heres the thing, he gets me ridiculously expensive gifts on christmas and my birthday. Don't get me wrong, I think its very sweet and thoughtful, but in some of these cases I could have just gotten the money and I would have been perfectly okay with that. He buys me diamond jewelry (which I love), and nice phones, computers etc. These are all worth literally thousands of dollars, more than I have made ever working at my job. I brought it up to him that I'd be cool with him just giving me money instead of gifts, and he got really upset. He said ""That is not the point of a gift, you don't choose what it is, it is a gift not a payment"". And now he feels insulted that I would suggest something like that. I just wanted to suggest that if he likes ""spoiling"" he could just give me money, but apparently I'm crossing a line here?

Usually when I try to make plans with him I always get the typical ""sure, I don't have any plans yet but I can't if I am spontaneously going out"" which in 80% of all cases means that he won't have time since he would rather hang out with other people (notifiying me half an hour before we were planned to meet), making me sort of feel like the second choice he has to do something with when all his other plans get cancelled.

I don't know how many times I was stood up waiting for him just to get a text half an hour before telling me that he won't come.

Today, he asked me if I wanted to go out to eat something, but I was already invited by my family for dinner. So I told him I can't come.
As a result to this, he got a bit mad and said that I should cancel since I can have dinner with my family any other day as well.
I refused, saying that they invited me weeks ago unlike him (2 hours before he wanted to go out) and if he wanted to reschedule.

It never got to the reschedule part since he was so mad at me for being so unspontaneous, that I did not get another answer.

I feel like it's just fair that I refuse to cancel my plans with my family, simply because his plans were cancelled and was spontaneously looking for something else to do.

1,"AITA for ""docking"" my husband's ""pay""? | Hey all,

My (F30) husband (M32) is currently the primary caregiver of our daughters (F5 & F2). He works part time from home in the tax industry, and is naturally busy right now. I work in a medical research related area so am naturally very busy. I am also 4 months pregnant.

Anyways, my husband is supposed to do all the house work that can be done while I am way for the day. He does the house work in general. I understand that due to tax season and the older one being out of school things are tougher for him but I feel that there are certain expectations to be met. Consistently though, he has been more focused on work and the kids and has put the house work on the back burner. For the past three days he has not cooked dinner and has simply ordered take out. I get that he is busy but if I as a pregnant woman during a buys time can do my job, surely he can do his.

Normally, I give him 10% of my paycheque to spend on personal items for himself (not household expenses, this I just give him so that he can have more spending money since, outside of tax season, he is basically unemployed. I keep 20% of my paycheque for my personal spending and the rest of my paycheque, and all of his, are placed in a joint account). Unhappy with his inability to cook for the house and do stuff that every Mother somehow manages, I opted to not give him his 10% this pay period. My husband is extremely angry at me.

I'm now working much less and I'm less tired and I'm managing to save myself academically.

Last night for dinner, my parents decided to order pizza rather than cook. Money is luckily no issue around here. They were going to order an extra large pizza for the 2 of them to share and then a medium pizza each for my brother and I. 

For some reason my brother didn’t want a medium pizza all to himself (?) and he kept telling me we should just split an extra large one instead. 

I said no because the medium pizza from this pizza place is actually rather large and I can get a second meal out of the leftovers. As well I just wanted to order whatever pizza I wanted and not have to agree on toppings. 

My brother kept saying it made more sense for us to share one and wouldn’t take no for an answer. I was annoyed and my parents were annoyed because they just wanted to order and he wouldn’t commit to anything. Finally I said “No I don’t want to share a pizza with you because you eat way faster and more than me and I don’t want to have to compete for pizza.” This is so true. I actually cook all my own meals partially because otherwise at dinner he eats more and faster than me and I don’t get as much.

I am 50 ft away from the lip of the transition to the lower field and out of sight of the other dogs and owners.

After a few throws another dog came over and took the ball when my dog dropped it. This dog proceeded to return to their owner. No big deal, I have treats, I figure I can negotiate.

I walk over and before I can say anything the owner says ""he wont give the ball back."" I try to offer the treat and the dog is indifferent, hes just avoiding me.

I ask the lady to help and she says she cant do anything. I ask if I can take my ball and she says that the dog will bite. She offers to have me follow her through the trail network to her car, 30 mins away, to get another ball. Normally I would have been fine with it, but we were leaving soon so I didnt have time. I tell her that I dont have time and she just says 'oh well, see you next week.'

I say that's not ok, I need my ball. At this point she's calling me unreasonable. She asks what I expect her to do,  and I suggest either getting me my ball or buying a new one. At this point she starts on a tirade of how I'm the worst person shes ever met and how I'm not welcome at this public dog park.

I tell her I'll accept 5 dollars for the ball (turns out my wife paid $24 for 3 balls), and she begrudgingly starts to count out change as she continues to berate me. I made a few comments about her **four** dogs being untrained and how she should be a better dog owner and then left.

Anyways, this happened five days ago when I was over at a college buddy’s of mine. He still lives with his parents who have a pretty nice place and they’re currently abroad so it seemed like a good opportunity to invite some friends over for some mindless drinking. We’re not really all that close anymore- both about to graduate, we were tightest in the first few semesters, but still hang out fairly regularly. I guess you could say he’s more of a chad/business kind of guy, while I enjoy more erudite pursuits.. 

Anyways, I mention this because this friend (some bitterness writing this now, after what happened) had just been on a serious workout-kick for a few months and he talked our ears off about his gains. We’re the type of friends to pretty much openly poke fun at each other, so he was well roasted for his outspoken self-love..

Anywhos, as the evening went on and everybody got drunker and drunker, I openly told him that I didn’t think his biceps looked very impressive/defined. We’d been in the pool and all still sat shirtlessly around the edge, imbibing the Goose. For some reason this remark (don’t know how I worded it) shifted the dynamics of the situation. I guess he saw me as the kind of meek intellectual character of our group (think Sherlock or Yoda) and he appeared sincerely insulted.

He said something like “Think you can take me on, champ?”; I said I sincerely believed yes, but this conversation was stupid and not worth it so he should cool down now. Well, he said he never had fighting in mind, but no wonder I was pu\*sying out already. I laughed it off, and when he called me spaghetti-boy most people thought it was lame. He didn’t let it go though and proposed we should arm wrestle under the supervision of the others to settle the matter.

Now, I’m no chicken but I was really annoyed. I asked him why I should do this and insisted that I wouldn’t do it without proper motivation. He looked around thinking, then, seeing his little pug Opal, who’d sort of hung out with us during the course of the partying (running around). Opal was brushing up against me leg and he knew I adored the pupper, so he said: “You win, you get her.” He was so fucking sure of himself to make this idiotic bet. The only reason I agreed was because it made me legitimately mad that he could be so arrogant to pawn off that his dog, even when drunk.

Well, guess what. After a long back and forth and his shitty cockiness reaching a fever-pitch, I defeated him fair & square (three times). I took home the dog (who accepts me) and he completely FLIPPED OUT because I took him at his word. Opal is happy with me aside from some micturition issues and I don’t think this “friend” deserves his dog back, after proposing this demented bet. Who knows what he would do if he kept it?

I work from 9 to 5 every day of the week and sometimes I get a little extra time at lunch (usually like an hour or so). Well the past two times I have gone home to visit my wife at lunch and spend some afternoon time with her. From what she has told me after today (she mentioned it last time but I brushed it off as her just having a bad day) she doesnt like it because it interrupts her schedule... So after talking she admited it was an issue on her part and that I need to call her before coming home. Keep in mind this is my apartment too and I pay all of the bills and she only works 2 days a week. I (in admittedly not my best moment) told her very bluntly that I shouldnt have to call to say I was coming home for lunch in my own house. And that how she was acting was making me feel unwelcome at home. 

She didn't take this well and cried and I cuddled her and told her I loved her very much. And she calmed down and was happy again. But honestly I'm still upset. 

If it helps y'all she has an anxiety disorder and when she has issues she tends to lash out verbally and passive aggressively. We got into a shouting match today because I snapped first but that was only because of the stress that she has been putting on me with making me feel unwelcome.

1,"AITA for asking my fiancee/girlfriend [28F] to work 80 hours a week in order to pay off her debt in time for our marriage? | I have been doing the same thing since last November.

I have $70K in debt, all of it student loans. I got a second job. It will take me until the beginning of next year to pay off my debt.  I am looking at working about 80 hours making $130K. It sucks, but I realized I am not going to get out of debt quickly any other way.

She has around $60K debt.  She financed her father's treatment for cancer (who is thankfully in remission) on credit card.

She works as a teacher working 60-65 hours a week making around $65K. I told her if she works another 15 hours tutoring people she can easily make $15K-$20K. She can easily be debt free in around 18 months. If she gets another job or starts tutoring people, I can help her and she'll be done quicker.

She is calling me an asshole because she already ""compromised"" by agreeing to do a budget.

I told her doing a budget means nothing if we are not cutting our spending and increasing our income.

She said that working 80 hours a week will be bad for her mental health (she has a history of depression).

I told her that I had/have depression (as diagnosed by the doctor).  If I can do it, she can as well. I also told her that her mental health will be worse with the debt hanging like an albatross on her neck. Hell, paying of debt is important for my mental health because it is stressing me out.

She resents the fact that she, in her words, ""never sees me"" and that this will hurt our relationship.

I told her that if we didn't figure out our debt problems, we would definitely get divorced because money problems cause fights.

She said I was a asshole and cheapskate because I am demanding we reduce our spending on food by not going out, not eating fancy stuff like avocado, and not spending money on Netflix. Currently, we are paying $450.  She thinks that $350 per month on groceries between the both of us is too low.  It isn't.

Breakfast: Milk and banana ($0.40)

Lunch: spaghetti ($2) or salad ($3.50). 

Dinner: two cheese ($2) or tomatoes/cucumbers without cheese($2.50) sandwiches.

Total is ~$5-6 per person per day, per month ~$180. We can meet the $350 guideline if she stops buying avocado ($0.50 per avocado), she only eats salads on the weekends, and we shop at a different grocery store for some other things.

I told her to cancel her gym membership ($40). She can run on the streets. She called me an asshole for suggesting this. Apparently, I wasn't checking my ""male privilege"" because she feels afraid as a woman, running at night. She has never told me this before. I told her we can arrange our schedules so she can run with me. I cancelled my gym membership and run alone in the park. 

She wants to go on a honeymoon after our wedding, but if we don't get out of our debt, I am not going to enjoy the honeymoon because I will feel guilty due to debt.

The sports I train on also makes me a little bit bulky and my skin a little darker and rougher. I have short hair and often dress tomboyishly(is that a word?), also occasionally apply makeups to make my features more masculine to the point of getting mistaken as a guy by strangers sometimes. It is nothing complicated really, I just find myself looking better this way as I look awkwardly like a drag queen if I dress like a girl.


While my whole class knows about me, there is one particular girl who(serious or joking) always assume that I am either a lesbian or a FTM in the making. She spoke as if it's already fact and decided without considering my opinion. When I confront her about this, her reply was ""But (my name), you play rough sports, you dress like a boy, you hang out with boys!"" And suggest me to sort out my own identity myself, which I rolled my eyes and just left her be, we were not close enough to be discussing my identity anyway. 


There's recently a new guy who joined the class, a rather handsome one, I must say. We were introducing ourselves to him one by one as he walked around. When it was my turn, right after I told him my name, the girl called out :""Don't get your hopes up, she's a gay!"" And the whole class laughed.


I may be laughing along but in fact I was quite irritated. So I walked up to her, announced: ""Yups, and meet (her name), my girlfriend."" And gave her a  quick peck on the lips. She could not break free before the contact because I am much stronger than her, you know. The class then laughed again with cheers and claps and the new guy joined them. That girl though, after the initial shock, ran out of the classroom.

It was meant to only be a temporary arrangement after they were kicked out of the flat they were renting but they have been enjoying the free child care and low rent and have had little motive to move out, much to my parents frustration.
Their sleeping arrangement is a bit odd as my brother sleeps alone (he works shifts of all different hours including nights) while his wife and my niece have taken over my old bedroom. I moved out almost 5 years ago and have my own place a couple of hours journey away but I still have stuff at my parents house and my old room is pretty much unchanged so they are sleeping surrounded by my old belongings.

0,"AITA for not moving out of my seat for a large group of students in my school’s library? | So I’m usually in the library during my dead times between classes. It’s not unusual to see segregated tables. All the Asians in their own tables, and Indians in their own tables. These two groups tend to take up whole tables, but on one floor, all the Indians hang out there and take up to like 4 tables. I have no problem with this, because there’s really no reason to be. It’s not peculiar to stick with similar people, and that’s what they’re doing, and I don’t have any problem with it. 

I come in early in the morning on test days to study for an hour or two. At this time, the tables haven’t become of one group of people yet. I sat in the first table that was the least populated at the time. The groups of friends that sit in the same tables, are always situated in the same tables, so maybe their argument that these are their tables is valid. 

So after about 40 minutes of studying, the groups of them start situating themselves at the usual tables in groups of 3-5. It’s the usual, and I’m not bothering anyone so I don’t really bat an eye. Soon enough, the table is fully occupied with the select group of students, and then there’s me, kind of in the middle of the table. 

I don’t mind being surrounded by them and their conversations, since they’re all med students and I honestly like hearing what they talk about, or their gossip. I’ve sat at other tables and they’ve talked loudly enough for me to pick up everything. And sometimes I laugh when they laugh because they’re having a good time and they’re ambiance is enjoyable. 

So once they started pouring in, they surrounded me, since I was in the middle seat. They usually take other chairs so they can all sit at the same table. I didn’t mind them sitting around me at all. I’m doing my work and not causing a problem. At one point, one of them walks in after everyone is seated and he pointed at me like “Who’s this kid.” I didn’t pay attention to it and kept reading my stuff. 

They asked me to move, but I told them “he can just pull up another chair, its going to be hard for me to find somewhere else to sit.” I don’t know where he’d find this chair, since there’s none available. 

They kept reassuring me to move from my seat for this last one, but it’s a hassle to find a new seat at this time of day. They asked me to move like three more times and I finally just sighed and informed him, “Bro, I’m not gonna move for you. I was here before anyone else at this table.”

My friend thinks I'm an asshole but I'm pretty firm on not the asshole here.

I  spent half my day driving around looking for this thing because I could  use the cash. I ended up spotting it at a local taco shop where strays  are known to hang out (no joke), grabbed it, contacted the owner.

I  was working out the logistics and the owner said they don't have the  money to pay me the reward. That sucks, but the reason I spent my day  looking for this dog was to get the reward.

Her trip overseas was 3 months so she didn't want me to get lonely and I would have something to hold onto while I slept and night if I missed her. While she was overseas we broke up but she wanted to stay friends. after that it was a hard 5 months of us being ""friends"" because the break up was not mutual and I still wanted to be with her. about a month ago I decided to not speak to her due to my own mental health.

She told me that she was not comfortable with me having it and that it could be used against her. I in no way hate or resent her, she holds a special place in my heart as my first love and I would never do something like that.

It's a harmless scrapbook. I was thinking about giving it to her, however she didn't speak to me nicely, she guilt tripped me into handing it over and never bothered to ask me how I was.

0,"AITA for kicking my roommate's lover out of our appartment? | Hi,

&#x200B;

Context: I (25M) live with 3 roommates (2M, 1F). 3 of us have been around for over 2 years and the last one (28F), lets call her M, arrived a 6 months ago. Our flat is really nice: large living-room, nice veranda, close to the city, right in front of a park AND the rent is pretty low. When our last roommmate left, we had 3/4 persons come visit. Then we went with our feelings and invited M to join us.

&#x200B;

We thought it could be tough to join a team of people who already knew each other well. So we decided to make her fell home by having a nice dinner the night she arrived. During the dinner, she let us know that she had a BF. No trouble for us, he could stay whenever they wanted as long as she'd let us know if he'd be spending the night. Then she let us know that he was her boss (38M, lets call him C). Ok, I wouldn't go for it but her life, her decision. Then she added that he was married... With a kid. My 2 roommates were still kinda chill about it but I felt uncomfortable. The evening went on, we changed the topic, and I decided for myself that I'd avoid spending too much time with C whenever he'd be around, and that's it. Beside, she's a very joyfyl girl so I really kept my feelings to myself. The only annoying things being that he played a lot with her feeling, making her cry ofter and also they were loud when being intimate, but I assumed it was part of life in a flat.

&#x200B;

Story: A couple weeks ago, I was reading in our veranda when M came back. FYI her room has a huge window so I can see what happens in her room from the veranda.

She comes up to me, I ask how she's doing and she says it's a rough day. I asked why. She told me that C left his wife. I didn't know what to answer. At the same moment, I saw him laying his suitcase on her bed in her room. As I was really annoyed by this situation, I to avoid words I might regret and talk with the other flatmates before taking any decision only based on my feelings. So I let her get back to her room.

&#x200B;

My roommate eventually came back and I told them about the situation. I suggested we let C a week to decide his next step and then we'd ask him to move out. This might sound short but come on, the guy is 38, married with a kid, he should think about his actions. My flatmates agreed and I let M & C know about our decision.

&#x200B;

The week went by and C locked himself in M's room every night. So I eventually knocked on the door. M opened and C was laying on the bed (clothed), I told him that the week was over and we were expecting him to move out. C rolled over on the bed and didn't say a word. M went up to me half crying and told me to that she was allowed to spend time with her BF.

She's asked me to make sure the children stay in bed until 7;10 at the earliest or to go in and play with them to keep the noise down.

I refused because I'm not going to make them sleep in and because I'm usually busy making their breakfast or doing something else at that time, we can't all sleep in the morning.

She said when the children sleep in can I sleep in too?, well no I can't because i have things to do? She says I wake her up whenever I get up earlier and it's inconsiderate, I don't think that's true.

She thinks I'm acting like an AH and ""dramatising"" things, apparently it's simple (it's not) and that because she works for the family I can do this, I can't because I'm busy.

A few years later, he got remarried and had another daughter. Since I don’t really talk to my dad, I do not really know my half-sister that well. I love her and wish her no ill-will obviously, but we’re not close. It’s just despite living a half-hour away, I see her maybe once or twice a year. If that.

Anyway, now I’m 25-years-old and my sister is 7. My dad recently asked me to dinner with my step-mother to have a talk about something, which was weird. He said that they were doing a lot of estate planning recently. He talked about what I would be inheriting, what my half-sister would get, etc. He discussed what kind of lifestyle he would want her to have if they passed before she were an adult (my dad and step-mom are wealthy). Then they talked about how on our side of the family, there’s not really anyone who could take her. My step-mom has some family that would step up and be guardians, however their first choice is me.

Now, I’m not anti-kids. I do want kids someday. I just…don’t want to promise to raise my little sister if anything were to happen. We’re not close, if our dad and her mom were to die, I would not be a familiar/comforting presence to help her through it. It would probably derail my life as well, and prevent me from being able to have a family of my own.

So, I rejected them.

My father got upset with me, and said I was being selfish. I pointed out she’d have other places to go, like my step-mom’s sister (their second guardian choice). I said if it ever came down to truly no one could take her and I was the last possible family member then I would, but I would not be first choice and I wouldn’t sign any paperwork. The dinner ended coldly, my father is pissed. I got an e-mail from my step-mom saying “I’m sorry your father yelled at you, but I hope you understand why, he just wants your sister taken care of”.

0,"AITA for refusing to hold a baby? | I don't like children. I never have, and the fact that my older sister had a baby at 16 and I had to live with it for five years didn't help. Mostly this is not a problem because, aside from the occasional annoying restaurant or movie theater experience, I don't really *have* to interact with kids much. My boyfriend is also firmly childfree, as are most of our friends, so we just sort of live our own lives and don't hang out around kids.

One of my coworkers just had a baby and has been gone on maternity leave, and she visited the office with her baby the other day. Now let me make it clear, I'm not some grouch. She is one of those people who was born to be a mom and I'm really happy for her. So we had a mini party when she visited and I made a little cake and we were all happy to see her. I was asking her questions about baby stuff and how everything was going and being part of it, it wasn't like I was just sitting off in the corner brooding.

He is in Minnesota, I’m in Colorado.  I said it would be no problem to stay at my place, but I would likely be out of town for work.   I made and sent him a key to the apartment with parking instructions and directions, plus a few tips on inexpensive places to visit around the city.

I bought a hide a key for my car, but parking at the airport is inconsistent and it’s quite a large area.   I didn’t get much response, so two days before I was set to leave I messaged him: “you seem really aloof about all of this and it has actually been a good deal of planning on my part.

0,"AITA for being pissed off at my mom's boyfriend and expecting him to ask to watch tv? | My mom has been with her boyfriend around 6-7 years, they fight most of the time and every so often they have massive blow-up fights that get ugly. They fight about the same things all the time and it's just a vicious, repetitive cycle. They become verbally abusive to each other and have gotten physical in the past. 

In the 3 months I've been living with them, maybe 4-5 times I've been watching tv when he's come home. He usually gets home around 4:30 but sometimes shows up whenever. One night around 7:30 my mom and I were sitting in the kitchen and I put a hockey game on, he came home, didn't say anything to either of us, walked to the couch, picked up the remote and changed the channel without even asking if we were watching anything. Another time I was off work for the day and it was 2 in the afternoon and he came home and went upstairs for the rest of the night apparently because I was watching tv, but if he said he wanted to watch I would have had let him have the tv. My sister made a huge deal that I was in his space and shouldn't be watching tv, and my mom said whenever he comes home I should just go to the basement. I said it's unfair that everyone should have to bend to his will just because he gets upset at the smallest things, and he could just say he wanted to watch tv and I'd have no problem. My mom agreed with me that he was being ridiculous and rude, and I said I would not let him get whatever he wants just because he's a baby about it. 

So fast forward a bit and the 2 of them were fighting again and he called my mother a whore among other things, I guess my tv watching was somehow a part of it as well. They got into a massive fight when I was out of the house for an entire day, my mom said she ripped his shirt and the dog gate to the kitchen was smashed and she told me I had gotten my wish because he might never be coming back. Shame on me for thinking my mom had finally come to her senses because it lasted about 2 1/2 weeks and then a couple days ago she told me he was coming back and all of a sudden was framing it like me watching tv was the only reason they had fought and I was the issue. I told my mom I'm just not going to up and leave whenever he gets home, and if he wants the tv and I'm watching something, then he can say so and I'll have no issue. Apparently this was way out of line on my end and now my mom is telling him she hates me, that I'm lazy and I deserve nothing. I'm really confused by this 180 because she had no problem agreeing with what I said 2 weeks prior, but now her and my sister are painting me as the villain.

1,"AITA for making my kids pay for part of our family vacation? | My family and I hosted an exchange student from Prague a couple of years ago.  Last fall, his family offered for us to visit and stay in their flat in Prague.  I researched airfares and asked my two kids if they would be willing to pay $1000 each to cover their airfare.  At first, they declined but subsequently agreed.  They are 16 (twins) and have summer jobs.  They each already had enough in savings to cover the cost.

We are a middle class family (maybe more towards lower-middle class).  My wife has a disability so we are a single-income family.  We travel for vacations occasionally and I have never asked my kids to contribute to a vacation before.

The airfare turned out to be $775 each.  When I let my kids know this, I was surprised that my daughter was nearly in tears.  Her recollection was that I had told her the airfare was $375.  This is the cost for the return airfare - I don't know where the miscommunication came in. She is VERY fastidious with her money and this extra cost really upset her.  I explained that the original amount I told them was $1000 and that this was a deal.  I told her that she would have to pay the $775 or that she could not go.  If I offered her a reduced fare, I would have to do the same for her brother. The trip would then cost me an extra $800.

My wife says that IATA because parents shouldn't charge their kids to go on vacation.

My boyfriend and I have been together 2 years, and lived together for 1.5 years. We live in a smalllllll studio in a HCOL area. We’re fully aware that not everyone could live like we do, and that we give up a lot to meet our savings goals. And that we live on top of each other. For the vast majority, we fight rarely, and get along quite well.

It’s important to note that I signed this lease independently, and he moved in unexpectedly 3 weeks later. Although it was a surprise, we decided to make it as intentional a decision as possible. It’s been important to me for him to feel like this is just as much his home, but he sometime struggles (and I get it).

Now the issue: he’s been laid off. His emergency fund can cover him for at least 6 months (this is an estimate, I haven’t seen his financials nor has he laid out a detailed budget — yet). I’ve expressed an interest for him to take a bit of time off while job searching, and explore one of his hobbies. This hobby has a potential to make cash eventually, and he’s really way more of a creative than his career allows. I’d love to see him pursue it more.

He got really excited about this idea this morning, and told me he’s thinking about a 2 month road trip to really dive in and explore! That’s more than I was thinking, but we began to discuss it. At one moment he mentioned maybe 3-6 months.

Then he asked, “So here’s my question, if I weren’t living here during that time, would I still pay rent (and utilities)?” I said, ”YES you would still be paying your 50% portion of the rent because it’s your choice to leave and do this. I’m open to discussing utilities as you’d be unemployed and I want to support your adventure.” 

This caused some tension. As wonderful as he is, occasionally I think he can be self-serving.

He brought up that it’s my lease and I lived here first, and had moved here with the intention of paying the full price on my own. I said, while that’s true, that hasn't been what became our reality.

Anyway plans were made, tickets purchased and then my parents who had originally told us they did not want to go as they were eyeing a cruise at the same time, decided that we were horrible as we should have known they really wanted to go.

This is typical behavior by them but as they live in another city thousands of miles away we do not have to deal with them often and grin and bare it when we do. Anyway they pouted until we got them tickets, which I had to pay for even though my parents are very well off and easily could afford plane tickets on their own.

Two weeks later my parents mention their good friends also got tickets and would be joining us. Now we are pissed because we had our trip planned down to a t, and my parents and their friends were not going to want to do half the things we wanted to do.

So I made my parents aware that since they hijacked our vacation, they were responsible to arrange for plans for their friends and themselves. My mom became agitated and said that what is the point of a family vacation if we were going to do our own thing. I responded that it was not a family vacation because she invited their friends therefore they needed to come up with their own itnerary.

I said ""no...I'm talking about your baby..."" which I thought was obvious. Sister then said that my GF won't technically be an aunt and after some back and forth between us she said she won't be making her child call my GF ""aunt"".

I think this is rude. It's not like I'm a teenager or bringing different girls home all the time. My GF and I have been together for four years now and she knows my sister pretty well. They're not best friends, but they get along just fine. My GF and I are in this for the long haul and marriage is on the horizon in the next few years, we just want to get settled in our jobs and home before that.

In the end my sister said that because we're not married she won't have her child call my GF aunt because apparently if we break up it'll be confusing for the child.

1,"AITA for confronting a woman idling in a take-out only parking spot? | Sometimes I call-in for takeaway from a local Italian place. It's in a mixed-use shopping center with a bunch of restaurants & retail on the ground level and apartments above. There's one main strip of parking that's more than half taken up with parking spots dedicated to specific shops. If nothing on the main strip is available you have to park in a garage behind the apartments and walk all the way around (about 5 minutes) to get to the shops. The Italian restaurant is at one end of the shopping center, and there are two take out only spots branded for the Italian restaurant.

I pulled into the parking lot at about the time my food was supposed to be ready. One take-out spot had a parked car and the other had a person sitting in the car with the car running and lights on. I figured she might be about to leave, since the car was running, so I circled all the way around hoping for an open, undedicated spot (which was not likely and there weren't any), and assuming she'd be gone by the time I came back around. I circled once and saw the car still parked there. The person was just sitting in the car, with the engine running, in park, lights on, and didn't appear to be doing anything. I made another loop to check if any spots had opened in the meantime, and then went back around to the garage. Walking back down from the garage she was still. Just. Sitting there. Lights on. Engine running.

It had been at least 10 minutes since I first saw her idling, so I got pretty annoyed. I knocked on her window and said ""Hey, this is a take-out only spot. I just had to circle around and then park all the way over in the garage because you're just sitting here. Thanks a lot."" To which she said ""I'm waiting for take-out."" I assumed she was lying, so I just rolled my eyes at her and went in. I waited in line and picked up my food, and as I was coming back out, I saw her walking in. We made eye contact and she sarcastically said something like ""Here to pick up my food!"" as I passed her. 

To be clear, this place does NOT have curbside service. You have to walk in, wait in line, and pay to pick up your food. The only thing I can guess is that she pulled in, called in a take-out order when she was already in the parking spot, and waited the 15-20 minutes for her food to be ready in the car with the engine running. I guess I probably shouldn't have confronted her, but by the time I'd come back around I was so frustrated to see her STILL sitting there when it had been unreasonably long. It really seemed like she was just idling in the spot waiting for a friend to come down from the apartments or something.",False,False,2,4,1,3,1,3,Fairness
0,"WIBTA if I told my mother to go f*ck herself? | Repost because I am the big dumb and ignored the rules. Forgive me, almighty mods.

So. To explain.

About four years ago, when I turned eighteen, my stepfather made good on the promise fffat I was being evicted. Literally walked in at six in the morning and said ""You're no longer my legal responsibility. You're not even my real son. Get the fuck out of my house."" I lived in a seperate building on the property for about three years because I was eighteen, barely graduated high school, never made enough to live in an apartment. This seperate building was a storage shed that had no heating, no A/C, and no workingtoilet. But I made it work because I was desperate to survive. I slept through rat infestations, I woke up to scorpions, once the place flooded and fucked half my clothes and my matress, which was on the ground because again, broke.

Now, mind you, my mother's take on this whole situation was to watch me drag my furniture out of the house one by one and say literally nothing. This is also a woman who continuously bragged about ""Setting him (me) up with his own place to live"". A woman who said if I gave her 2,000 dollars, she'd buy me a car, which she did, then gave to my stepfather, and then demanded another two grand.

When I turned 21, I met my now fiancee. She took one look at where I lived and said ""Hell no."". I moved in with her and I haven't looked back since.

However, from time to time in the year since then, my mother will reach out. I've kept minimal contact as I don't want to deal with her, and also because there's no way I could be nice about it.

Today is different. It's my birthday. I'm 22 now. I'm financially stable, I'm happy, I've done almost everything my mother and stepfather tried to keep me from doing.

She texted me happy birthday, told me how much she loved me, and honestly, I want to tell her how I truly feel. But, I don't know if telling her to go fuck herself is gonna be the best choice in mind as I still have a good relationship with my grandmother on her side and a good relationship with most of my extended family.

0,"AITA for refusing to go on Christmas holiday with my family? | This Christmas 2019, my parents planned to go to Canada to see relatives. They initially offered to pay for me as I have just started my job after graduating, therefore I have not saved much. I even said I'd be willing to split the cost of flight as we are flying from UK, therefore flights will be around £700 at Christmas time.

&#x200B;

Cut to today, dinner, Dad says Mum ""accidentally opened and read my payslip from work"". Mildly annoyed, I roll my eyes but don't make a big deal out of it because believe it or not this does not come as a surprise (also because I'm exhausted from work). Coincidently, my Dad brings up Canada:

""Well, since you're earning \[X amount\], I'm sure you can probably pay for your own flights now""

I reply: ""I might not be able to because I can't afford it right now, I'm trying to save""

""But you are earning \[X\], surely this is nothing to you. Start saving now \[Y amount\] every month""

I stay quiet because them using my payslip against me AND telling me how to spend my money has severely put me off.

Dad, noticing I've stopped talking: ""I have no words for you... You can't even do this for your family""

Classic. 'Asian guilt trip method'. I reply: ""It's not to do with family, I just don't have £700 to be throwing around""

Mum: ""But you have the money for you and your boyfriend to go on holiday""

I knew they would go for this. That holiday cost less than half of what they're getting me to pay.

I once again repeat that I cannot go and promptly leave after this to avoid further stress.

I might add that I'm not just being a cold-hearted brat, refusing to see relatives for Christmas. These relatives are ones I've not seen or talked to in almost 10 years, not very much in common, grew apart - thus you can see why I won't exactly be devastated. Second, if my parents hadn't gone down the ""let's mock/guilt trip her"" route I would've been far more inclined to go out of my own pocket. Who would want to spend Christmas away from family?

0,"AITA for telling my roommate’s boyfriend we’re not friends? | So I (23f) have a roommate (23f) who we’ll call Jill. I like Jill, we have a good bit in common in terms of interests and personality, but we’re not super close. The Tuesday before Valentine’s Day, Jill mentioned she met a guy (Jack) and he’d asked her out for Valentine’s Day. She said yes, they went out, and apparently hit it off because they’ve been going out regularly the last 3 weeks and he has stayed the night a few times.

Last week she casually mentioned that Jack is 42 years old. This shocked me because he seriously does not look like it. I would have guessed he’s in his mid-late 20s. This is something that really bothers me but I try to not judge and remind myself it’s none of my business. I was hanging out in the living room one evening this weekend when Jill and Jack came home and also settled in the living room. After hearing their conversation for a while and participating in it a little, i knew I did not care for this guy. He was condescending and patronizing to Jill about her opinions and any pop culture thing she hadn’t seen or wasn’t into (she is very into books, but not much TV/film/internet/modern music). He was also extremely pretentious, but once I casually corrected him on some of the “facts” he was spouting he stopped trying to lecture Jill while I was in the room. 

Pretty soon I went off to my room to do my own thing. When I went out to the kitchen to get some water, Jack was playing on his phone and talking to Jill. He looked up as I passed and said “Oh kitkat1701 I sent you a friend request on Facebook!” My response was just “Oh. Ok.” Then I went to bed.  I ignored his friend request because I barely know this guy and frankly already don’t like him that much and he makes me uncomfortable. Even if I got to know him better, I wouldn’t want to connect myself to him right now because he’s not a significant part of my life.

The next morning, Jack immediately stopped me the minute he saw and asked why I hadn’t accepted his friend request. I didn’t want to be dishonest, so I said “Sorry, I don’t really friend people I don’t know”. Jack said “What?? You know me!” “Yeah, a little bit, but not really. I know who you are, but we aren’t close or anything”. He still seemed confused about this and kept pushing. So I finally said “Jack, I add people on social media who I am friends with or significantly connected with. You’re my roommate’s new boyfriend, and we’re not friends. I don’t want to add you.” He got pissed and stormed off, with Jill running after him.

Later Jill came to me and said Jack was really insulted by what I said, and she felt I had been really rude and over the line. She wants me to apologize. I had thought I was just being firm with my boundaries, but now I’m worried that I was too harsh. So what do you all think?",False,False,3,4,2,3,1,4,Fairness|Proportionality

My girlfriend ""Julia"" can sometimes be unaware of the social clues people around her are giving off, especially when she has been drinking. 

This was the case last night when we went to go hang out and have dinner at a friend's place. Over the night Julia had a lot of wine and we ended up staying until almost midnight when this happened. 

I could tell that our friends really wanted us to leave so they could go to bed but are too nice to actually tell us to leave. It was getting super uncomfortable and Julia just was not picking up on any of this. At one point when we ended up alone in the living room for a minute I whispered to her that ""I think they want to go to bed. We should head out now."" 

She told me to stop being ""ridiculous"", that they were all having fun and I was trying to ruin her ""good time"". I decided to give it a little longer to see if she would pick up on the hints before I would remind her again that we should leave. 

By the time I reminded her for the second time, it was 12:30 and everybody but Julia was irritated. I asked my friends straight up when Julia was in the bathroom  if they wanted us to leave and they finally said yes. When she came back I told her that they said we should leave but she accused me of lying because I ""just want to go home."" 

I stood up, thanked our friends for having us, and grabbed Julia from behind by her waist, grabbed her stuff and put her in the car. Like I said she's a whole foot shorter so there wasn't much she could do to get out it.

When I put her in the car I told her she was being embarrassing and we were going home. She told me to fuck off but didn't say anything else about it until today when I was at work and she texted me that I was being an asshole last night and I shouldn't have picked her up like that, she's not a child, and she doesn't want to talk to me until I apologize. 

That's the thing, I don't know if I should be the one to apologize. She was the one disrespecting everybody's time and not listening to my attempts to get her to pay attention to our friend's hints that we should leave. I didn't know what else to do at that point.

0,"WIBTA if I complained to a barbers because they refused me service due to my gender? | A year or so ago I moved to a small town where there is only one high quality barbers near me. Whilst I usually go to the cheap barbers (money is tight) sometimes, if I have a special event coming up, I like to have my hair cut by a higher quality barbers as I do notice the difference in my hair cut when it's done somewhere more expensive. 

I pop in to this barbers and ask to book an appointment. I'm told politely (the people working in the barbers seem nice) that they 'don't do women's hair'. This seemed odd to me because my hair is incredibly short - shorter than your average pixie cut short. It is the same length/shorter than most men's haircuts I see, and follows the classic short-on-the-sides long-on-the-top style. As such, it had never occurred to me that a barbers would have any issues with cutting my hair - especially given that I always ask for a masculine cut when I get it done. 

I thought maybe it would be best to call the barbers and complain to the relevant person and express how I would have loved to have my hair cut there and am saddened that my gender prevents me from receiving their service. However, I checked with my friends and I got a different response. Most of them reckoned that, even though my hair is a man's hair cut, there could still be a difference between how it is cut compared to a man's. Further, they didn't really think it was discrimination because, in their words, 'barbers are for men'. 

Now I'm not so sure if it's appropriate for me to call and complain - it sucks that I won't be able to get my hair cut by a high quality barbers, but I do understand that barbers are, in a traditional sense, a place for men to get their haircut. And, even if it is a kind of discrimination for them to not cut my hair, I started to wonder if complaining is just going to cause needless fuss and not really make a difference beyond making a nuisance of myself, and if it may cause trouble for the employees there, which I wouldn't want to do. 

I know this is a rather small issue compared to what this sub usually features but this event has really made me question what I thought about barbers and where I can get my hair cut and so I thought this sub would be the best place to turn to.

Oh and a lizard of some kind, bearded dragon I think. But the worst pet he has is an Umbrella Cockatoo.

1,"AITA for reporting my son’s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he’s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. 

Two weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would “try his best”. 

That afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said “if you’re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.”

After that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. 

I called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would “look into it.” After a couple more days, he hadn’t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that “nobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he’s the best one at the school” (Which I sincerely doubt). 

I mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is “the nicest guy you’ll ever meet“ and that her children say my son is “extremely disruptive” on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn’t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.

0,"AITA for keeping the pots and pans in my room since my roommates do not clean? | I (20 F) live with three (all 20, F) other people. Roommate A is my best friend and overall a great roommate.

So the building managers emailed me and gave me the info for two other girls also looking for 2 more people. So we met in our student center, and they seemed like nice and fun people, we talked about standard roommates things (during which they both said they clean) and we decided to live together.

It became abundantly clear that neither of these girls clean up after themselves in a timely manner. Dirty pots, pans, dishes, and utensils would sit in the sink for over a week and not get cleaned. Eventually we had a conversation over text and they said just ask us to clean them and it will get done. Unsurprisingly, that did not work. So we continued having a sink full of dirty stuff and waiting til they eventually cleaned, usually over a week later. Also, it is VERY important to note that every single pot and pan, and most of the plates and stuff, are mine. My parents either gave me old stuff or I bought new ones. I also cleaned their dirty dishes often as I like to cook. We continued to text and the dishes would not get cleaned unless roommate A or I did it. Also, it is very hard for us to sit down and have an actual conversation about this with them, as they are both rarely home, and when they are they are either doing work or have friends over. We tried to have conversations numerous times during the first semester but it didn't happen.

One of the other two roommates made mac n cheese in the pan I use to cook most nights. She left the mac n cheese in the pan with a bowl on top of it on the stove for a week. I eventually asked her to clean it as it was starting to smell awful and I did not want it to ruin my pan. She said she would. Her definition of cleaning was filling the pan with water and sticking it in the sink, which was already full of dishes from her and the other bad roommate. A few days later, roommate A wanted to cook and clean so she took all the dishes out of the sink, cleaned them a little, and put them on the coffee table so she had sink room hoping they would see them and clean. They did not. I eventually texted AGAIN, and no one responded and nothing got done.

So after numerous attempts to get them to clean like the somewhat-adults we are, nothing had changed. I cleaned all the pots and pans on the coffee table (there were 3, there was also stuff on the coffee table that they brought to the apartment, so I left it) used one of them, cleaned it again, and now all the pots and pans are in my room.

I told him that I would rather take the money from the car sale and put it towards the vehicle I want: a truck. Not a big huge truck like he drives, just a small one like a Dodge dakota or similar size. I've been wantind a small truck for years and have told him that so many times i can't count.

So back in college, I met this guy (M) in one of my classes. He wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed and struggled with a lot of the assignments.

Now, I would regularly help out a few struggling classmates with their assignments. One day, M found our study group and asked for help on the particular assignment we were currently working on in our group.

I told him that I would be happy to help, but M didn’t have the assignment on him at the time, so he asked if he could email me the assignment and if I could help him later that night since the assignment was due the next day. I said that was fine, but I had work later so he would have to wait until later that night. 

I got home from work and found an email from M in my inbox. He sent me what he had so far and it was clear that he put in little to no effort. Everything was either completely wrong or incomplete. I took roughly an hour to reply to him with a very thoughtful, well-written, constructive email with feedback on what he can do to improve his work. He later replied and instead of saying “Thanks for your help” or asking a follow up question, I got the letter “K”. A “K” in return for the time I took out of my evening to analyze his shitty work and explain to him what the professor had already explained in class. I was pissed, and I didn’t help him after that.

A few weeks later after the class I had with M ended, I was working on an assignment in one of the common areas on campus and M found me. He came and sat down next to me and started bragging about how he had made $400 working 40 hours at his internship. I wasn’t having it, so I made up some excuse, got up and left.

I didn’t see him much after that, but I heard from a lot of friends that he would regularly manipulate people to do his assignments for him and brag about how much money he was making to everyone and anyone.  

Fast forward to present day, all of my friends graduated college and we are all working jobs that we enjoy. One day out of the blue, I got an invitation from M to connect on LinkedIn. At first, I was just going to decline it, but my curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to see what he was up to, so I accepted. I saw his profile and it didn’t appear that he was able to hold onto any job for longer than a few months, which wasn’t surprising since the guy would just have other people do his assignments for him. I told my friends who knew him and we all had a good laugh about it since it seemed like this manipulator got what he deserved. 

A few days later, he messaged me on LinkedIn asking me if I was enjoying my current job. I just ignored it and went on living life.

A few weeks after that, he messaged me again asking the same question. Again, I ignored it and moved on.

Then a few days ago, he messaged me once more asking if I ever consider employment opportunities outside and in addition to my current job. For the hell of it, I replied saying that I do and I asked him what he had in mind. The TL;DR of the conversation we had over a week is that he was working with a wealthy couple who set him up with the opportunity to help other individuals start their own business selling products and services. He bragged about how this opportunity was going to allow him to retire in two years and by joining this MLM (pyramid scheme) I could potentially retire early as well. The whole time he was really defensive about all of the details (he wouldn’t tell me specifically who he was working with, what products he was selling, etc.) 

Turns out, he was messaging my friends as well about he same “opportunity”. We all began replying to him and asking for more details just to waste his time. The way we see it, the more time he spends talking with us, the less time he has to actually manipulate someone who is unsuspecting. 

In his last message, he was asking if we could meet up for a “pre-interview” and I was going to finally just block him and move on with my life. However, I was telling one of the interns at work (who goes to the same school M and I went to) about this and he told me that M regularly makes trips out to campus to prey on unsuspecting students and try to get them to join his pyramid scheme. His latest victim has apparently been a special needs student and this just made me hate M more.

I am thinking about scheduling a meeting with him out in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere just to waste more of his time and then just no-show and block him once and for all.

Anyways I want my wedding day to be about my fiancé and myself, I want it to be an opportunity for his family to bond with my family from Europe, etc. Since my parents divorce, and since his GF has entered the picture, my father has become an alcoholic, when his gf is around he won’t acknowledge my mother’s family who he is still very close with etc. At my wedding though a lot of his friends would still be there as I have grown up around them and see them as family. 

So am AITA for telling him she can’t come because I’m scared she’ll make the day about her and her daughter? Or should I just bite the bullet and tell him she can come?",False,False,4,5,3,2,1,4,Fairness

 So I was planing to got out with my college friends on the day (we are on our vacation) and have fun, but sudenly I was *informed* that we were going out to celebrate *and* that my brothers (16M and 14M) and their girlfriends were going. 

So now i have to not just forget my plans, but instead of going out with my friends i have to go out with my brothers and two girls that I have, maybe, spoked 1 time. As you can see I wasn't very happy, but i decided that i could just go out with my friends later and pass some time with my family. Everything fine, right ?

Well, they decided to just ignore my opinions of where we are going to because one of the girls don't like there, and they were making plans knowing that I'm working without asking me. And sudenly they 5 (brother, girlfriends and mother) were justing deciding everything and just using me to have an excuse to go out, nothing more. 

So I'm seriously just thinking in saying that I'm going out with my friends anyway. But I do think this can be assholish or at least childish, so I'm letting you guys help me decide. WIBTA if i just say that I'm going out with my friends ?

0,"AITA for refusing my neighbors' request to cut down a tree on my property? | We just bought a house and the backyard has a giant silver maple tree in it. The house is little and the tree is right in the center of the lot and it's massive. It's about 70 feet tall and the spread is about 50 feet. I LOVE this tree. It's a big part of why we bought this house. The tree shades the house and the lot and keeps it cool and comfortable even on hot days. And, it's just beautiful! 

Shortly after moving in the neighbors on each side pulled us aside while we were in the yard and suggested that we should have the tree removed. They are concerned that if it falls it will fall on their homes. We have had an arborist come over to check out the tree and they said the tree shows no sign of being unhealthy. That a freak storm could bring down any tree so while it's not totally impossible that it falls it's not likely any time soon. The lifespan of the tree is 130 years and it was planted in 1927 so it could live for another 40 years. Also, we are well insured and if the worst did happen and the tree comes down any damage it caused would be covered by insurance. 

Despite me showing them the report from the arborist, the information about the lifespan of the tree, etc they still have requested that we remove the tree because they feel that *any* risk is too much risk. 

So, am I the asshole for refusing to take down a perfectly healthy tree that could live another 40 years?

1,"AITA for comparing my boyfriend to an autistic child who needed to be driven around to calm down? | I was driving my boyfriend and I back to my house (parents house) where we were staying that night. We had been having an argument about how he acts around my family, I think he's unfriendly to the point of being rude (for example he has walked into a room where my brother was and not bothered to say hi. I've had to tell him to say hello.) At the start I thought it was due to shyness which I was sympathetic to but recently I've gotten a bit of an irritated vibe off him and felt he just can't be bothered making an effort with them.  Anyway, this is what we had been arguing about in the car and he had said ""I'm sorry if sometimes I'm in a bad mood, or tired and I'm not overly enthusiastic around your family"" to which I said that I would understand if you were only like that occasionally, but it's all the time. He then said that it wasn't all the time and I conceded and said ""ok, well you're like that 9 times out of 10"". He flipped at this and called me a liar, saying that I had lied when I said he was ALWAYS like that because I had changed it to '9 times out of 10'. He said I had lied and had admitted it by changing what I said immediately after. I was 100% that this did not make me a liar and I think it's just him nit-picking, but maybe I'm wrong. At this point he was shouting at me which I hate and the argument wasn't going anywhere so I said I was done with it. We were close to my house at this point and I asked him if we were going into my house would he stop shouting as I didn't want my parents seeing that, but he said he wasn't calm enough to do that yet. So I said ""So I have to drive you around until you've calmed down, like you're an autistic child?"" The reason I said this is because I've heard of parents of autistic children having to do this and it reminded me of this. So he completely flipped at this and started going on about how horrible a person I was for talking about autistic people like this. This is coming from someone who used to do an impression of a Down's syndrome person on a TV advert. He says he has changed since he used to do that and isn't that sort of person anymore. So we spent about 20 minutes more driving around as he was threatening if we went back to my house he would go and ask my parents what they thought about what I said. I couldn't care less if they knew what I said but I didn't want them being dragged into the argument. I told him he could message his friends to see what they thought, I don't know if he did. I asked if he had anywhere else to stay for the night as I essentially wasn't able to go home as I was afraid he'd drag my parents into the fight. He eventually said he wouldn't do this and we were able to go home. I don't think he will speak to me until I apologise for the autistic comment. I think he was wrong in calling me a liar when I don't think I was and for having me drive around for ages because we weren't able to go home because he was threatening to make things awkward at home.

So I’m a freelance artist, and for the longest time I tried to be the good guy. Every time I ran into someone tracing/stealing/reposting my art without permission I would message them nicely asking that they remove it. I spent over 4 years doing that and it got me absolutely nowhere. I would always get ignored/blocked.

Eventually, I just said fuck it. Why should I be expected to be nice to these people, when they shamelessly stole my hard work?

Of course they can just make another account to pull the same shit, but they will inevitably get called out again and the cycle repeats.

Not even 24hrs later I start getting blasted by their friends(?) for harassing them and “making them leave Twitter”, I’ve got random people tagging me saying how horrible I am and that I should’ve just asked them nicely to take it down.

0,"AITA For getting upset at my GF doing things backwards? | Basically my(M29) GF(F27) likes to do things.... without order to say the least. We've been together 3 years now.

We've had *multiple* conversations about it but it always leads to ""my time my choice"" sort of thing, which would be fine if it was only *her* time on the clock. She's one of those ""take a shower then take a poop"" kind of people and it has always boggled my mind. This was never an issue until we moved in together.

Examples of what I'm talking about: We went shopping for groceries the other day. We made multiple stops to Walmart, Costco, Petsmart and Bulkbarn for multiple things. Walmart and costco are near us but on the opposite side of the road not on the way there but on the way back, petsmart and bulkbarn are equally separated between us but in a circle. Logic would dictate you go to petsmart and bulkbarn but hit up walmart and costco on the way back right? She disagrees. She just goes wherever she wants whenever she wants regardless of where we have to be later. In fact she went to walmart, then petsmart, then costco and then bulkbarn and came back. This has caused us to be late MULTIPLE times to places afterwards because she doesn't care to think of time scaling or traffic. This trip should have been *at most* 1 hour which then turned into 3.5 hours because she went all willy nilly to different places at different times and not caring for traffic at all which led us to be late for a party at my friends house by over an hour.

Another example is when we had to tackle some yardwork and we started on it which should have taken 2 hours at the most turned into 4 hours because she decided halfway through to take a shower for some reason and then get all sweaty again afterwords and had to take another shower.

These types of things make me do that thing that Terry Crews does in Brooklyn 99 and go ""WHYYYYY?"". I've explained to her we need to respect timings but she doesn't seem to give a shit. My last straw was when we had to go somewhere but I needed my clothes clean and she offered to do them. She decided cleaning ALL THE OTHER CLOTHES before mine(about 3 loads) knowing full well I needed them in 2 hours was okay. My time in the military may have made me overzealous of timings but I feel she's being overly uncaring of other people's time.


I finally asked her why she doesn't care about other people's time and why she doesn't think about the most logical solution to how you attack a problem when it comes to times and she got upset and said I was being controlling. Not once did I tell her WHAT to do only told her she needs to respect that other people have constrictions that need to be adhered to if she tells them she's going to adhere to them. People's time isn't fluid it's to be respected and she seems to disagree.

Given the length of my employment, I have gotten close to many of my coworkers and have several of them on Facebook. My father is also my friend on Facebook. 

He likes to tag me in “controversial” articles he on Facebook about my restaurant (most recent being an article about possible human meat in a sandwich). I don’t always see it right away, hence my inability to promptly remove the tag. My manager has come to me on a few occasions and has told me that this is unacceptable, as when he tags me in posts it is visible on my timeline and others might see these things and get bad ideas. I have tried to talk to my father about this before, but he just says he thinks it isn’t that big of a deal. 

This most recent post (the one about human meat) was the last straw. I got really upset, and asked him, again, to please stop tagging me in these things. He asked what the deal was, so I explained it to him again. I told him he was going to get me fired, and we can’t afford for one of us to be out of a job.

I'm (17F) the eldest child, and so basically have been a live in nanny/ babysitter / parent no. 3 for my siblings (15F and 12M) since I was 12/13. 

My Dad was (and is) really strict on me, especially in comparison to my little brother. When I was my brother's age, I was in bed at 9 pm EXACTLY every night. He technically has a 9 - 9.30 pm bedtime, and my mum really tries to enforce it, but my dad either completely forgets about it or tells my mum to shut up when she asks him to get my bro to bed, usually because he's busy watching TV or youtube with him.

I hate the way my dad treats my mum, and I hate how he is allowing my little brother to become a spoilt brat, with absolutely no responsibilities or rules that he has to follow. 

This anger has been building up for a while, and it was why I did what I did tonight. So, heres what happened.

My mum asked me to go tell my brother to get ready for bed at around 9, so I went downstairs to the office/guest bedroom/ tv room/ whatever to relay that message. Brother and dad are watching what looks like some horribly violent war thingy, loads of bomb sounds and gun noises etc, and I shout over the tv to tell them that bro should get to bed soon. Dad says ok, they'll stop at the end of the scene, so I left them to it. I came back at 9.30, neither of them had moved, so I repeated the instructions, and got screamed at to leave the room because ""it was the most important bit!!!"". I was honestly just so sick of their crap so i just reached in and switched it off and walked away, because my brother has to get to bed on time on a school night, and I had already given them half an hour's warning to pause the bloody thing. 

They both went ballistic, started swearing at me, calling me a stupid cow, a bitch, and the likes, which is the kind of behaviour I can somewhat justify from a 12 year old, but not my 55 year old father. My dad followed me back upstairs, fully screaming at me, calling me abusive, obsessed with being in control, a psychopathic bitch, etc etc. I screamed back, calling him a child, and saying that I wouldnt have to do this kind of shit if he bothered to actually parent his child! He then accuses me of assault, supposedly for turning the tv off, which was interesting.

My dad starts yelling at my mum next, saying that it was her fault for making me relay her messages instead of coming down herself, which isn't fair bc my mum was busy cooking dinner for tomorrow. By this time i'm like fully sobbing, screaming at him to shut up and leave us alone, but he just keeps on yelling so I just ran to my room in tears. 

I feel kinda bad about turning the tv off, i'd probably be mad if it happened to me, but I feel like my dad's reaction was completely unreasonable.

0,"AITA for not giving up a spot in line? | The grocery store near my office has a sandwich counter in the deli section, where I sometimes eat lunch.  The other day, I get into the line for the sandwich counter when I hear a voice saying “excuse me, there’s a line here.”  I turn around and I see a man standing behind me by himself in the bakery section, by a display, a good 4-5 feet away from me.

Now, I get not crowding the person in front.  I usually leave a gap big enough for an average sized person to comfortably walk through.  I think any more than about 2 people’s width is a bit excessive, and 4-5 feet behind me (which would make him about 7 feet behind the person in front of me), in another section of the store, is completely ridiculous.  If you’re that far away, you are not actually in the line any more.  But, whatever, it’s a grocery store sandwich line and not a hill worth dying on, so I step back and wave him forward.  He doesn’t move.

About 20 seconds later, the line moves and I step forward, still leaving enough space for him to step in to.  Then he says; “well?  I was waiting here before you.”  He still hasn’t moved and clearly expects me to move behind him.

At this point, I decide that I’m not going to give up the spot that I still consider rightfully mine  if he’s going to be a dick about it, so I say “yes, there is a line and I’m standing in it.  You’re not.  You were waiting before me but you weren’t waiting in the line.  This isn’t take a number, we’ll call you when it’s your turn, this is a line.  You need to stand directly behind the person in front of you, not some place kinda close by.”  Then I stepped forward to close the gap and not let him in.

He says, “well, I guess not everybody cares about personal space” but steps up so that he’s directly behind me.

0,"WIBTA for telling my roommate to remove his belongings from the room I pay for? | I live in a 3 bedroom (2 upstairs, 1 downstairs) house with 2 room mates, one of which is my partner. I was the last roomie to move in when their previous friend moved out. When i came into the house i assumed all of the old room mates bills for internet, utilities, rent, etc. Our room mate (T) lives in one of the bedrooms upstairs and my partner and I sleep in the bedroom downstairs together, and I have kept the other room upstairs (that is technically the room that I am renting) as mostly a sensory/decompression/meditation/reading/crafting space that doubles as a guest bedroom for when friends come over. It doesn't have a lot of things in it, just a mattress and some personal items of mine that I use when it's time for some ""me"" time. T is a bit of a hoarder and has stuff overflowing from his bedroom (upstairs) into the hallway, lining his living room space, stuffing his cabinet space, the garage etc. I don't mind the clutter as he keeps it organized and keeps it in his own spaces.

I had fallen into a depressive state the last few months and had not been using the room much because i had lacked the motivation to do the things I enjoy.

Upon going upstairs I saw that T has started moving his crafting supplies into the room, completely lining one of the walls and making the room smell of leather, dye and other unpleasant chemicals. I was never told, asked or even aware that he had started doing this or when exactly it occurred. His crafting supplies also fill the garage, upstairs hallway and most of his own personal space. It had even been brought up in the past when he asked a few months ago what we plan on using the room for and suggested a crafting room and he was told sorry, no, it would be a personal decompression space.

I am a person that takes my coziness very seriously and I can not use the room for its purposes when I can barely breathe when I walk into the room, so just pretending it isn't there is not going to work for me unfortunately. The room may not have been used much over the last several weeks, but I do not believe that makes it free storage space. Luckily, I am also on the tail end of this depressive cycle and can see the room being in use in the very near future for my own projects.

1,"AITA for expecting my girlfriend to do most of the cooking and cleaning since I'm working? | We are quarantining together in her apartment (alone) since her roommates are now in NY and Georgia. Her parents pay her share of the rent since she is a college student and her tuition is funded by scholarships. However I help out too with my own money. I work part time, so not every day, but my job is now more dangerous and taxing. My gf lost her part time job (at some small food business) cuz of the outbreak, and she seems pretty upset about it, but to be honest, she has nothing to worry about financially so I'm not entire sure why. My parents don't support me financially. I've had to buy my own car, while her parents bought hers for her, so I see her as lucky. Not only that, but I'm in college too. I will admit that her classes are harder and more involved than mine, but I still have work to do for school.

Because I'm still working/doing schoolwork and she only has schoolwork to do, I leave the majority of the cooking and pet care to her (we have a cat) because I feel like it's more fair that way. She also does most of the laundry. It's been really nice because sometimes I work a 5 hour shift and then when I get back, dinner is made and the laundry is done and everything. 

This morning, I asked her to make me breakfast, because I had work in a couple hours, and she kind of exploded at me, saying she was tired too, and that I should make my own breakfast and leave her alone, she was sick of doing ""everything"" around the house. To clarify, she does not do everything. Most of the time, I wash the dishes after she's done making food.

0,"AITA for retaliating against the company snacks bandit/hoarder in a passive-aggressive, smart-ass way? | I work in an office where the person who does the occasional supply runs also brings snacks such as donuts, bags of potato chips, candy - whatever - for the whole company. Sometimes other employees (including me) also bring snacks for everyone, too. Etiquette dictates that you take one and leave the rest for others. Maybe the next day you take another.

Everyone except one guy seems to adhere to this unspoken rule. Mr. X makes a habit of grabbing a handful of lollipops, a couple of bags of chips, or even five bags of pretzels at a time, eating one and hiding the rest somewhere at his workstation. This results in some people hearing the “free snacks!” and then wondering where everything went when they go look at the tray. And no, Mr. X has never brought items of his own to share.

I  got pissed off one day and called him out on it. We had a short, spirited discussion about sharing, hoarding, selfishness, and what you were supposed to have learned in Kindergarten. He kept one lollipop and begrudgingly returned four others to the common bowl. I thought that was the end of it.

Last Friday, I happened to see Mr. X hiding six bags of chips behind his computer.  Instead of confronting him directly again, here’s what I did:

I bought three gigantic party-sized bags of chips. Before Mr. X arrived at work yesterday, I removed the small bags, and in their place, put the three gigantic bags. Sometime during the day he put the giant bags, unopened, in the tray with the smaller bags of snacks in the common area.

If  he had questioned me, I was prepared to say: “I saw you took six bags of chips and hid them. I felt sorry for you that you’re so broke and starving that you feel you have to take six times as many snacks as anyone else and hide them. You  shouldn’t have to steal to eat. I put back those tiny little bags and  bought you three giant bags of chips instead, so you won’t go hungry. I  tried to do it anonymously so you wouldn’t feel ashamed.” He never spoke to me, though, so I didn’t get to give my prepared speech. Before you ask: no, he’s not broke or starving.

I learned later that Mr. X confronted the supply guy, thinking he was the culprit for my prank/smart-ass retaliation. Mr. X asserted ""there's a reason I take the small bags - they're portioned out and with my diet, I'm only allowed  to eat a certain amount every day"". Well, sounds like the selfish jerk has justified to himself why his shitty behavior is okay. I still say it's not okay. AITA?

0,"AITA for calling out my neighbours for stealing my Tide pods. | A bit of context to establish a pattern of disrespectful behaviour.

I live in the basement apartment of a house, the main floor is a separate unit as well as the upper floor/loft. We all moved in at the same time about a year ago and the landlord does not live in the house. Early on it became clear that unless I did most of the maintenance (snow shoveling, yard work etc.) it would not get done by anybody. I honestly don't mind doing it as I would rather look at a nice neat home and it gives me an excuse to get outside. That being said I have never even had gotten so much as a ""thanks"" from anyone else in the house.

I wont deny that this has built up a fair bit of resentment. The main floor tenants are also very inconsiderate with noise. Stomping in the doors and walking around with boots and hard shoes at night, having parties mid week and leaving their yappy dogs home alone barking all night on a regular basis. I have never complained to the landlord or the city about the noise and always addressed them directly in a respectful way rather than trying to get them in trouble.

Clearly this is about more than just Tide pods.

We share a laundry room with the main floor tenants and the top floor tenant has their own. There is a row of cupboards and we each have our own to keep laundry and cleaning supplies in and to this point I just trusted that no one would steal things like that from their neighbour. Well I had noticed that we seemed to be going through our pods rather quickly so I took a peek in their cupboard and saw that they didn't have any of our own so I decided to do a little experiment. I simply counted how many were in the tub waited until they did laundry and then counted them again. Sure enough there were two pods less. So I took the remaining pods out of the laundry room and left the empty tub on the dryer with a note that said ""buy your own, thief.""

For what it's worth if they had asked I would have gladly given them whatever they needed.

Later on that day one of them texted my S/O apologizing and saying they were ""in a bind"" and would replace the pod later. They played it off as if it was a one time thing which I do not believe although admittedly o do not have any proof one way or the other. Either way later on that day there was a whole new tub of pods outside my door. 

I am satisfied with the outcome. They took something that wasn't theirs, I called them out and they apologized and replaced. End of story. My S/O thinks ITA for being rude and creating a hostile living space.

For the longest time, we’ve had pretty much the same “routine” when we get into arguments. Usually it starts out with me either forgetting to do something or doing something wrong, she sees it, lets loose on me about it, and decides that it’s now a good time to bring up all the other shit I do or have done since our last argument that bothers her. I do my best to listen but once we reach the point where she’s laying it on too thick or I feel like she’s being unfair, I leave the house. If it’s a Friday or Saturday I just got for a long walk around the neighborhood and come back a couple hours later. Any other day of the week I’ll drive to my job, which I have a key for, and try to catch up on some paperwork for a couple hours. I then go back to the house.

Despite the fact that we get into these arguments, we have what I would call a pretty good marriage. 6 weeks ago, it changed a lot because my wife gave birth to a little boy, our son. She’s got another 6 weeks of maternity leave, I had 2 weeks off then I had to go back to work. Last night we got into our first big argument since he was born. I went through my usual routine, and ended up deciding I needed to sleep at work that night. When I woke up this morning, I had dozens of angry texts and a few missed calls (my phone automatically goes to Do Not Disturb after midnight) from my wife. She was pissed that I’m still “pulling this crap” after the baby was born. She’s always understood my routine before, and actually at one point said she was happy that I’m able to turn a bad night into a good morning (because I get extra work done and I’m always on time the next day). I get that she would want help with the baby but he was fine when I left, he was asleep in his bassinet and he had just had his diaper changed and drank a full bottle of milk about an hour before that. I can’t stand to be in the house when she’s going on her rants and I don’t see why I should have to sit there and take it from her just because at some point in the next few hours she might need help with something.

As I understand it, the garden is communal but the patios are private for each ground floor flat (I emailed my landlord just now to check if it’s the case).

I've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. 

When the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. I then asked the waitress, ""Does the Guac have onions?"" To which she responded, ""Yes, it does"".  I then proceeded to tell her, ""I have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?"" I told her I have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. After the waitress left, my date asked me, ""are you really allergic?"" To which I said ""no :D, but this way, we get fresh guac"". She was pretty impressed like ""damn, I'm stealing this one"". When the guac came in, I asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. 

The rest of the date went well. We ordered some drinks first and then food later. What I forgot to do when I was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. When I got my dish, I took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! She thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. I didnt know how to react so I just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. Her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so I tell him that I forgot to mention not to put onions and that I have a severe allergy. 

The first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  

(Side note: I don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. I have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but I know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, I thought it makes you cough a lot, I don't know why I thought that.) 

Cutscene to now: I start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. I tell him, ""I barely got any onions in the bite"". My date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. I told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that I'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. I asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (Not like we ate anyway) but I still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. 

After leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. I shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. Now it is important to note that the bus stop where I grab my bus to go home is RIGHT OPPOSITE THE RESTAURANT. I'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on Reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. He thinks that I am taking the bus to the emergency room.  

He kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. He felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. I finally gave up and told him , ""Okay"". In my head, I thought I'd just let him drop me there and then I'll take an uber back home. However, we get there AND HE WANTS TO COME IN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK.  I'm like hey man, trust me, IM OKAY. Nothing is going to happen to me. You can leave. It was so awkward. We were parked and he kept asking if I'm sure and I'm like yes I'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. 

At the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. We walk in the emergency room and I'm the only person there. Great. I had to walk to the nurse and tell her that I might be having a slight allergic reaction. Supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and I'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. ""Thank you so much for everything."" He gives me his number and tells me to inform him once I'm out. 

Here I am. A healthy 25 year old adult. Having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfU3k5g
Another nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and I had to sheepishly tell him, ""I think I might have been having an allergic reaction"". He says, ""Are you allergic to anything?"" And I go ""No"". 

He gave me a benadryl and sent me out. I then spent another $25 to Uber home. I told what happened to my friend and she said I was the worst kind of asshole. I learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy, but I don't think I was an asshole because I did try to avoid as much confrontation as possible, and even ensured the waitress and supervisor that it was all my fault. Sorry for the long text, but AITA?

0,"AITA for leaving my cousin's wedding because I didn't have a place at tables? | Okay so as the title says, today was my cousin's wedding. I was  waiting for this wedding ever since they got engaged. It was pretty nice as during the ""traditions"" I stayed with them the whole time, helped them prepare the whole thing, helped them with the guest and I felt really good.

The bad thing, though, happened 30 mins after the party started. I was seated next to my cousin's sister (we got along pretty well, as we were also classmates for 4 years). All safe and sound until I went to change my outfit for the night party. As I was heading to my place, there was my cousin's sister with her friend sitting on my place.

At first I accepted it, since I could fit right between them, but then she asked me to move out and wait for a bit till she finds me another place (it was already full, but I was fine, supposing her friend would just leave to his table)

15 mins pass and she didn't even flinch. They started eating and with me having nowhere to stay I decided to slowly back away and leave. I talked to the groom (my cousin) and he was sorry that this happened and I assured him that this was my choice to leave.",False,False,3,4,2,1,1,3,Fairness
0,"WIBTA for no longer writing my work schedule on the family calendar? | TL;DR After I (19M) got a new job in the evenings, I started to write my work schedule on the family calendar to ease my mom's worry, but it turned into my nosy brother using it to essentially keep tabs on me. I want to regain the independence that I gave up by writing down my schedule. WIBTA for refusing to write my schedule on the calendar? My doing it is completely voluntary, and I started it for my mom's sake in the beginning. 

**Long version**

So I (19M) live at home while I'm going to college and working. I just started a new job about a month that is part time evenings, so my hours are slightly different every shift and it's not every night either.

At first, I would just leave without giving any notice that I was leaving because I don't feel the need to announce to everyone that I'm leaving for work. Other members of the family do the same, and I just think what I would assume that they do when I leave: if I want to contact them, we all have phone 24/7.

My mom didn't like not knowing and would get worried when she saw my car gone and couldn't find me in the house until she realized that I left for my job. So I joked saying ""do you want me to write my weekly schedule on the calendar"". This wasn't a joke to her, and she said ""yes"". So I did that, and it was fine that people knew where I was and I didn't care *that* much.

But then a couple days into this new thing, I got home from work a little later. My brother asked me where I was during that half hour, and if I went somewhere after work. So I explained that I helped clean up. Similar scenarios to this happened a couple more times, and I asked half jokingly if he always checked when I'd leave and when I'd be home. He said yes.

My brother is the type that always needs to know **everything** even if doesn't concern him. He always eavesdrops on our parents convos and it's pisses me off. Cut to new years day, a co-worker was sick and asked if I could fill in for her. I said yes knowing that holidays pay more. I wrote it on the calendar when I knew, and left about an hour later. This time I let my brother know. He was confused because he thought that I wasn't supposed to work that holiday, and he did not at all trust me. I jokingly asked if he wanted to see the receipts meaning the texts, and he said yes. So I showed him, but he was still distrusting.

This last instance was really what did it for me. By me writing my work schedule on the family calendar, I lose part of my independence because they know more about my schedule, and more importantly, I give my brother more power over me. By writing my schedule on the calendar, if I want to do something and use the guise of work as an excuse, I can't. So like I need to prep for stuff like that.

Would I be the asshole if I told my family that I would stop writing my work schedule on the family calendar in an attempt to regain some of my independence?

0,"AITA for not putting on a “show”? | On mobile sorry in advance

I’m a 16 year old working at dominos to make some extra cash and buy a car of my own at some point. I’ve been there for a bit more then a year so I know the ropes.

It was a busy weekend afternoon in the store, mostly online orders but we had a couple in-store orders at the time. Then a mom and daughter came in and after placing a order, they sat waiting for the 15 minute wait time.

If you didn’t know there’s a little step stool at the front of the store to watch the “dough show” and it gives the kids a chance to watch and pass the time.

Like I said it was pretty busy and sorry to burst anyone’s bubble but... we don’t spin the pizza into the air everytime we make a pizza. Actually we rarely ever do and normally only do it if we have a kid watching us, but like I said it was a very busy day and we really didn’t have time to be putting on a show.

So when the little girl and mom standing behind her came up to the glass, I gave them a smile and continued to make the pizzas we were backed up on. I prepared the dough on the counter and spread it out. Keep in mind the daughter never complained and even at a ripe age of probably 5 or 6 she was embarrassed by her mother’s actions. The next conversation then ensued.

Mom: Aren’t you gonna throw it up in the air?

Me: I’m kind of backed up right now, if I get some room to breathe by the time your pizza is up I could probably do that for you.

Mom: it says “dough show” you have to throw it up

CoWorker: I’m very sorry but we really don’t have time to be giving a show right now

Mom: Well you don’t have to do the show, he does (me)

Me: I’m sorry but I’m not gonna be doing a show right now, your daughter can watch me make pizzas all she wants.

Mom: Well if your not gonna do the show then you must take the sign down

I was loosing my cool at this point which doesn’t happen often.

Me: I’m not doing a show or taking the sign down, your pizza is almost done anyways.

Mom: Fine, (daughter) come here.

They sat down which the daughter wasn’t very happy about because she was actually pretty interested in my form of pizza making.

The coworker next to me and 3/4 of my managers think I handled it well but 1 of my managers and a couple other co workers said it couldn’t hurt for me to throw up a pizza or 2.
